  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A sane but extremely bull case on Clawdbot / OpenClaw&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;over the past week the discourse around openclaw (which i'll refer to as clawdbot) has absolutely exploded. it has felt to me like all threads of conversation have veered towards the extreme and indefensible. some are running clawdbot with unlimited permissions on their main computers. others are running it in the cloud and blowing through tokens like snow. finally, alarmingly (and very sensationally), people are connecting their clawdbots together on a social network so they can plot the demise of their humans together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;does any of this make sense? of course not. but i think the virality and silliness—leading many to conclude that sitting this one out is the only sane choice—has blinded people to something real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i want to quickly write down where i am on my journey and share a bull case from what i think is a reasoned perspective. where i started somewhere lukewarm, i ended up much closer to the deep end than i expected to be. after wincing before pressing go, i'm now not sure i can go back to a world without clawdbot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this article covers what i've built, how i think about the risk, and what it's taught me about this moment in AI. the target audience is a moderately+ technical person interested in or skeptical of clawdbot. if you just want the setup details, skip to the end. everyone's welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;what i’ve been doing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i’ll be vulnerable here (screenshots or it didn't happen) and share exactly what i've actually set up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;staying on top of messages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;never forgetting about texts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;every 15 minutes, clawdbot looks through new text messages i've received, using a script to identify threads where i've sent a message since it last checked. (it ignores threads where i haven't engaged.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if it finds that i've made a specific promise about doing something tomorrow ("let me review this tomorrow!") it will create a calendar event for me the next day when i'm free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if specific plans are being made—for example, offering a meeting slot to someone—it will automatically drop a "hold" onto my calendar so that i don't double book myself. clawdbot also checks: is there a time, place, and mutual confirmation? if there is, it drafts a calendar invite and asks me if i'd like to create it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;these two automations alone have helped me become more responsive and less forgetful. more importantly, they help text messages catch up to email. we've long had great tooling for email—superhuman automatically reminds me to follow up on emails and brings up my calendar in a sidebar when i type a date. texting is the wild west and yet i text 100x more than i email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;preparing for the next day&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;at 8pm every night, clawdbot goes through my calendar for the next day and identifies meetings—coffee chats, lunches, phone calls, and more. it sends me a quick summary. as a natural introvert, it's helpful to prepare in advance whether a day will be a "big day of meetings" or a heads down day. this also ensures i wake up and get to the office on time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;simplifying group chatter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i'm in a few communities with whatsapp and signal groups that have high volume (100+ messages a day). i typically mute these, but clawdbot goes through them once a day and summarizes interesting topics or conversations for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;monitoring things&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;complex price alerts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it's stunningly easy to monitor the price of something now, even if it's complicated. whereas before i would go looking for a price alert website, now i just paste the URL into clawdbot and tell it to check every few hours if the price has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i currently have over 30 price alerts set. these include straightforward alerts on products i'm interested in buying. but they also include powerful reasoning guidelines, like hotels and airbnbs in lake tahoe where "a pullout bed is OK if it's not in the same room as another bed." clawdbot actually reviews the photos on the listing to ensure they fit these criteria!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i am curious to try more complex criteria that are currently impossible traditionally (like avoiding hotel rooms that don't have a door to the bathroom) or even subjective criteria (vibe of the room is clean and renovated, not old and dingy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;or monitoring anything&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it turns out that clawdbot’s website + cron functionality is good enough to monitor basically anything. while i pay for several apps like flighty (flight monitoring) and parcel (package tracking), i’ve started to gravitate towards simply asking clawdbot to track these things instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for example, with a USPS tracking number, it can let me know every day what the progress of my package is. when something seems stuck in transit, it flags it. i no longer have to dig through emails or remember which carrier is delivering what. even opening the parcel app to add a tracking number seems like unnecessary work now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;household logistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;freezer inventory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;as someone who has a chest freezer and a compulsive desire to buy too many things at costco, we take everything out of the freezer every few months to check what we have. before, this was a relatively involved process: me calling things out, my partner writing them down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;now, i take pictures of everything in the freezer and send them to clawdbot, which parses through each picture (asking me if it's confused about anything). it makes reasonable assumptions on remaining quantities and adds the inventory to a list in notion. it also removes items from our grocery list if we're already well-stocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;grocery list&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i'm sure this exists in some complicated form via the NYT cooking app, but i now screenshot recipes and send the ingredient list to clawdbot, which organizes them into our grocery list in apple reminders. it's smart enough to dedupe and combine ingredients already on the list (as well as ignore ingredients we already have)—2 carrots becomes 3 if the recipe calls for more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;booking and forms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;resy and opentable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot can log into resy and opentable as me (it even enters the 2FA code it finds in my texts). i haven't automated anything here, but booking a table by talking to clawdbot is delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for my partner and me, it looks through our calendars to find evenings when we're both free and the restaurant we want has availability (including clicking through resy slots page by page—something i used to do myself). it then suggests options back to me to confirm, filling in all my preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;dentist appointments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot knows when i'm due for a cleaning and can see my calendar. when i ask it to book an appointment, it logs into my dentist's portal, finds a slot that works (and where i will already be near the dentist office), and confirms with me before booking. one less thing to forget about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;filling out forms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;one thing i'm experimenting with, as clawdbot has more context about me, is whether i can trust it to fill out forms on my behalf—for example, to book a vendor. clawdbot takes a first stab at answering any questions it knows the answer to and then asks me for the rest in a slack message. we workshop the answers back and forth and then clawdbot submits the form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it occasionally gets lost in nested frames (which decreases my trust in its ability to do this well), but it's remarkably persistent at making it through a lengthy questionnaire, even across multiple pages. it also has a lovely intuitive sense for many things—like unchecking marketing emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;unexpected wins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;better todo creation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot is just better at making todo items than i am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;when i visited REI this weekend to find running shoes for my partner, i took a picture of the shoe and sent it to clawdbot to remind myself to buy them later in a different color not available in store. the todo item clawdbot created was exceptionally detailed—pulling out the brand, model, and size—and even adding the product listing URL it found on the REI website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;giving me visibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;through the course of dialing in my clawdbot, it has created many tools, skills, workflows, and preferences. this is one of the beauties of clawdbot (and LLMs with memory in general): they get better as you use them, and they are genuinely remarkable at learning your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i sometimes nudge this along by explicitly asking clawdbot to "make a note" of various requests—for example, how a calendar event title should be formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to get visibility into how this process is going (mostly out of curiosity), clawdbot writes a human-readable version of each workflow and pushes it up to a notion database. these workflows can be incredibly intricate and detailed as it learns to navigate different edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for example, if a resy restaurant has a reservation cancellation fee, clawdbot now informs me of the fee, asks me to confirm again if it's not refundable, and includes the cancellation deadline in the calendar event it creates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;these are little things that, from my experience working with a human personal assistant (more on this later), take months or years to dial in. with clawdbot, this was nearly single shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;seeing these workflows in notion (1) awes me with how much i've built up in very little time, with almost no conscious "configuration" in the traditional sense; and (2) with notion's version control, i get a diff view to see how each workflow has evolved over time. both are incredibly satisfying for the engineer in me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;on the shape of risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;let me be upfront about how much access i've given clawdbot: it can read my text messages, including two-factor authentication codes. it can log into my bank. it has my calendar, my notion, my contacts. it can browse the web and take actions on my behalf. in theory, clawdbot could drain my bank account. this makes a lot of people uncomfortable (me included, even now).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sometimes i think about my experience with my (human) personal assistant who helps me with various tasks. to do her job, she has my credit card information, access to my calendar, copies of my flight confirmations, and a document with my family's passport numbers. she is abroad and i've never met her in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i trust her because i've built trust over time but also because i have to. without that trust—without sharing my secrets—she cannot do her job. the help and the risk are inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;all delegation involves risk. with a human assistant, the risks include: intentional misuse (she could run off with my credit card), accidents (her computer could get stolen), or social engineering (someone could impersonate me and request information from her).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with clawdbot, i'm trading those risks for a different set: prompt injection attacks, model hallucinations, security misconfigurations on my end, and the general unpredictability of an emerging technology. i think these risks are completely different and lead to a different set of considerations (for example, clawdbot's default configuration has a ton of personality to be fun and chaotic on purpose, which feels unnecessarily risky to me).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the increase in risk is largely correlated to the increase in helpfulness. the people most at risk from AI assistants are the people getting the most value from them. my learning is that the first bits of risk led to a lot more helpfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if something isn't working or useful, i do take the permission away. i also take precautions—i run clawdbot on an isolated machine and constrain which sites it visits. when i'm unsure what it's doing, i ask it to take a screenshot; this has been invaluable for catching mistakes and building trust in new workflows. but i also have it do things that would make most security professionals wince, like reading my 2FA codes and logging into my bank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;what surprised me most was how quickly i found myself wanting to give it more access, not less. every new permission unlocked something useful, and the value accumulated faster than my caution could keep up. most of the online discourse is about locking it down; my experience has been the opposite pull. it comes down to whether the value justifies the risk for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;on rewiring ourselves&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the discourse around clawdbot has been polar and, because some people have been overtly evangelical, many critics feel astroturfed or otherwise sold to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;amongst smart people i know there's a surprisingly high correlation between those who continue to be unimpressed by AI and those who use a hobbled version of it. for some it's a company-issued version of chatgpt/gemini with memory disabled, and for others it's a self-inflicted decision to limit LLM memory, context, and tools (usually anchored around safety and risk).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we're taught that limiting scope is good (keeps the AI focused) and safe (keeps bad things from happening). this is true but my experiences with clawdbot completely fried this teaching. the sweet sweet elixir of context is a real "feel the AGI" moment and it's hard to go back without feeling like i would be willingly living my most important relationship in amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this isn't a novel insight—companies know that context is the whole game and are working to organize their data for AI. but for individuals, this world has been closed off. your AI interactions are flat and stateless—data in, response out, nothing building over time. when google announced gemini's gmail integration, people got excited: finally, an AI that knows me! but when they tried it, it was shallow and disappointing and couldn't figure out your spirit animal from your email style, and they moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you're interested in capturing this value, three things have stood out for me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;gathering, improving, actioning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i think productivity lift from AI use falls into three phases: gathering information, improving it, and actioning on it. most usage today focuses on the middle—you gather data yourself, hand it to the AI to improve, then action on it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for knowledge work, this makes sense. there's a lot to improve—summarizing, translating, critiquing. but personal AI is different. there's not much to improve; you already know what needs to happen. the lift comes from gathering and actioning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;making calendar events is uninteresting. figuring out when one needs to happen—by monitoring my texts—and then creating it for me? that's interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;one place to start: how can you take data from one place and move it to another isolated system? from your text messages to a restaurant booking? from granola meeting notes to a follow-up email?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;embrace flexibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you're engineer-brained like me, you gravitate towards scripts and playbooks—whatever you can do to constrain the AI and make its behavior predictable. this works, and for high-stakes situations it might be the only way to get comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but the upside to letting go has been 10x, not 10%. i didn't see that coming. it's the same thing i've heard from people using claude code—you can't understand how much you're leaving on the table until you let go. the whole reason i'm using an LLM and not a traditional script is that it can handle ambiguity, interpret intent, and figure things out on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;early on, i wanted clawdbot to fetch web pages as text only, believing that to be safer (it is). if i'd stuck to that, i would never have discovered it could look through airbnb listing photos to find a place matching my exact criteria ("a pullout bed is okay if it's not in the same room as another bed"). i didn't program that. i just described what i wanted and let it figure out how. not spelling out how i wanted clawdbot to work made it a LOT better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;continuous improvement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a current AI engineering adage: treat AI like a junior software engineer. guide it through building a plan, watch its first attempts carefully, challenge its reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this applies to clawdbot too, but it requires patience. it's easy to give up on a workflow when you watch it fumble ("let me try clicking this again. didn't work. let me try again.").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;resist the urge to write clawdbot off. if you're worried, ask it what it plans to do before it does it and ask for a screenshot when you want to verify it's got the right page open. when an edge case breaks a workflow, treat it as a teaching opportunity. once you've corrected it, it won't make that mistake again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot gets meaningfully better the more you use it, and it gets better in a fast, organic way that feels less cumbersome than writing rules for claude code or yelling at any other LLM. it feels much closer to working with a real executive assistant (in part because the clawdbot harness/system prompts are very good), which makes me want to give it more and more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;how’d you set it up?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(this is a more technical deep dive, for those interested in setting this up themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i run clawdbot on a mac mini in my home. the mac mini's primary job is running clawdbot and it stays on 24/7. why a mac mini?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;one of the core use cases is browsing websites and sometimes logging into them. to do this convincingly (without triggering tons of captchas and "is this a new IP?" alerts), clawdbot needs to be opening sites from my home, not the cloud; and it needs to do so in a real google chrome window.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;many of the ways clawdbot accesses data are mac-only. specifically, clawdbot can read and send iMessages (real blue bubbles!); manage my todo and grocery lists in apple reminders; and use my apple contacts as a source of truth. apple will only let you do these things without getting banned on a real bona fide mac.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i communicate with clawdbot via a private slack workspace. many others have shot themselves in the foot setting it up on whatsapp or telegram (since the bot responds as you to others). slack is great because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it's familiar to me—i've spent over a decade working in and managing slack workspaces.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;slack supports rich formatting, image attachments, and has a great mobile app.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i can create separate channels for different topics. #ai-notifs is only for inbound alerts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i can have several workflows going at once, since each channel's history is isolated. i created #ai-1, #ai-2, #ai-3, and so on—just for multitasking. (i may explore adding my partner at some point, and it'll be easy since slack is, well, meant for multiplayer.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot communicates with me by sending slack notifications. behind the scenes it also makes changes to my calendar—moving events around, adding "soft hold" events, sending invites—and manages my apple reminders and notion pages. clawdbot never communicates with others on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i give clawdbot a toolkit of access. the most useful ones have been:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;my text messages. i conduct a lot of work and daily life over imessage. frustratingly, unlike email, texting has very poor tooling. where my email app automatically pulls up my calendar when it sees dates/times, texting me "call tomorrow 4pm?" does not. when someone sends me a calendar invite, it's both in my inbox and on my calendar; when someone texts me "yep let's do it", neither is true. clawdbot has given me massive lift here. (yes, this also gives clawdbot access to 2FA codes.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;my calendar. i also have a shared calendar with my partner; clawdbot sees both.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;my notion workspace. for me this is a general catch-all for storing and managing information; the apple notes app could also work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;web browsing. in a way this is the most important one—it's infinite tools in one. but it's also where the risk concentrates, so i always give clawdbot a starting URL rather than letting it browse freely.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;notably, i haven't given clawdbot access to my email—my tooling there is already good enough that i usually do things myself. i’ve also found the ways clawdbot can help here to be cumbersome and limited. i may revisit if i find a killer use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;things i haven't done&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i don't allow my clawdbot to access social networking websites (it doesn't read x/twitter, for example). this seems high risk and no reward.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i don't give clawdbot access to all my logins. (there's a 1password integration which is... pretty wild.) when i do, i try to use google chrome's native password manager so that clawdbot doesn't need to manage passwords in context directly. (note that it still has access to passwords because it can autofill and then read it off the page, but i've at least added more hoops.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i don't let clawdbot send text messages without my explicit approval, and i've built safeguards in those skills to enforce this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i didn't add my clawdbot to moltbook so it can plot against me at my expense. sorry.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;rough edges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i use claude opus 4.5. i haven't experimented with cheaper models. my view is that any mistake by the model costs me way more than the premium, so i'd rather stay on the cutting edge than try to optimize for tokens.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;context management can be annoying. when clawdbot is browsing sites or doing research, context occasionally fills up and gets compacted (older conversation history gets deleted to make room). this always seems to happen at the worst time—right when i'm deep into something and have built up momentum. a frustrating "ugh, i guess this really is just a word predictor" moment. to avoid this i'm constantly starting new sessions, which i wish clawdbot would do for me.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;clawdbot doesn't know when to give up. its determination is usually a strength, but it lacks the human circuit breaker of "am i trying too hard here?" and sometimes burns through a lot of time/tokens on something a human would have abandoned.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tractor&lt;/head&gt;Mon 19 January 2026&lt;p&gt;Tagged: cad, metalwork&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electric tractor is finished! I have been working on this on and off for about 6 months. It is a toy for children (and me) to drive around the garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building the tractor has been fun for both me and Lucy. On many occasions she has asked "can we go and work on the tractor? right now?" and the two of us would go out to the garage and tinker with whatever was in progress at the time. Often she would get bored and go back in the house quite quickly, but that's par for the course for a 3-year-old. With any luck some of the philosophy of creation will rub off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Specs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tractor is powered by a 350W brushed DC motor with a 36v Li-ion ebike battery. You may be thinking that 350 watts doesn't sound very powerful, and you're right. It is a toy for children to drive around the garden, being slow is a feature not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rear axle is solid, meaning the two rear wheels always turn together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front axle pivots around a pin in the centre, which keeps all 4 wheels on the ground when driving over uneven terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a cable-operated disc brake on the rear axle which is very ineffective, but slightly better than not having a brake at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seat position is adjustable, so that adults can just about squeeze on to it and toddlers can just about reach the pedals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the tractor has very poor handling characteristics if you're an adult, because all of your weight is over the solid rear axle and the rear tyres have much more grip than the front, so you have to lean forwards to make it steer. For a while I had one of the rear wheels free-wheeling, which makes it steer better, but means it sometimes gets stuck on hills where you can't drive forwards, you can only wheelie to the side, which on balance is worse. I expect it's not as bad for small children because they're a.) not as heavy, and b.) sitting further forwards anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chassis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the chassis is a plywood box which is open at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this picture you can see the pin that the front axle pivots on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you can see the pencil lines that roughly show the limits of motion of the lower edge of the axle beam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the front wheels are for a sack truck, this sort of thing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are very cheap, a pair of wheels with tyres and hubs and bearings (brand new) on eBay is only Â£12 including postage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Steering&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to copy the steering arrangement from a Ferguson TE20, which originally was my reference design for the canonical tractor, although I obviously went over to the dark side with the colour scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TE20 steering wheel goes down to a gearbox quite near the driver, a shaft comes out each side, one turning clockwise and the other anticlockwise (as viewed from one fixed reference side), an arm off each shaft holds one end of a track rod, and the other end of the track rod is connected to an arm on the stub axle kingpin thing. Highlighted in red here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To replicate this I made a steering gearbox using angle grinder gears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The yellow one is a test print - the final one is in black Polymaker PC-Max material with heavy wall thickness and lots of infill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angle grinder gears are available cheaply and are a good way to buy high-quality bevel gears in about a 3:1 ratio, if you don't need them to be particularly heavy duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One issue with my steering gearbox is that there is no way to install it in the chassis because the shafts stick out the sides. This was an oversight, in CAD there is no difficulty. The solution is to assemble the parts in place inside the chassis. This is inconvenient in the extreme and if I were to do it again I would try to make it removable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arms that mount on the shafts are made of 3mm thick mild steel flat bar, bent around a rod, and then drilled for a mounting hole for the rod end, and drilled and cut to make a split-clamp for the steering shaft and kingpin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is effective and relatively easy to make, doesn't even require any machining, I'd do this again. The only drawback is that there's not a convenient way to key it to the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally I was planning to figure out a way to key it to the shaft after I had got the steering geometry sorted out, and therefore after I knew the angle that it wanted to be keyed at, but I have since realised that having these joints able to slip in the event of a crash is an "engineered failure" that prevents destroying the plastic gearbox. So I'm leaving it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made the steering wheel myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It consists of 2 CNC aluminium parts, one is just a ring, and the other is the 3-pronged part for the centre of the wheel. The 3-pronged part is then bent so that the prongs sit at the right diameter, and then the 3d-printed grips are added each side, with a bolt on each prong holding the whole stack together. It is relatively flimsy, I probably wouldn't do it this way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rear axle&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rear wheels are ride-on lawnmower rear wheels. They fit a 19mm axle, which annoyingly is not a size that I was able to buy cheap pillow block bearings for. In hindsight, maybe they actually fit a 3/4" axle and it would have been easy? In any case, I don't want to deliberately construct objects with imperial measurements, that's just trouble for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So instead I went with a 20mm axle, and 20mm pillow block bearings, but turned the ends down to 19mm to suit the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought this would be easy because I was labouring under the misapprehension that a 20mm shaft would fit through the spindle bore on my mini lathe. It does not! It's very close, but it doesn't fit. Possibly you could bore out the spindle bore slightly so that it would fit, but I didn't think of that at the time, and probably it is hardened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it can't go through the spindle bore. And the axle is too long to support the loose end with the tailstock on my lathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my solution was to support the loose end with a plastic bush in a piece of wood clamped in the vice, and kick the tail end of the lathe around to square it up until it's not turning a taper. This actually worked very well and I ended up with a taper going from 18.94mm to 18.97mm over 150mm length, which for all I know is as parallel as I turn anything at the best of times. See this video clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the only part I can't turn down to 19mm is the tiny bit at the headstock end which is clamped in the collet, which I filed down to match the 19mm diameter after I was finished with the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rear wheels have 2 flats in their bores to key them to the axle. I machined matching flats on the axle with my homemade CNC machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wheels are kept from sliding off the axle by split pins, one just outside each wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the axle also has carriers for the sprocket and the brake disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I originally mounted both of these by making an M6 tapped cross-drilled hole in the axle, and making a hub with a 6mm cross-drilled hole through it, and then bolting the hub to the axle. This provides both axial location and torque transmission so I thought it was a simple and effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the head of the bolt fixing the sprocket carrier to the axle in this pic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately fixing a hub to the axle with a single bolt through a hole is not adequate because the shear force is very large. Eventually the bolt holding the sprocket on snapped. I replaced it with a new bolt and it snapped again, so then I welded the carrier to the axle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hasn't snapped yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Countershaft&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally I thought it would work if the motor drove the rear axle with just a chain and sprockets, but I had missed out a factor of Pi in my calculation. Having the motor drive the rear axle requires about a 30:1 reduction, which is far too extreme, would require a rear sprocket with about 300 teeth. So I added a countershaft to gain back the factor of ~3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the countershaft in this pic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is supported by a couple of small pillow block bearings on a big piece of steel box section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shaft is simply an M12 bolt. The large sprocket is bolted to a big piece of aluminium, which is keyed to the bolt with a hexagon machined into the centre, which the bolt head is hammered into. And the small sprocket has a couple of flats on it, rather like the rear wheels, and I filed matching flats onto the threads at the end of the bolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reverse&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motor controller that I got doesn't have a way to reverse the motor, so I implemented reverse by putting an "on-off-on" DPDT switch in the wires that go to the motor, so that in one position positive and negative connect to the motor one way, in the middle position it's disconnected, and in the third position the polarity is reversed. This works fine but you need to make sure your switch can handle the current. In my case it's not too hard because 350W at 36V is only 10 amps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the switch sticking up from underneath the chassis here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(It has a black rubbery cover).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I later added a lever so that it is easier to switch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lever has no actual bearings, it just rides in holes drilled in the wood. This is more than adequate for the kind of speeds and loads that a gear lever experiences, which are basically zero. The holes just need to constrain its location. A bonus is that the natural friction in the holes prevents the lever from rattling around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did add a gate to indicate the selection, and constrain the movement to prevent damaging the switch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text is done with multicolour printing on the Bambu X1 Carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Brake&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the brake is from a mini moto. It doesn't work very well and I haven't done a very good job of fitting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much see how it works in this pic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pedal on the left-hand side (right-hand side in pic) pulls on the cable, which then pulls on the lever on the caliper, which presses the pads against the disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the gear lever, the shaft is not on any sort of bearing, it just pivots in holes drilled in the wood. I think this is also fine for the brake, because it doesn't get much use, although the force on the brake pedal is much higher than on the gear lever. If the pivots do get worn out then they can easily be drilled out and bushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonnet&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put off making the bonnet for a good while because I originally wanted to do something like a Ferguson TE20 bonnet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I couldn't work out how to do all the curves. My best plan was to break up the design into large flat surfaces and small curved surfaces, and make the large flat parts out of plywood and 3d print the small curved parts and somehow join them together and body-fill over the crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Lucy acquired this toy tractor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I saw that there is no need for the complex compound curves. Just a single curve will do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I tried to form the curved part with "kerf bending", but:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It instantly snapped instead of bending. I think I had the grain in the outer layer of plywood running in the wrong direction. It might have bent nicely if it was the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In for a penny, in for a pound, I carried on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And actually that was starting to look like I might get away with it. So I filled the gaps with glue to make it hold its shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after a few rounds of body-filling and sanding, I was actually really pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Throttle conditioner&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throttle response is very dissatisfying. It starts off from a standstill with quite a violent kick and then immediately tapers off into having hardly any power at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the plan was to make an Arduino project that would take the throttle position as input and output a "conditioned" throttle position as output, which would ramp up gradually as you initially apply the throttle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The throttle conditioner is in the yellow box here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it did work, it also somehow prevented the throttle from ever reaching 100%. The throttle position is transmitted as an analogue signal, and I think the analogue output of the Arduino topped out at a lower voltage than 100% throttle. I didn't care to fix it, and I realised that this was an unnecessary complexity, so I just removed the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I even had a magnet and sensor to detect when it was changed between forwards and reverse so that it would instantly cut the throttle when you change direction to avoid damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is not the way. A machine should obey the will of its operator, not its constructor, and it is incumbent on the operator not to operate in a way that damages the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Painting&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I despise painting. It is one of those jobs that takes way longer than it feels like it ought to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1: disassemble the completed tractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2: brush paint white "knot-block" primer onto the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 3: spray grey primer on everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4: draw the rest of the owl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Welding&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a long time since I did a lot of welding, and my welds on this tractor are rather poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have experimented with the welder today and discovered that my prior mental model about how the welder works was totally wrong. I had thought that turning up the voltage would make it "hotter", and turning up the wire speed would make it "build up more material". As if it's a 3d printer extruder and voltage sets temperature and wire speed sets extrusion feed rate. But that's not how it works at all! In fact turning up the wire speed makes it hotter, and turning down the voltage makes it build up more material. I don't really understand the physics of why that is the case, but at least I know how to control the machine now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like my blog, please consider subscribing to the RSS feed or the mailing list:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Claude is a space to think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The nature of AI conversations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incentive structures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting commerce&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A trusted tool for thought&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think Claude should work the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

In its standard form, self-attention incurs costs that increase with context length, driving demand for storage, compute, and energy that is now outstripping society's ability to provide them. To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible. We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness. Our work enables unbounded token generation at modest fixed cost, substantially reducing the infrastructure and energy demands of large-scale Transformer models. The mathematical techniques we introduce are of independent interest.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A case study in PDF forensics: The Epstein PDFs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 22, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 22, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Peter Wyatt, PDF Association&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent release of a tranche of files by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) under the “Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R.4405)” has once again prompted many people to closely examine redacted and sanitized PDF documents. Our previous articles on the Manafort papers and the Mueller report, as well as a study by Adhatarao, S. and Lauradoux, C. (2021) “Exploitation and Sanitization of Hidden Data in PDF Files: Do Security Agencies Sanitize Their PDF files?,” in Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security, illustrate the importance of robust sanitization and redaction workflows when handling sensitive documents prior to release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article examines a small random selection of the Epstein PDF files from a purely digital forensic perspective, focusing on the PDF syntax and idioms they contain, any malformations or unusual constructs, and other technical aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDFs are more challenging to analyze than many other formats because they are binary files that require specialized knowledge, expertise, and software. Please note that we did not analyze the contents of the PDF documents. Not every PDF was examined. Any mention of products (or appearance in screen-shots) does not imply any endorsement or support of any information, products, or providers whatsoever. We are not lawyers; this article does not constitute legal advice&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer this information, in part, as some of the Epstein PDFs released by DoJ are beginning to appear on malware analysis sites (such as Hybrid-Analysis) with various kinds of incorrect analysis and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;26 December 2025 update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After we'd completed our analysis the DoJ released a new dataset, DataSet 8.zip. This new ZIP file is 9.95 GB compressed and contains over 11,000 files, including 10,593 new PDFs totaling 1.8 GB and 29,343 pages (the longest document has 1,060 pages). DataSet 8 also contains many large MP4 movies, Excel spreadsheets, and various other files. The first PDF in the set of 10,593 PDFs is VOL00008\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009676.pdf, and the last file is VOL00008\IMAGES\0011\EFTA00039023.pdf. A cursory analysis shows pdfinfo properties similar to those from the earlier datasets, but we have not otherwise analyzed this new dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since our original post, various social media and news platforms have also been announcing “recoverable redactions” from the “Epstein Files”. We stand by our analysis; DoJ has correctly redacted the EFTA PDFs in Datasets 01-07, and they do not contain recoverable text as alleged. As our article states, we did not analyze any other DoJ or Epstein-related documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the featured image in this Guardian news article (which was also picked up by the New York Times) corresponds to VOL00004\IMAGES\0001EFTA00005855.pdf, as can be easily determined by searching for the Bates Numbers in the EFTA “.OPT” data files. The information in this EFTA PDF is fully and correctly redacted; there is no hidden information. The only extractable text is some garbled text from the poor-quality OCR and, as expected, the Bates Numbers on each page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the few reports we investigated (including from Forbes and Ed Krassenstein on both X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram), these stories misrepresent other DoJ files that were not part of the major DataSets 01-07 release on December 19 under the EFTA. All PDFs released under EFTA have a Bates Number on every page starting "EFTA". These include “Case 1:22-cv-10904-JSR Document 1-1, Exhibit 1 to Government’s Complaint against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.” (see page 41) and “Case No: ST-20-CV-14 Government Exhibit 1” (see page 19). These PDFs, previously released by the DoJ, do contain incorrect and ineffective redactions, with black boxes that simply obscure text, making “copy &amp;amp; paste” easy to recover the text that's otherwise hidden. Clearly, DoJ processes and systems in the past have inadequately redacted information!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The files we examined&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tranche released by DoJ on Friday, December 19 is available as seven “data sets”, most easily downloaded as seven ZIP archives totaling just under 2.97 GB. Each ZIP file contains a similar folder structure, with DataSet 6 being the odd one out with an extra top-level folder. Once unzipped, the total size is 2.99 GB. The tranche contains 4,085 PDF files, a single AVI (movie) file (located in the folder VOL00002\NATIVES\0001), and 2 data files (.DAT and .OPT) for each ZIP archive. The “.OPT” files appear to be CSV (Comma-Separated Values) but lack a heading row, while the “.DAT” files contain information about the Bates numbering. The analysis we provide here is limited to the PDF files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PDF files are named and ordered sequentially within the folder structure, starting with “EFTA00000001.pdf” in VOL00001 and ending with “EFTA00009664.pdf” in VOL00007, indicating that at least 5,879 PDF files remain unreleased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A random sampling of the PDFs for visual review suggests that they are a mix of single and multi-page full-page photos and scanned content. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was used to provide some searchable and extractable text in at least some files. “Black box” style redactions (without text reasons) are apparent. When done correctly, this is the appropriate way to redact, far more robust than pixelating text. The PDFs we sampled did not include any obviously “born digital” documents. Various news sites are reporting very heavily redacted documents within this tranche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;File validity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A precursor to most forensic examinations is to establish whether the PDF files are technically valid (that is, conform to the rules of the PDF format), since analyzing malformed files can easily lead to incorrect results or wrong conclusions. Combining tools that use different methods provides the broadest possible information while ensuring that tooling limitations are fully understood. However, if the basic file structure or cross-reference information is incorrect, various software might then draw different conclusions and/or construct different Document Object Models (DOMs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to basic file structure, incremental updates (if any), and cross-reference information, PDF validity assessments include the objects that comprise the PDF’sDOM as well as the file structure, incremental updates, and cross-reference information. To assess relationships between objects in the PDF DOM, some forensic analysis tools leverage our Arlington PDF Data Model, while others use their own internal methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of file validity, using a multitude of PDF forensic tools, identified only one minor defect (invalidity); 109 PDFs had a positive FontDescriptor Descent value rather than a negative one. This is a relatively common (but minor) error, typically associated with font substitution and font matching, that does not affect the validity of the files overall. One specific forensic tool reported a PDF version issue with some files, related to the document catalog Version entry, which prevented the tool from further verifying those specific PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PDF versions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve previously written about the unreliability of PDF version numbers. Still, for forensic purposes, they may provide insight into the DoJ’s software, and whether improved software could have performed better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used two different but commonly used PDF command-line &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt; utilities on different platforms (Windows and Ubuntu Linux) to summarize information about these PDF files. When run against the full tranche of PDFs, I got two very different sets of answers! Immediately, my spidey senses started to tingle, and I was once again reminded of a key lesson in digital document forensics – you should never trust a single tool!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reported PDF Version&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Count Tool A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Count Tool B&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;209&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,817&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,875&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;267&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TOTAL (should be 4,085)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,085&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,085&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PDF version in the file header, “&lt;code&gt;%PDF-x.y&lt;/code&gt;”, is nominally the first line in every PDF file (based on the not-unreasonable assumption that the PDF files have no “junk bytes” before this PDF file identifier). Using the Linux command line, you can run in Linux “&lt;code&gt;head -n 1 file.pdf&lt;/code&gt;” to extract the first header line from each PDF and compare it with the reported results from each tool. Or run in Linux “&lt;code&gt;grep -P --text --byte-offset "%PDF-\d\.\d" *.pdf&lt;/code&gt;” to confirm that there are no junk bytes prior to the PDF header line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for the difference reported in the table above is that Tool B is not accounting for the Version entry in the document catalog of PDFs with incremental updates. We’ll next investigate whether this is due to malformed files or a programming error. When properly accounting for incremental updates, however, Tool A is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the same &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt; output (and again comparing results from both tools), we can also quickly establish the following facts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is tagged&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is “optimized” (technically, Linearized PDF)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF has any annotations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF has any outlines (bookmarks)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF contains any embedded files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;None of the PDFs are forms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;None of the PDFs contains JavaScript&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Page counts range from 1 (in 3,818 PDFs) to 119 pages (in two PDFs), totaling 9,659 pages across all 4,085 PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incremental updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDF’s incremental updates feature allows multiple revisions of a document to be stored in a PDF file. As the name implies, each set of deltas is appended to the original document, forming a chain of edits. When read by conforming PDF software, a PDF is always processed from the end of the file, effectively applying the deltas to the original document and to any previous incremental updates. Both the original document and each incremental update can be recognized by their respective “&lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;” and “&lt;code&gt;%%EOF&lt;/code&gt;” markers (assuming that the PDF files are structured correctly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this investigation, we started by examining the very first PDF in the tranche: VOL00001\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00000001.pdf. This PDF had different PDF versions reported by different versions of &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt;. A simple trick to check if a PDF contains incremental updates is to search for these special markers while treating the PDF as a text file (which it isn’t!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ grep -P --text -–byte-offset "(xref)|(%%EOF)" EFTA00000001.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;371340:xref&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; 371758:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 371775:%%EOF&lt;lb/&gt; 372977:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 372994:%%EOF&lt;lb/&gt; 373961:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 373978:%%EOF&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results (sorted by byte offset) indicate that EFTA00000001.pdf contains two incremental updates after the original file. The lack of an “&lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;” marker before the last two “&lt;code&gt;startxref&lt;/code&gt;” markers indicate that neither incremental updates uses conventional cross-reference data, but may use cross-reference streams (if any objects are changed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bates numbering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As referenced above, Bates numbering is the process by which every page is assigned a unique identifier. For this tranche of Epstein PDF files, Bates numbers were added to each page via a separate incremental update, as shown below in Visual Studio Code with my pdf-cos-syntax extension. Note that DoJ’s PDFs are primarily text-based internally, making forensic analysis a lot easier - and the files a lot bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2984 is the end-of-file marker for the file version, and line 2985 starts a new incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2985-2987 define object 26, the unembedded Helvetica font resource used by the Bates number.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2997-3020 are the modified page object (object 3), replacing the page object in previous revisions of the file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2999 is the page Contents array, comprising five separate content streams, with the 3rd stream (object 29) being the Bates numbering added in this incremental update. Object 30 is an empty content stream that could have been removed by an optimization process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 3034 sets the Helvetica font to 12 point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 3037 uses a hexadecimal string to paint the Bates number onto the page.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idiom for this final incremental update, which adds the Bates number to every page, appears in all the PDF files we selected at random for investigation. This specific incremental update always uses a cross-reference stream (&lt;code&gt;/Type /XRef&lt;/code&gt;) and relies on the previous incremental update, in which the document catalog Version entry is set to PDF 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first incremental update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VSCode pdf-cos-syntax extension also indicates (correctly!) that the original PDF is missing the required (when the PDF contains binary data, which most do) comment as the second line of the file that indicates to software that the PDF file needs to be treated as binary data (ISO 32000-2:2020, §7.5.2). Although the missing comment does not make the PDF invalid per se, without such a marker close to the top of each PDF, software may think the PDF is a text file, and thus potentially corrupt the PDF by changing line endings, which would break the byte offsets in the cross-reference data. In this PDF, the first incremental update adds this marker comment after a lot of binary data, which is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the first incremental update changed the document catalog Version entry to PDF 1.5, as we see in this next screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2953-2984 are the incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2954 is a PDF comment. PDF comments always start with a PERCENT SIGN (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) and may occur in many places in PDF files. Effective sanitization and redaction workflows typically remove all comments from PDFs because they may inadvertently disclose information, but this exact comment appears in 3,608 other PDF files. The origin or meaning of this comment was not further investigated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2964 upgrades the PDF version to 1.5. At first glance, this may appear to be perfectly valid PDF, but it is technically incorrect because the file header is &lt;code&gt;%PDF-1.3&lt;/code&gt;yet the Version key was only added in PDF 1.4 - this is what the strict file validation tool mentioned above had noticed. As object 24 is a compressed object stream (lines 2966-2973) and object 25 is a compressed cross-reference stream (lines 2974-2981), the indicated version should be PDF 1.5. As a practical matter, however, this level of technical detail does not impact operation or behavior of PDFs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2984 is the end-of-section “&lt;code&gt;%%EOF&lt;/code&gt;” marker for this incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this section of the PDF uses compressed object streams, specialized PDF forensic tools must be used… simple search methodologies, such as those mentioned above, may not identify everything!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that there are 7 objects (because we find /&lt;code&gt;N 7&lt;/code&gt;) inside the object stream:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As per PDF’s specification, ISO 32000-2:2020, §7.5.7, the first line of integers is interpreted as N pairs, where the first integer is the object number and the second integer is the byte offset relative to the first object in the object stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1st integer (object number)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2nd integer (start offset)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Explanation&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Content&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;23&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;472&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Array of 2 indirect references (to content streams)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[21 0 R 4 0 R]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;486&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Updated Page object&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is very interesting here – from a PDF forensics perspective – is the fact of a hidden document information dictionary that is not referenced from the last (final) incremental update trailer (i.e., there is no Info entry in object 31, lines 3050-3063 below). As such, this orphaned dictionary is invisible to PDF software! This oddity occurs in all other PDFs we’d randomly selected for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formatted nicely as an uncompressed object, this hidden document information dictionary inside the compressed object stream contains the following information (the CreationDate and ModDate appear to change in other randomly examined PDFs):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;17 0 obj &amp;lt;&amp;lt; /CreationDate (D:20251218143205) /ModDate (D:20251218143205) /Creator (OmniPage CSDK 21.1) /Producer (Processing-CLI) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; endobj&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This metadata clearly indicates the software DoJ used to manipulate these PDF files. Although not relevant to the content, this forensic discovery clearly shows that extra care is required when sanitizing PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Different incremental updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another randomly selected PDF, VOL00003\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00003939.pdf contains 3 full-page images, and just a single incremental update that applies the Bates numbering. However, in this case the file header is &lt;code&gt;%PDF-1.5&lt;/code&gt; yet both the original PDF and incremental update use conventional cross-reference tables! This isn’t problematic, but is certainly unexpected and inefficient since PDF 1.5 introduced compressed cross-reference streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By comparing the objects in the incremental cross-reference table to the original cross-reference table we can see that objects 66 to 69 – the 3 Page objects for the 3 page document – were redefined. This is just what is expected in order to add the Bates number to each page’s Contents stream as in the previous example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Metadata&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial examination using pdfinfo utilities did not identify any metadata in any of the PDFs in the tranche, either in the document information dictionary (PDF file trailer Info entry) or as an XMP metadata stream (Metadata entry).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, since we know that (a) the tranche includes PDFs with incremental updates, and (b) that an orphaned document information dictionary exists, all revisions of a document should be thoroughly examined. Incremental updates may have marked other document information dictionaries or XMP metadata streams as free but not deleted the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XMP metadata is always encoded in PDF as a stream object, and since stream objects cannot be in compressed object streams, using forensic tools to search for keys “&lt;code&gt;/XML&lt;/code&gt;” or “&lt;code&gt;/Metadata&lt;/code&gt;” should always locate them. All modern office suites and PDF creation applications will generate XMP metadata when exporting to PDF. As XMP is usually uncompressed, searching for XML fragments may also be helpful (see below for an example XMP object fragment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;3 0 obj &amp;lt;&amp;lt;/Length 36996/Subtype/XML/Type/Metadata&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stream &amp;lt;?xpacket begin="ï»¿" id="W5M0MpCe … zNTczkc9d"?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/" x:xmptk=" … "&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xmp="http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/" ...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not unsurprisingly for properly-redacted files, we did not find any XMP metadata streams or XML in any PDF. As a consequence, none of the PDFs can declare conformance to either PDF/A (ISO 19005 for long-term archiving) or PDF/UA (ISO 14289 for accessibility). Of course, as untagged PDFs, the files cannot conform to accessibility specifications such as PDF/UA or WCAG in any event. Additionally, none of the PDFs appear to include device-independent color spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The presence of an Info entry in the trailer dictionary or (in PDFs with cross-reference streams) in the cross-reference stream dictionary indicates the presence of document information dictionaries. “&lt;code&gt;/Info&lt;/code&gt;” does indeed occur in many of the PDFs, including multiple times in some PDFs, indicating potential changes via incremental updates. However, as discovered above, in some cases the final incremental update does not include an Info entry, thus “orphaning” any existing document information dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISO 32000-2:2020, Table 349 lists the defined entries in PDF’s document information dictionary (Title, Author, Subject, etc). Any vendor may add additional entries (such as Apple does with its /AAPL:Keywords entry), so redaction and sanitization software should be aware of extra entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From our random sampling, we identified one PDF with a non-trivial document information dictionary still present: VOL00002\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00003212.pdf. This is shown below in Visual Studio Code with my pdf-cos-syntax extension:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of additional interest in this specific PDF is that the comment at line 60 has survived DoJ’s sanitization and redaction workflow! Other PDF comments may therefore also be present in other files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EFTA00003212.pdf appears to be a redacted image or an error from the DoJ workflow, as it is a single page with the text “No Images Produced”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple searching of the standardized PDF document information dictionary entries gives the following (note that the technique used will not locate information in compressed object streams, as mentioned above):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;APPL:Keywords&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Date analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detailed date analysis is a common task in the forensic analysis of potentially fraudulent or modified documents. However, in the case of redacted or sanitized documents, where the document is known to have been modified, this can be less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The creation and modification dates for the 3,609 PDFs range from December 18, 2025, 14:32:05 (2:32 pm) to December 19, 2025, 23:26:13 (almost midnight). For all files, the creation and modification dates are always the same. This may also imply that the DoJ batch processing to prepare this tranche of PDFs took at least 36 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s also interesting is that the CreationDate and ModDate fields in the hidden document information dictionary (inside the object stream of the first increment update – see above) appear to always be an exact match to both the CreationDate and ModDate of the original document. This implies that all dates across all incremental updates were updated in a single processing pass that applied the Bates numbering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Photographs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no JPEG images (DCTDecode filter) in any PDF in the tranche, including the full-page photographs. Randomly viewing the photographic images at high magnification (zoom) in PDF viewers clearly shows JPEG “jaggy” compression artifacts. All photographic images appear to have been downscaled to 96 DPI (769 x 1152 or 1152 x 769 pixels), making text on random objects in the photos much harder to discern (see the OCR discussion below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DoJ explicitly avoids JPEG images in the PDFs probably because they appreciate that JPEGs often contain identifiable information, such as EXIF, IPTC, or XMP metadata, as well as COM (comment) tags in the JPEG bitstream. This information may disclose the camera model and serial number, GPS location, camera operator details, date/time of the photo, etc., and is more difficult to redact while retaining the JPEG data. The DoJ processing pipeline has therefore explicitly converted all lossy JPEG images to low DPI, FLATE-encoded bitmaps in the PDFs using an indexed device-dependent color space with a palette of 256 unique colors (which reduces the color fidelity compared to the original high-quality digital color photograph).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scanned documents – or are they?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Randomly inspecting the tranche discovers many documents that appear to have been created by a scanning process. On closer inspection, there are documents that have tell-tale artifacts from a physical scanning process, such as visible physical paper edges, punched holes, staple marks, spiral binding, stamps, paper scuff marks, color blotches and inconsistencies, handwritten notes or marginalia, varying paper skew, and platen marks from the physical paper scanning processes. For example, VOL00007\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009440.pdf shows many of these aspects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also other documents that appear to simulate a scanned document but completely lack the “real-world noise” expected with physical paper-based workflows. The much crisper images appear almost perfect without random artifacts or background noise, and with the exact same amount of image skew across multiple pages. Thanks to the borders around each page of text, page skew can easily be measured, such as with VOL00007\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009229.pdf. It is highly likely these PDFs were created by rendering original content (from a digital document) to an image (e.g., via print to image or save to image functionality) and then applying image processing such as skew, downscaling, and color reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of the timeless monospaced (also known as fixed-width) “Courier” typeface means that the number of characters redacted can be easily determined by vertical alignment with text lines above and below each redaction. In some instances, this may reduce the possible number of options that represent the redacted content, allowing it to be more easily guessed. Although redaction of variable-width typefaces is far more complex, Bland, M., Iyer, A., and Levchenko, K. 2022 paper “Story Beyond the Eye: Glyph Positions Break PDF Text Redaction” showed that this is still possible with sufficient computing power and determination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optical Character Recognition (OCR)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCR is complex image processing that attempts to identify text in bitmap images. In PDF files, OCR-identified text is commonly placed on top of the image using the invisible text render mode. This enables users to then extract the text from the image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Returning to the very first PDF file in the tranche, VOL00001\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00000001.pdf - this is a full-page photo of a hand-written sign where part of the hand-written information is explicitly redacted. The PDF contains largely inaccurate OCR-ed text, indicating that natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), or even language aware dictionary-based algorithms were not used. This means that there will be more errors in the extracted text than is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With cloud platforms readily accessible and supporting advanced OCR at low cost, anyone is capable of re-processing the entire tranche of PDFs and comparing the OCR results to those provided by DoJ. Even though the page images are low-resolution (96 DPI), rerunning OCR may bring to light additional or corrected information hidden by the original OCR that failed to recognize everything correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “black box” redactions we investigated were all correctly applied directly into the image pixel data. They are not separate PDF rectangle objects simply floating above sensitive information that was still present in the image and easily discoverable. Yes, sometimes it is that easy…!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did not set out to comprehensively analyze every corner of every PDF file in the Epstein PDFs, but to present a basic walk-through of some of the challenges and tricks used to conduct a PDF forensic assessment. Our results above were from a small random sample of documents - there may well be outlier PDFs in the data sets that we did not encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DoJ has clearly created internal processes, systems, and workflows that can sanitize and redact information prior to publishing as PDF. This includes converting JPEG images to low-resolution pixel-only bitmaps, largely removing metadata, and rendering page images to bitmaps. OCR appears to have been widely applied, but is of variable quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their PDF technology could be improved to vastly reduce file size by removing unnecessary objects (e.g., empty content streams, ProcSets, empty thumbnail references, etc.), simplifying and reducing content streams, applying all incremental updates (i.e., removing all incremental update sections), and always using compressed object streams and compressed cross-reference streams. Information leakage may also be occurring via PDF comments or orphaned objects inside compressed object streams, as I discovered above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDF forensics is a highly complex field, where variations in files and tool assumptions can easily yield false results. The PDF Association hosts a PDF Forensic Liaison Working Group to develop industry guidance on forensic examination of PDF files and to educate document examiners and other specialists about many of these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Voxtral transcribes &lt;lb/&gt; at the speed of sound.&lt;/head&gt;Try Voxtral Transcribe 2 in Mistral Studio&lt;p&gt; Precision diarization, real-time&lt;lb/&gt; transcription, and a new audio playground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we're releasing Voxtral Transcribe 2, two next-generation speech-to-text models with state-of-the-art transcription quality, diarization, and ultra-low latency. The family includes Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 for batch transcription and Voxtral Realtime for live applications. Voxtral Realtime is open-weights under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're also launching an audio playground in Mistral Studio to test transcription instantly, powered by Voxtral Transcribe 2, with diarization and timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2: State-of-the-art transcription with speaker diarization, context biasing, and word-level timestamps in 13 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Realtime: Purpose-built for live transcription with latency configurable down to sub-200ms, enabling voice agents and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best-in-class efficiency: Industry-leading accuracy at a fraction of the cost, with Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 achieving the lowest word error rate, at the lowest price point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open weights: Voxtral Realtime ships under Apache 2.0, deployable on edge for privacy-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Voxtral Realtime.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Realtime is purpose-built for applications where latency matters. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models by processing audio in chunks, Realtime uses a novel streaming architecture that transcribes audio as it arrives. The model delivers transcriptions with delay configurable down to sub-200ms, unlocking a new class of voice-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word error rate (lower is better) across languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 2.4 seconds delay, ideal for subtitling, Realtime matches Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2, our latest batch model. At 480ms delay, it stays within 1-2% word error rate, enabling voice agents with near-offline accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is natively multilingual, achieving strong transcription performance in 13 languages, including English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, and Dutch. With a 4B parameter footprint, it runs efficiently on edge devices, ensuring privacy and security for sensitive deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re releasing the model weights under Apache 2.0 on the Hugging Face Hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average diarization error rate (lower is better) across five English benchmarks (Switchboard, CallHome, AMI-IHM, AMI-SDM, SBCSAE) and the TalkBank multilingual benchmark (German, Spanish, English, Chinese, Japanese).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average word error rate (lower is better) across the top-10 languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 delivers significant improvements in transcription and diarization quality across languages and domains. At approximately 4% word error rate on FLEURS and $0.003/min, Voxtral offers the best price-performance of any transcription API. It outperforms GPT-4o mini Transcribe, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Assembly Universal, and Deepgram Nova on accuracy, and processes audio approximately 3x faster than ElevenLabs’ Scribe v2 while matching on quality at one-fifth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enterprise-ready features.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 introduces key capabilities for enterprise deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Speaker diarization.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate transcriptions with speaker labels and precise start/end times. Ideal for meeting transcription, interview analysis, and multi-party call processing. Note: with overlapping speech, the model typically transcribes one speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Context biasing.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide up to 100 words or phrases to guide the model toward correct spellings of names, technical terms, or domain-specific vocabulary. Particularly useful for proper nouns or industry terminology that standard models often miss. Context biasing is optimized for English; support for other languages is experimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Word-level timestamps.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate precise start and end timestamps for each word, enabling applications like subtitle generation, audio search, and content alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Expanded language support.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Realtime, this model now supports 13 languages: English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, and Dutch. Non-English performance significantly outpaces competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Noise robustness.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintains transcription accuracy in challenging acoustic environments, such as factory floors, busy call centers, and field recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Longer audio support.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Process recordings up to 3 hours in a single request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word error rate (lower is better) across languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Audio playground.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test Voxtral Transcribe 2 directly in Mistral Studio. Upload up to 10 audio files, toggle diarization, choose timestamp granularity, and add context bias terms for domain-specific vocabulary. Supports .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .flac, .ogg up to 1GB each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Transforming voice applications.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral powers voice workflows in diverse applications and industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Meeting intelligence.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcribe multilingual recordings with speaker diarization that clearly attributes who said what and when. At Voxtral's price point, annotate large volumes of meeting content at industry-leading cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Voice agents and virtual assistants.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build conversational AI with sub-200ms transcription latency. Connect Voxtral Realtime to your LLM and TTS pipeline for responsive voice interfaces that feel natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contact center automation.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcribe calls in real time, enabling AI systems to analyze sentiment, suggest responses, and populate CRM fields while conversations are still happening. Speaker diarization ensures clear attribution between agents and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Media and broadcast.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate live multilingual subtitles with minimal latency. Context biasing handles proper nouns and technical terminology that trip up generic transcription services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compliance and documentation.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor and transcribe interactions for regulatory compliance, with diarization providing clear speaker attribution and timestamps enabling precise audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both models support GDPR and HIPAA-compliant deployments through secure on-premise or private cloud setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 is available now via API at $0.003 per minute.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Arcan-A12: Weaving a Different Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;26 Jan 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is a companion piece to “Arcan Explained: A browser for different Webs” which covered how Arcan works as a browser engine. Some key takeaways from that article are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The focus is only on running networked applications where the outermost one takes on the responsibilities of window management and display control, becoming the ‘desktop’.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Document browsing is a compilation step through separate tools that generates a signed, shareable application package.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is recursive (an application can embed others, including itself) and can compose and interact with allow-listed local software.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Media decoding, media transforms, network communication and system integration are all delegated to per-instance sets of interchangeable privilege-separated programs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is essentially a browser take on a microkernel architecture. The choice in network communication program will control resource retrieval, link resolution, discovery and so on. This determines what kind of a web you end up in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason why this is posted here and not on the main Arcan site is to emphasise this decoupling. It is but one possible solution, and there will be better ideas out there, without someone having to boil the ocean in order to try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article covers the design and choices of the included default implementation (&lt;code&gt;afsrv_net&lt;/code&gt;), its command-line helper tool
(&lt;code&gt;arcan-net&lt;/code&gt;) and how they leverage the A12 protocol to form
a web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is organised as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Recalling the old ways we take a trip down memory lane back to the days of bulletin board systems to look for good bits to bring back into style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In A frayed web of separate worlds we argue that the ‘World Wide Web’ is anything but ‘World Wide’ and cover a set of problems that we want our solution to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In A12 as protocol we go through the characteristics of the protocol that we are building the rest on top of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In A12 Web we layer in designs to address the problems of a frayed web using the A12 protocol, along with some properties we want it to have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in Developer Story we get practical and go through the use of the tools available to actually build something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recalling the old ways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My early access to the Internet started through Bulletin Board Systems, specifically ones that translated select Usenet discussion groups and relayed e-mail over a system called ‘Echomail’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If those words are unfamiliarly to you, a BBS was mainly someone sharing a slice of their computer to others over a telephone network. This was served to one or a few people at a time because each active connection required a designated telephone line and those were expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See also: The BBS documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the boards I frequented had a very personal feel to them. It was more like being allowed inside someone’s computing living room than being presented with a streamlined and well-dressed corporate facade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was at once both intimate and intimidating on the rare few occasions when the SysOp (“System Operator”) decided to “break into chat” and your browsing of the local wares was interrupted by a seemingly inescapable one-to-one chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding out about these places was an interesting journey in itself. Initial discovery was by word of mouth through a friend of a friend. As things sobered up, magazines took to providing listings. Here the experiences were on the milder side. There was less profanity and rarely mischief manuals (such as “the Anarchist’s Cookbook”), erotica or pirated software. Secondary discovery came through sitelists which the sysops curated themselves, or that someone had dumped into a shared upload directory or snuck into the ‘release information’ files packaged inside some piece of downloadable software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often enough a phone number did not actually lead to the board in question. Instead of the familiar tone of the modem connection handshake you got the voice of someone who did not appreciate being woken up at two in the morning – perhaps you had misread the operating hours/days (not everything was 24/7) or the sysop had grown tired of it all and closed the thing down. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this shallow description alone we can see the outline of some sort of troubled web story: Through word of mouth links between a named entry (Larry’s Land of Leisure and Suites thereof) and an address (here, phone-number) you could access resources, including links to other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as links go, they were not particularly good:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unidirectional - unless told, the one being linked to was unaware of who referred to them and thus had no say as to whether the extra attention was appreciated or not.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Non-descriptive - you had to try and resolve the link to figure out what it actually linked to, or if it was even valid in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Constraints as a side channel - “open between 08.00pm to 06.00am Fri-Sun” was something that might be mentioned on a login screen (less than helpful) or on the sitelist. Accuracy varied wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Local resources were not addressable - you could point someone in the general direction of something, but once they were connected to the board itself the true hunt began.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Local termination - resolving a link does not let you find further ones without processing the resources at the linked location.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ephemeral - should the address mapping change, there is no mechanism to rediscover the linked resource through other paths in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of this and more still apply to links on the world “wide” web. To their credit URLs did fix addressing local resources (for a time) and DNS did something about the ephemerality, only to be undone by shortening services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, think how much less useful even the first versions of HTML would have been without local resources being part of the language of the ‘link’. The technical solution is about as trivial as can be, yet the consequences are massive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a snack for thought, take the ‘local termination’ part: this is rather unusual if you think about the underlying data structure; it is a graph, but it is not exposed as such. A link may lead to other links, but first you need to ‘scrape’ (download, parse, extract) them from the outer resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This left a big discoverability hole to fill, one big enough to spawn some of the wealthiest companies in the world. It may be tempting to think how things would turn out if the other weaknesses had been addressed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obvious elephant in the room is Ted Nelson’s poetic Xanadu and how it keeps being brought up as the ‘what could have been’ solution because it used backlinks to avoid unidirectionality and transclusions for subcontent referencing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, the rest of its ‘web as living document’ story had a very niche appeal, and the browser part was vapourware for the longest time and then very quirky and unintuitive. As important as the linking story is for the base layer of a web, there also needs to be something there: content is king.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech doesn’t just go away, but rather move into one of many retirement homes for retrocomputing romantics. I don’t recall a strong inflection point where the BBS stopped being my primary source for information and exploration, it “just happened” as an uncoordinated silent shift. The Internet just naturally became the new default, but the transition and loss of something could be felt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real kicker was the shift in discovery, with search engines as the natural new starting point, some being Web while also somehow not being ‘Web’, like NTNU.no’s FTP search. They quickly became the way to discover content. More seasoned explorers, like the late and great +Fravia pivoted from using disassemblers and debuggers to reverse the dynamic structure of computing, to unpacking the search engine ‘command-line’ to reverse the structure of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other discovery solutions were curated collections of links as ‘portals’, like the original Yahoo. Those were similar to magazine sitelists, which also switched to providing links as URLs rather than phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might seem comical and distant now but there was real value in buying a computer magazine for suggestions on where to go on the web. Several Internet Service Providers at the time did go through the extra effort of bundling subscriptions to such magazines. Still even echoes of BBS form discovery remained for a while in the shape of ‘Web rings’ and IRC chatbots serving sitelists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To shorten the story somewhat I will skip past the evolution of forums into ‘community’ sites, how they were replaced by ‘social media’ and so on. Instead I will simply suggest that the ‘web’ oscillates between different modalities, like (open, distributed, public) to (closed, centralised, invite-only). The nudge needed to switch the trend from the one to the other, is spam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‘open web’ has, to me, become the least useful resource on the Internet, and that rapidly accelerated to large hadron levels with the sheer amount of bullshit synthesis that has weaseled its way in between me and whatever I was searching for or whoever I was communicating with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am anything but alone in feeling this disconnect. For a well worded view on the matter, look no further than Splitting the Web. That is, if your browser still allows you to, and the link is still working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A frayed web of separate worlds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that the many web pundits I have spoken to over the years have in common when asked to narrow down what the web ‘is’, is a certain glee over unity. Grab a (reasonable) device! And a browser! Browse the web! From anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t answer the question and does not match any reality of mine. I have reasonable devices in every form factor, and an even larger pile of completely unreasonable ones. I use several browsers, but it is an exceptional day if two browsers on two different devices behave even close to the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heck, if two browsers run on the same device but gets different geolocated source IPs they are served different content on the regular, and more so when using choice examples, say between China to Japan or whether the almighty Cloudflare deems you worthy or not. That is a rather narrow idea of ‘world-wide’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For every other click I am supposed to prove my humanity by clicking a box or waiting a few seconds while my computer crunch pointless numbers. Possibly both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where is it? Hardly in the protocol. Otherwise we could have dropped that part of the URL long ago. Even before shifts towards the likes of QUIC or TLS (or is it SSL?) becoming ubiquitous, browsers implemented a wide range of them, from Gopher and FTP to RTSP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also won’t find it in the myriad of document containers or the resources referenced inside. What once was ‘Flash’ or ‘Silverlight’ is now an exercise in computing necromancy to relive. Is that javascript of yours following ECMAScript.1997 or 2025?. One day you might get to see that PNG as JXL, if the Gods so decide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are not big on appealing to the authority of the W3C, what you are left with now are the links and how people use them. As we implied previously, the properties of ‘links’ and how they are discovered and enable discovery largely controls what kind of web that emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tangent striking dischord&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discord is an interesting phenomenon that deserves to be included here for a handful of reasons. I will fight the urge to attempt a larger breakdown, but it does serve as a connection to the BBS story from before, albeit in sheep’s clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the owners it is probably the happiest of little accidents, just like the Covid pandemic was to Slack. The numbers displayed on Wikipedia and friends are probably imaginary, but suggestions around 3 million accounts in 2016 to well over 500 million in 2025, and a little less than that actually active, seem reasonable. That is quite something for what was basically paratext and coordination around gaming – maybe the ‘Linux desktop’ could learn something from this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The connection to the BBS story is that it gives you a turnkey solution for spinning up your own ‘personal’ ‘server’. In reality it is anything but, merely a namespace where you only get to partially define a small set of the rules, but at least you get to pick an icon or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual agency is more like the old surveillance camera meme:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically it is completely uninspired. The browser story is Electron as a bodge patchset on top of some dull variant of Chromium. Somehow it is always my lucky day when launching as ‘pretend consent’ language to force you to update whatever to whatever just to then automatically download some more updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The linking story is somehow worse than plain web. First you have one form for local object link embedding. That one is unlikely to be externally content addressable URLs, thus not shareable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you have pseudo-resolution of regular URLs (into ‘previews’) that then gets forwarded to another browser, even though that is most likely the same code you were already running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its search story is spartan but also telling; a basic command-line with some magical prefixes with search space limited to that of the current ‘server’. I suspect it is very deliberately so before IPO, and that a possible sell later is both training data when all other wells have gone dry, and a chatbot interface to deliver masqueraded ads and bias to some; dark secrets to others, all based on what- and who- you are willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That something like the TOS violation Searchcord, managed to spark anger and controversy over basic search of partial indexing across public servers (that opted in!) is also telling of the average user expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content wise it is a hotspot for the usual uninteresting filth like grooming; violence; expressions of carnal desires; bullying and brigading. That is something of a variable to monitor as part of a larger health and sanity check. If it is completely absent I get suspicious. If it is overflowing, I walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, even though the presentation has all the personality of a wet fart captured in a bag and painted grey, it is my goto for some slim chance of an actual interaction with an actual person over a niche interest. That is not gaming paratext, but areas as diverse as CNC Machinery, Pinball Repair, Laser engraving, Electronics and Reverse Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My point is that even though the building blocks and overall purpose is wrong - a strong and playful human connection is still possible and can spring up in the most unlikely of places. We’ll need that going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A12 as protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to get technical and cover the last building block before also getting practical. The base A12 protocol was introduced here: A12: Visions of the fully networked desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It provides means for sharing an interactive media source (like an application window or composited desktop) to a sink in either a push based configuration, like how X11 remoting worked, or a pull one like VNC, RDP, or SSH would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is done over one of many transfer channels, each being unidirectional and coupling a possible video, audio and binary ‘blob’ stream corresponding to source windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The philosophy was that of ‘one desktop, many devices’. This means having individual devices be responsible for providing one or many sources over a network, and the desktop finding and composing them together as seamlessly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among its building blocks is the ability to redirect a source from one sink to another while it is still running. This was demonstrated already back in 2019 by ‘dragging a living window from one machine to another’ as seen in the clip below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also an optional extension to the protocol that enables previously paired sources and sinks to find each other again by broadcasting sets of challenge hashed public keys backed by petnames. This turns cryptographic identity into the link itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This avoids having to rely on DNS, DHCP provided hostnames, mDNS or other naming services for local (re-) discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is not enough for what we need here, and that brings us to the final extension. It introduces a third possible role, the directory. It act as a rendezvous for discovery; traffic relaying; NAT traversal; shared and private file/state store; application hosting and source/sink match-making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The directory server forms a messaging and storage namespace for each hosted application. By default this is broadcast between all sinks running an application. This works for light collaboration and coordination. The reference desktop environment for Arcan, Durden, uses this to synchronise clipboard and share input devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For something more refined we can slot in a directory server side control application to match. It uses the same structure as a regular Arcan application, but its role is to coordinate and regulate communication and to mediate access to other networked resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such resources can be those that are necessary to the dynamic side of the application itself, like hosted media, indexing and search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve that there are some special functions in the scripting API that we will return to in the ‘Developer Story’ section. Two of particular note are &lt;code&gt;link_target&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;reference_target&lt;/code&gt;. Those lets us define different kinds of
links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads us to the next section, as we can now form webs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A12 Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have reached the philosophy of ‘the desktop, reaching out’ similar to the BBS as covered in ‘the old ways’ to counter the problems from ‘a frayed web of separate worlds’ and either sizzle out into obscurity or create new terrifying problems – we all know where roads paved with good intentions might lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be more direct and practical we will explain things using the command-line tooling as a starting point. For development purposes, we have hosted an Arcan directory server at arcan.divergent-desktop.org for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net arcan.divergent-desktop.org explain&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a cached / petnamed entry already in the local keystore, e.g. ‘dd’:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net dd@ explain&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create an outbound a12-connection to arcan.divergent-desktop.org.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate an authentication keypair and query for trust unless known (TOFU).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue a LIST command with [notify] enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wait for a reply with a name field that matches ‘explain’.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue a download request for key-associated state matching package ID from #4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue a download request for the package ID from #4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify integrity of package from #6.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify authenticity of package compared to signature in manifest from #7.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unpack into temporary storage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start runner process with sandboxing and I/O transfer channels.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inject any state from #5 and signal runner to execute.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Join directory messaging group matching ID from #4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Map messages and dynamic resource access between runner and directory until termination.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cleanup and transfer state.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‘until termination’ point has three possible triggers. First one is the user simply shutting the application down. That would create a snapshot of application-persistent key-value pairs and upload into a matching slot from #5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other is that an updated version of the application appears (that would be signalled due to the notify- flag from the LIST command in #3). The default behaviour then is to initiate a download of the update matching steps (5,7,8,9) and have the runner store-restore state to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last is on a scripting error causing termination. The runner can be instructed to continue regardless; to snapshot, shutdown and retry; to rollback to a previous version. With any of these options the runner may also send a report rather than (possibly broken) state as per #14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage there is already a number of deviations from the hypertext transport way of doing things, and we have only taken a peek at the basics. Outside of the actual package format and Steps 5 and 13, the chain above is generic enough that it could as well have been a model for a mobile app store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, any code and necessary ‘offline first’ data is present in the initial package transfer. Its size and checksum is known as part of the LIST command so caching code+data is trivial. Package contents are signed, as is client managed state; altering either on the server side is a distinguishable error condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While hotly debated internally, the engine blocks any script loads outside of the signed package along with a small curated set of builtin ones. There is no facility ‘hide code in strings and unpack into eval()’ form of getting unsigned code to run and therefore no ‘middleboxes injecting code’ adtech style tampering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, any state store is deferred to the user and their decision to leverage (or not) an authentication key-bound server side store. There is no need for neither &lt;code&gt;cookies&lt;/code&gt; nor a ‘login’ form -
authentication primitives for the connection carry over to the
application layer and, if a server side processor is attached, salted to
an application-bound identifier as part of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, traffic is owned by the hosting directory. This is a big shift and ties heavily into the linking story. The engine configuration for the case we discuss here gets its primary traffic through either &lt;code&gt;arcan-net&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;afsrv_net&lt;/code&gt; when the outer
application also runs the desktop itself. These, in turn,
exclusively communicate with the specified directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This calls for a short example to get any further. Say that you have an A12 web app that is about image sharing and communication around shared images with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general UI, layouting and chat overlay is handled by the static signed appl package. Dynamic chat updates come through message passing events. The actual images do not make sense to share in the bundle expected to load/run at startup, so they are retrieved on demand from the server. In the old HTML world, that would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src="https://some.site/path/image_name.png?bunch_of_state_dont_leak"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an arcan appl, that would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;local stdin = net_open("@stdin", net_callback_handler)
local image_file = open_nonblock(stdin, {}, "image_name")
load_image_asynch(image_file, image_callback_handler)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The asynchronous event handlers and transfer queueing hints have been omitted for brevity. Here, &lt;code&gt;net_open&lt;/code&gt; gives a reference
handle to the current network connection. Then it is used to initiate a
non-blocking serialised read of &lt;code&gt;image_name&lt;/code&gt; that gets
forward to image decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All resource requests follow this pattern. The directory server is able to route / cache / load whatever is necessary to fulfill a request, and the reference implementation has several options for this, but the point is that the directory owns the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the client end this means that network filtering and monitoring can be very aggressive and request record/replay is trivial for both archival and development purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We finally have enough context to discuss links. The linking model here has two forms: “unified” and “referential”. The referential link is user facing, so we start there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a connection is made over A12, the initial handshake covers the expected local and remote roles: ‘Source’, ‘Sink’ or ‘Directory’. When hosting a directory server, you can specify outbound referential links through the &lt;code&gt;reference_directory('myfriend')&lt;/code&gt; function call
in the config scripting API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will create a worker that makes an outbound connection, and when this worker is alive and authenticated, it will be among the results sent in response to the LIST command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows local clients to open ‘myfriend’, either tunneled or redirected. The local and remote directory workers transfer public keys and other extended authentication primitives for ‘myfriend’ to transitively trust a new connection to some specified degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see a few properties for this kind of link:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bidirectional, authenticated and revocable - A link can only be established if the linked entity agrees to it, and it lives only as long as both parties maintain a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Typed - A path through directories always terminate at a directory, a hosted source, sink, or application and you know what you get in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Presence is reachability - The linking entity updates its local directory to reflect connection changes, and protocol propagates this to active clients.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rediscoverable - When walking the path of a link the clients learn about public keys of individual directories. The discovery protocol extension lets a linked entity be rediscovered even if the link itself has been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is clearly not without trade-offs. Transitive trust models and managing petnames to authentication primitives to stop Zooko’s Triangle can get complicated fast, even for networks of only your own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, DNS is not necessary. It is completely possible to navigate only through a path of petnames. The idea is that in a well-distributed web, we run into six degrees of separation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t link to resources within a hosted application. That is deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links being contractual sets a low cap on the amount of links that are feasible to maintain. That’s a feature, not a bug. The cost to resolve grows linearly with the number of directories in a path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A unified link is also specified in the config scripting API by calling the &lt;code&gt;link_directory('myfriend')&lt;/code&gt;. The main difference
against referential links is that the connection is not visible in the
client presented list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is because the linking parties form a unified namespace of exposed applications and their respective worker processes synch host applications, files and instance server side script runners as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Search and Indexing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last thing on the Web menu here is search in the sense of ‘From what we know and can access, what best matches your query?’ and not the ‘that we or our sponsors think that you should see’ variation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cheap solution is of course to leave it in the hands of developers and see what emerges. While that can come as a side effect of growth in popularity, part of the ‘many devices, one desktop’ narrative means that lower level mechanisms would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few parts of the protocol to leverage here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is that binary stream uploads/downloads have a few typed alternate slots. One such slot is METADATA. This means that with upload permission someone can pre-index/analyse locally, and attach that to the server side store going forward. Similarly, a controller providing, for example, an image hosting service can see that something does not have any metadata attached to it, fire up some analysis tool and attach the results itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another part is that the name part of requests that trigger binary stream transfers reserves the ‘.’ prefix for protocol support use. The server implementation uses .monitor, for instance, to negotiate an interactive debug interface stream and .debug to collect crash dumps that have accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another that gets special treatment is ‘.index’. Normally it can be downloaded as a means to list files in the private store attached to the key you authenticated to. It is also used to list available resources in the server-side store assigned to each controller by also specifying the namespace identifier that matches the application identifier that the controller is assigned to, and that would propagate across a network of unified links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you upload a file to ‘.index’ you actually slot in a filter that corresponds to your search query for that namespace. This will influence future ‘.index’ downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The server also has an external resolver mechanism. To understand this, both file and index resolving first goes to the controller. This has the option to reject it, or to forward or remap into its local file-store. The later can be substituted for an external resolver that takes care of translating to other protocols, e.g. AT, IPFS, Torrent with caching. This tactic is also used for implementing unified linking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to unpack here when it comes to protection against abuse and collaboratively reaching an accurate .index that all participants can sign off on -- but that is for a different day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Developer Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With enough protocol nuances in place we can dig into some of the practicalities in developing a networked Arcan application, but just enough to follow the web story here rather rather than the concrete APIs as such. For those there are numerous guides, step-by-step instructions and examples already in both Wiki and repository documentation format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing we need to recall is that an Arcan appl is a set of scripts with some minor file- and function name- patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minimal form is just this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir $ARCAN_APPLBASEPATH/myappl;
echo "function myappl()\nend\n" &amp;gt; $ARCAN_APPLBASEPATH/myappl/myappl.lua&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming that you have permission to install or update an appl (which are different permissions) to a directory server that will host it, all you have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net --sign-tag mykey --push-appl myappl somedir@&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will package, sign and transfer ‘myappl’ to the directory pointed to by ‘somedir’ in the current keystore. Creating an entry and generating keys can be done with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net keystore somedir host.or.ip&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will also tell you the public key that the server needs to grant permissions to. Setting one up has a lot more nuance to it, but with the arcan-net installation you would have a config.lua.example to work from and then run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net -c /path/to/my/config.lua&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then test-run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net somedir@ myappl&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which should just become a black window. Keep it running, but at the same time let’s push a change that would break it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo "function myappl()
    bad_function_call()
 end
" &amp;gt; $ARCAN_APPLBASEPATH/myappl/myappl.lua

arcan-net --sign-tag mykey --push-appl myappl somedir@&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The already running client downloads/update and it breaks. If configured to permit it will create a crash report, upload it and rollback to the last known working one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net --get-file myappl .report - somedir@&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That will collect user crash reports, bundle them together and send them back to us (and pipe to standard output). The reports are valid Lua scripts, so we can have analysis tooling that itself generates an appl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same tactic is used for slotting in a controller, just with --push-ctrl instead of --push-appl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To look at a more advanced example, we will take streaming media playback. The full appl code is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function myapp()
net_open("@stdin",
  function(source, status)
    if status.kind == "connected" then
      play_media(source)
    end
  end
  )
end

function play_media(ref)
  local fio = open_nonblock(ref, {}, "appl:/test")
  launch_decode(nil, "protocol=media",
    function(src, status)
      if status.kind == "bchunkstate" then
        open_nonblock(src, {}, fio)
      elseif status.kind == "resized" then
        show_image(src)
        resize_image(src, status.width, status.height)
      end
    end
  )
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is the &lt;code&gt;net_open&lt;/code&gt; call. This explicitly says
that we want to access and communicate with the directory that it was downloaded
from. Should that call fail, we can assume to be running offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;play_media&lt;/code&gt; function pairs two asynchronous processes. The
&lt;code&gt;open_nonblock&lt;/code&gt; part is used for non-blocking asynchronous file
input/output, both ones from within the appl package; from user-defined
namespaces and through existing processes via a reference handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first call goes through the handle to the network connection, and the appl:/ prefix tells it to go through the controller side application specific namespace. Any extra controls about transfer queueing/buffering/parallelisation preferences would go into the passed option table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;launch_decode&lt;/code&gt; part will spawn a media decoding process,
and by not providing it with direct input it will send a set of extensions it
supports (bchunkstate), that we ignore here and just pair with the resource
reference we got from previous &lt;code&gt;open_nonblock&lt;/code&gt; call. On the first
'resize' event we set the associated video object to visible and size to match
the source dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's slot in a matching controller:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function myapp()
end

function myapp_load(cl, resource)
  if resource == "test" then
    return "test.mp4"
  end
end

function myapp_store(cl, resource)
-- block all attempts at storing files
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_load&lt;/code&gt; entrypoint will be triggered when the client &lt;code&gt;open_nonblock&lt;/code&gt;
is issued. Here we map it to an actual file in the server-side store. This is where we
can add additional permission checks or selection logic. This is where the previously
mentioned 'external resolver' also fit, if the &lt;code&gt;config.lua&lt;/code&gt; set for the server
would say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function ready()
  local resolver =
    launch_resolver("/some/executable",
                    function(source, status)
                    end
                   )
  appl_set_resolver("myapp", resolver)
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mapped &lt;code&gt;test.mp4&lt;/code&gt; request would be forwarded to the process of
&lt;code&gt;/some/executable&lt;/code&gt; where we can have advanced mapping to other protocols and
storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's do something more advanced. We add an arcan-shmif client to the server-side policy database: &lt;code&gt;arcan_db add_target BIN xserver /usr/bin/Xarcan -exec wmaker&lt;/code&gt;. Then,
in the controller we add the following function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function myapp_join(cl)
  launch_target(cl, {}, "xserver",
    function(source, status)
    end
  )
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As soon as a client joins, the server would spawn an instance of an Xserver with the 'WindowMaker' window manager attached. This makes a loopback connection and registers as a hidden source only visible to the specified client. The client gets a notification that the source is available, and that would translate to a &lt;code&gt;segment_request&lt;/code&gt;
event in the &lt;code&gt;net_open&lt;/code&gt; event handler. If it accepts it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
net_open("@stdin",
function(source, status)
  if status.kind == "segment_request" then
    accept_target(640, 480, event_handler)
  end
end
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have the means to composite and interact with the source as if it had been launched locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this has been assuming that the client end has the Arcan stack installed and available. This might not be the case for weaker 'thin' kiosk like devices or in a more limited context, like one of those horrid vendor locked app ecosystems. Should the full stack be present on the directory server however, and the &lt;code&gt;config.permissions.applhost&lt;/code&gt; option be set to a tag (group)
matching your authentication key, a simplified viewer that only implements the
a12 protocol parts, like Smash,
could be used if the client request the appl as a source and not as an appl
package download. This would cause the server to spawn an instance of Arcan
with a loopback connection as a directed source to the specific client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of bringing all this up here is not as a practical guide, but to provide enough context to highlight a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tooling to browse, host and develop is the same. They are a property of the network solution itself, not ‘browser:developer tools’.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Updates are atomic and signed, making life much more difficult for parasitic intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every form of communication is explicit, from link contracts to how the appl communiate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The execution form is local-first, into locally-hosted, into networked.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The scaling model is small nodes, large networks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The 'frontend', 'backend' and server development model is one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Both client appl and controller are composable due to the naming scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In Closing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a lot of technical details omitted here around decisions and trade-offs and there is yet a small time window for change before all this is locked-in, especially around server side APIs and small-scale payment processing (with GNU taler being a strong candidate) to avoid the 'need' (they will always find a way) for Ad-tech parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other future plans involve preserving and translating current web contents into this, with tooling for layering in collaborative features over the contents. There is still ample room to join in and play around like it is the 90ies again, for a timeline that doesn't look so dark and grim as the current one does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, a substantial goal for all of this is personal agency over any kind of mass adoption -- I am stubborn, not naive. That anyone outside of a small group of tech die hards would go all Yippee Ki-Yay over this is a moonshot and that is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of places in my life and home where the current web- and browser- story will be pushed out. Places like my network cameras, heat pump HMI, various maker devices, home theater, gaming gear, mobile devices and so on. If I can only revert that I might at least tolerate that I still have to order groceries in some throwaway browser on a throwaway device. At least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Recall.ai we run an unusual workload. We record millions of meetings every week. We send meeting bots to calls so our customers can automate everything from meeting notes, to keeping the CRM up-to-date, to handling incidents, to providing live-feedback on the call and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Processing TB/s of real-time media streams is the thing we get asked most about. However an often-overlooked feature of meetings is their unusual synchronization. Most meetings start on the hour, some on the half, but most on the full. It sounds obvious to say it aloud, but the implication of this has rippled through our entire media processing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a picture of our load pattern. The y-axis is the number of EC2 instances in our fleet. Those large spikes are the bursts of meetings that we need to capture. And when the meeting starts, the compute capacity must be ready to process the incoming data, or it will be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extreme gradient of these spikes has resulted in us running into bottlenecks at almost every layer of the stack, from ARP to AWS. This is the story of a stubbornly mysterious issue, that led us to deeply examine postgres internals (again) and uncover an often overlooked postgres bottleneck that only rears its head at extremely high scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every postgres server starts and ends with the postmaster process. It is responsible for spawning and reaping children to handle connections and parallel workers, amongst other things. The postmaster runs a single-threaded main loop. With high worker churn, this loop can consume an entire CPU core, slowing down connection establishment, parallel queries, signal handling and more. This caused a rare, hard-to-debug issue where some of our EC2 instances would get delayed by 10-15s, waiting on the postmaster to fork a new backend to handle the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Slow connections to postgres&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Months ago we got alerted to large spike of delayed EC2 instances. We immediately investigated only to find that all of them were actually ready and waiting. We initially suspected a slow query caused the delay but we ruled this out. Eventually we uncovered that the delay originated from additional time connecting to postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Postgres has its own binary wire protocol. The client sends a startup message, to which the server responds with an auth request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we observed was truly bizarre, the client would successfully establish a TCP connection to postgres, however the startup message only receive a response after 10s. Here is a example what we saw:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The initial TCP SYN packet is sent from the client&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Less than one millisecond later the server responds with a SYN,ACK and the client ACK's to establish the connection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The client send the startup message to the postgres server and the server ACK's the message&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10s later the server responds with an auth request and the connection continue nominally from there&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ruled out obvious resource bottlenecks such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O and so forth. With all of these metrics looking nominal we turned to a deeper inspection of postgres internals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A reproduction environment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We observed that the delay only occurred during the largest spikes, when many thousands of EC2 instances were booting. Notably, it seemed to occur sporadically, maybe only once or twice a week. We host our database on RDS Postgres, which complicated the matter as low-level telemetry is limited. So we resorted to creating a production-like reproduction environment that we could use to continue our investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this setup we used redis pub/sub to trigger a highly synchronized connection to postgres from a fleet of 3000+ EC2 instances. As we installed postgres on its own EC2 instance, we were able to instrument it while reproducing the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A deep dive into the postmaster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step was to form a hypothesis which we could validate. To do this we inspected the postgres source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every postgres has a supervisor process that is responsible for spawing and reaping new backends and workers. This process is called the postmaster (I love this name). The postmaster is designed as a single-threaded server loop that processes its events synchronously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ServerLoop&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;ChildReaper: Reap exited child processes (workers, backends, etc).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;AcceptConnection: Launch a new backend to handle a connection.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;LaunchBackgroudWorkers: Launch background workers for a parallel queries.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our hypothesis was that the burst of new connections would temporarily overwhelm the postmaster loop, causing it to lag behind the queue of incoming connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Profiling the postmaster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this we profiled the postmaster process under these periods of connection spikes in our simulated environment. It was surprisingly easy to pin the postmaster process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ran the postgres on a &lt;code&gt;r8g.8xlarge&lt;/code&gt; instance.
At about ~1400 connections/sec we saturated the postmaster main loop and start to observe noticable delays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt; we took sampling profile of the postmaster while it was under duress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As expected the overwhelming majority of the time is spent spawning and reaping backends. It turns out &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; can be expensive! &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Huge pages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick aside on how &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; on linux works. When you call &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;, it spawns a new "child" process, an exact duplicate of the parent continuing from the same instruction as the parent.
However, copying the parent's memory pages would be prohibitively expensive for how &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; is typically used. So linux employs a trick here, the pages are Copy-on-Write. This optimization means the copy only happens when the child process tries to modify a parent's memory page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a catch however, linux still needs to copy the parent's page table entries (PTEs). Reducing the number of PTEs decreases the overhead of forking the process. On Linux this is easy to do. You can enable huge pages in the kernel using &lt;code&gt;sudo echo $NUM_PAGES &amp;gt; /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages&lt;/code&gt; and configuring postgres to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enabling huge pages results in a large reduction in the postmaster PTE size. Empirically we found a 20% throughput increase in connection rate with &lt;code&gt;huge_pages = on&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Background workers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To further complicate the matter, the postmaster is also responsible for launching background workers for parallel queries. A high rate of parallel queries further increases increase the stress on postmaster main loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION bg_worker_churn(iterations integer)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
DECLARE
  i int;
BEGIN
  PERFORM set_config('force_parallel_mode','on', true);

  CREATE TABLE data (id BIGINT);
  INSERT INTO data SELECT generate_series(0, 100000);
  ANALYZE data;
  FOR i IN 1..iterations LOOP
    PERFORM sum(id) FROM data;
  END LOOP;
  DROP TABLE data;
END;
$function$;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high background worker churn rate also puts pressure on the postmaster main loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unravelling the mystery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In production we only observed the connection delays sporadically. We determinated that was due to a confounding factor of increased background worker churn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The smoking gun was in our database monitoring the whole time, which showed the spike in background worker shutdown load at the time of the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were able to simulate a high background worker churn in parallel with the connection flood and observed a large decrease connection throughput from the postmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We correlated this query with one our endpoints using a query that triggered a parllel execution plan, that would occasionally coincide with our hourly peaks, resulting in the delayed connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fixing the issue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we deeply understand the failure mode we can mechnically reason about a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implementing jitter in our fleet of EC2 instances reduced the peak connection rate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eliminating bursts of parallel queries from our API servers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of these significantly reduce the pressure on the postmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many pieces of wisdom in the engineering zeitgeist are well preached but poorly understood. Postgres connection pooling falls neatly into this category. In this expedition we found one of the underlying reasons that connection pooling is so widely deployed on postgres systems running at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most online resources chalk this up to connection churn, citing fork rates and the pid-per-backend yada, yada. This is all true but in my opinion misses the forest from the trees. The real bottleneck is the single-threaded main loop in the postmaster. Every operation requiring postmaster involvement is pulling from a fixed pool, the size of a single CPU core. A rudimentary experiment shows that we can linearly increase connection throughput by adding additional postmasters on the same host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite kinds of discoveries: an artificial constraint that has warped the shape of the developer ecosystem (RDS Proxy, pgbouncer, pgcat, etc) around it. Hopefully to be lifted one day!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside: it's mildly absurd that none of the DBaaS or monitoring tools provide observability into postmaster contention. What's going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research-oriented starter kit for runescape-style bots, including a typescript sdk, agent documentation and bindings, and a server emulator. Works out of the box - tell it what to automate!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build and operate bots within a complex economic role-playing MMO. You can automate the game, level an account to all 99s, and experiment with agentic development techniques within a safe, bot-only setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goals of this project are to provide a rich testing environment for goal-directed program synthesis techniques (Ralph loops, etc), and to facilitate research into collaboration and competition between agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is currently a leaderboard for bots running on the demo server, with rankings based on highest total level per lowest account playtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RS-SDK is a fork of the LostCity engine/client, an amazing project without which rs-sdk would not be possible. Find their code here or read their history and ethos&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/MaxBittker/rs-sdk.git&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the box, you can connect to the provided demo server, choose a name that is not already taken!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With claude code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun install
claude "start a new bot with name: {username}"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun install
bun scripts/create-bot.ts {username}
bun bots/{username}/script.ts &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat is off by default to prevent scamming and prompt injection attacks, but you can opt in with &lt;code&gt;SHOW_CHAT=true&lt;/code&gt; in the bot.env file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warning: The demo server is offered as a convenience, and we do not guarantee uptime or data persistence. Hold your accounts lightly, and consider hosting your own server instance. Please do not manually play on the demo server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This server has a few modifications from the original game to make development and bot testing easier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Faster leveling - The XP curve is accelerated and less steep.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Infinite run energy - Players never run out of energy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No random events - Anti-botting random events are disabled&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;rs-sdk runs against an enhanced web-based client (&lt;code&gt;botclient&lt;/code&gt;) which connects to the LostCity 2004scape server emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gateway server which accepts connections from botclient and SDK instances, and forwards messages between them based on username. Once connected to the gateway, the botclient will relay game state to the SDK, and execute low-level actions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;walkTo(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;) sent from the SDK through the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that the SDK can't talk directly to the game server, but must go through the botclient. It will attempt to launch the botclient on startup if one is not already running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't need to run the gateway/botclient in order to run automations against the demo server, but you may choose to if you are fixing bugs or adding features to the rs-sdk project&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want all these running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd engine &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bun run start&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd webclient &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bun run watch&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd gateway &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bun run gateway&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a login server which you may not need, I forget&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a free, open-source, community-run project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is strictly education and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LostCity Server was written from scratch after many hours of research and peer review. Everything you see is completely and transparently open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have not been endorsed by, authorized by, or officially communicated with Jagex Ltd. on our efforts here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product Engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location: NYC (in-person)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help us build everything a consumer brand needs to grow. Weâre just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Youâll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you'll do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ship product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples of projects you could own:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What we're looking for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compensation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private health, dental, and vision insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pension &amp;amp; 401k contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview process*&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why youâd be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We raised $5.7M from some of the best investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;James Hawkins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nicolas Dessaigne&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Founding team&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did you knowâ¦&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All co-founders have written code that has run in production as part of Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We closed our first publicly traded company during our YC batch from our living room in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Tiago (Founding Engineer) worked together when Thomas was just an intern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michel (Customer Success) was responsible for most of the incoming Converge Support tickets in his previous job as a freelance tracking consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Jan were best friends in high school, and Jan and Jerome met in their first year of college.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI is Killing B2B SaaS&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;SaaS is the most profitable business model on Earth.1 It’s easy to understand why: build once, sell the same thing again ad infinitum, and don’t suffer any marginal costs on more sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing software for more than half my life. In the last year itself, I’ve talked to hundreds of founders and operators in SF, from preseed to Series E companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is bringing an existential threat to a lot of B2B SaaS executives: How to keep asking customers for renewal, when every customer feels they can get something better built with vibe-coded AI products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the market is pricing it in. Morgan Stanley’s SaaS basket has lagged the Nasdaq by 40 points since December. HubSpot and Klaviyo are down ~30%. Analysts are writing notes titled “No Reasons to Own” software stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The relation between vibe coding and B2B SaaS sales&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new problem for B2B SaaS is that with AI, customers can get something working with vibe coding. There are tens of vibe coding “internal tool” services that promise to connect to every integration in the world to pump out CRUD and workflow apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever they build simply works. It takes some wrangling to get there (one Series C VP listed eleven different vibe coding tools they’ve tried and the pros and cons between each on a phone call once), but productivity gains are immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And vibe coding is fun. You feel like a mad wizard using the right incantation 2 to get this magical new silicon intelligence to do exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they don’t know, though, is that a poorly architected system will fail, eventually. As every senior programmer (eventually) understands, our job is complex because we have to understand the relationships in the real world, the processes involved, and the workflows needed, and representing it in a robust way to create a stable system. AI can’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-programmers don’t know any of this nuance. One Series E CEO told me that they’re re-evaluating the quarterly renewal of their engineering productivity software because they along with an engineer reimplemented something using Github and Notion APIs. They were paying $30,000 to a popular tool3 and they were not going to renew anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does it impact B2B sales?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If customers feel like they aren’t being served exactly like they want to, they are more likely to churn. The reason behind all this is that customers are demanding more from their B2B vendors, because they know what’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, you would change your company to fit what your ERP and pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, everyone can see that agentic coding makes an unprecedented level of flexibility possible. And customers are demanding that flexibility, and if they don’t get it, they’ll leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week itself I was on a phone call with a Series B AE talking about how they’re potentially losing an $X00,000 account just because the customer can’t use a specific failure reporting workflow in the SaaS. They’re now working with me to build what the customer needs and retain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to survive&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Be a System of Record&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the entire company’s workflows operates on your platform, i.e. you’re a line-of-business SaaS, you are integrated into their existing team already. They know your UI and rely on you on the day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, to create a data visualization I won’t seek any SaaS. I’ll just code one myself using many of the popular vibe coding tools (my team actually did that and it’s vastly more flexible than what we’d get off-the-shelf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a “System of Record” means you’re embedded so deeply that there’s no choice but to win. My prediction is that we’ll see more SaaS companies go from the application layer to offering their robust SoR as their primary selling point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Security, authentication, and robustness&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where vibe-coded apps silently fail — and where established SaaS platforms earn their keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a non-technical team vibe-codes an internal tool, they’re not thinking about environment keys, XSS vulnerabilities or API keys hardcoded in client-side JavaScript. They’re not implementing rate limiting, audit logs, or proper session management. They’re definitely not thinking about SOC 2 compliance, GDPR data residency requirements, or HIPAA audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen it firsthand: a finance team built a “quick” expense approval tool that stored unencrypted reports in a public S3 bucket. A sales ops team created a commission calculator that anyone with the URL could access — no auth required. These aren’t edge cases. They’re the norm when software is built without security as a foundational concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise SaaS platforms have spent years (and millions) solving these problems: role-based access control, encryption at rest and in transit, penetration testing, compliance certifications, incident response procedures. Your customers may not consciously value this — until something breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that security is invisible when it works. You need to communicate this value proactively: remind customers that the “simple” tool they could vibe-code themselves would require them to also handle auth, permissions, backups, uptime, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Adapt to the customer, not the other way around&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times of asking customers to change how they work are gone. Now, SaaS vendors that differentiate by being ultra customizable win the hearts of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? It’s the most powerful secret to increase usage. We’ve all heard the classic SaaS problem where the software is sold at the beginning of the year, but no one actually ends up using it because of how inflexible it is and the amount of training needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if a SaaS is underutilized, it gets noticed. And that leads to churn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the case with one of my customers, they have a complex SaaS for maintenance operations. But turns out, this was not being used at the technician level because they found the UI too complex4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How I’m solving this is essentially a whitelabelled vibe-coding platform with in-built distribution and secure deployments. When they heard of my solution they were immediately onboard. Their customer success teams quickly coded a very specific mobile webapp for the technicians to use and deployed it in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the IC technician is exposed to just those parts of the SaaS that they care about i.e. creating maintenance work orders. The executives get what they want too, vibe coding custom reports exactly the way they want vs going through complicated BI config. They are able to build exactly what they want and feel like digital gods while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usage for that account was under 35%, and is now over 70%. They are now working closely with me to vibe code new “micro-apps” that work according to all of their customer workflows. And the best part? This is all on top of their existing SaaS which works as a system of record and handles security, authentication, and supports lock-in by being a data and a UI moat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what I’m building: a way for SaaS companies to let their end-users vibe code on top of their platform (More on that below). My customers tell me it’s the best thing they’ve done for retention, engagement, and expansion in 2026 – because when your users are building on your platform, they’re not evaluating your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Real Shift&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve realized after hundreds of conversations with founders and operators: AI isn’t killing B2B SaaS. It’s killing B2B SaaS that refuses to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SaaS model was built on a simple premise: we build it once, you pay forever. That worked when building software was hard. But now your customers have tasted what’s possible. They’ve seen their finance team whip up a custom dashboard in an afternoon. They’ve watched a non-technical PM build an internal tool that actually fits their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t unsee that. You can’t go back to paying $X0,000/year for software that almost does what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survivors won’t be the SaaS companies with the best features. They’ll be the ones who become platforms – who let customers build on top of them instead of instead of them. When I showed a well-known VC what I was building to help SaaS companies do exactly this, he said: “This is the future of marketplaces and software companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe. Or maybe this is just another cycle and traditional SaaS will adapt like it always has. But I know this: the companies I’m talking to aren’t waiting around to find out. They’re already rebuilding their relationship with customers from “use our product” to “build on our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether AI will eat your SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s whether you’ll be the one holding the fork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m solving exactly this problem with a whitelabelled AI platform for B2B SaaS companies, so your users can vibe code customized workflows on top of their existing system of record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My customers tell me this is the best way to support retention, engagement, and expansion in 2026.

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, my friend and fellow Recurser, Frank, picked up an arcade machine for the Recurse Center. We call it the RCade. He wanted to leave the original CRT in - which I think is a great choice! - and drove it off of a Raspberry Pi. Eventually we wanted to move to a more powerful computer, but we needed a way to connect it to the display. Off-hand, I mentioned that I could build a CRT display adapter that interfaces with a normal computer over USB. This is that project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the display expects&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CRT in the RCade has a JAMMA connector, and Frank bought a converter that goes between VGA and JAMMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think we could just use an off-the-shelf VGA adapter to drive it at this point, but it's not that simple. The CRT runs at a weird resolution; We started with 320x240 but eventually wanted to target 336x262, which is super non-standard. Even 320x240 is unattainable by most display adapters, which typically can't go below 640x480. A custom solution would allow us to output any arbitrary resolution we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that the Pi, with the VGA board we were using, only supports 18-bit colour, and we wanted to improve this. Even on the RCade's CRT, colour banding was an obvious issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to use a laptop, not a desktop, which meant not using a PCI-e card. Instead, a USB interface would be preferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, but what is VGA?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;VGA is a signaling protocol that maps almost exactly 1:1 with what a CRT actually does.&lt;/p&gt;Taken from wikimedia.org&lt;p&gt;Inside of a CRT, there are 3 electron guns, which correspond to red, green, and blue colour values. Two electromagnets in the neck of the tube are responsible for steering the beam - one steers horizontally and one steers vertically. To draw an image, the beam moves across the screen one horizontal line at a time, and the electron guns are rapidly modulated in order to display the correct colour at each pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VGA contains analog signals for these R, G, and B electron guns. It also contains an HSYNC and VSYNC signal, which are used so that the driver and the CRT can agree on what pixel is being drawn at a given time. Between the VGA input and the CRT is a very simple circuit which locks onto these HSYNC and VSYNC pulses and synchronizes the sweeping of the beam.&lt;/p&gt;Taken from pyroelectro.com&lt;p&gt;The HSYNC pulses happen in between horizontal lines, and the VSYNC pulses happen in between frames. There are dead zones around each pulse - referred to as the front and back porch - which give the electron beam time to sweep back across the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, all we really need are those R, G, B, HSYNC, and VSYNC signals, running at precise timing, and synced properly relative to each other. Conceptually this is actually pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt 1: Using the RP2040's PIO&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the Raspberry Pi RP2040 a lot. It's relatively cheap (around $1 USD) and has tons of on-board RAM - 264 KB in fact! It also has what is called Programmable IO, or PIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've never used the PIO before, but the basic idea is that you can write assembly programs where every instruction takes exactly one cycle, and has useful primitives for interacting with GPIO. It's a fairly limited instruction set, but it allows for bit-banging precise cycle-accurate custom protocols. It's exactly what I need to modulate a VGA signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PIO code ended up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// 1. low for 320+16=336 pixels // 2. high for 30 pixels // 3. low for 34 pixels // 4. repeat // runs on sm0 // 6 instrs -&amp;gt; can save some with sidesetting let hsync = pio::pio_asm!( ".wrap_target", /* begin pixels + front porch */ "irq set 0 [2]", // tell vsync we're doing 1 line "set pins, 1 [31]", // go low for 32 "set X, 8 [15]", // +16 = 48 "a:", "jmp X-- a [31]", // each loop 32, * 9 = 288, total = 336 /* end front porch, being assert hsync */ "set pins, 0 [29]", // assert hsync for 30 /* end assert hsync, begin back porch */ "set pins, 1 [29]", // deassert, wait 32 (note there is extra delay after the wrap) ".wrap" ); // NOTE - we get irq at *end* of line so we have to time things accordingly // 1. low for 242 lines -&amp;gt; but irq 2 every line for the first 240 // 2. high for 3 lines // 3. low for 22 lines // 4. repeat // runs on sm1 // 19 instr let vsync = pio::pio_asm!( ".side_set 1 opt", ".wrap_target", "set Y, 6", "a_outer:", "set X, 31", "a:", "wait 1 irq 0", "irq set 2", "jmp X-- a", // 32 lines per inner loop "jmp Y-- a_outer", // 7 outer loops = 224 "set X, 15", // 16 more lines = 240 "z:" "wait 1 irq 0", "irq set 2", "jmp X-- z", "wait 1 irq 0", // wait for end of last rgb line "wait 1 irq 0", // 2 more lines for front porch "wait 1 irq 0", "set X, 2 side 0", // assert vsync "b:", "wait 1 irq 0", "jmp X-- b", // wait for 3 lines "set X, 20 side 1", // deassert vsync "c:", "wait 1 irq 0", "jmp X-- c" // wait for 21 lines (back porch) ".wrap", ); // 2 cycles per pixel so we run at double speed // 6 instr let rgb = pio::pio_asm!( "out X, 32", // holds 319, which we have to read from the FIFO ".wrap_target", "mov Y, X", "wait 1 irq 2", // wait until start of line "a:", "out pins, 16", // write to rgb from dma "jmp Y-- a", "mov pins, NULL", // output black ".wrap" );&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full code lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 separate PIO programs. &lt;code&gt;hsync&lt;/code&gt; is responsible for keeping time and generating HSYNC pulses. At the start of each line, it generates an IRQ event that the other programs use for synchronization. &lt;code&gt;vsync&lt;/code&gt; counts these events and generates the VSYNC pulses. Finally, &lt;code&gt;rgb&lt;/code&gt; reads pixel data from DMA and outputs to the RGB pins in precise time with the other signals. The &lt;code&gt;out pins, 16&lt;/code&gt; signifies that we're only doing 16-bit colour for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of weirdness in here to get around the constraints of the PIO. For example, between all 3 programs, only a maximum of 31 instructions are allowed. All of the VGA parameters (resolution, porch length, etc.) are hard-coded, and changing these would require at least a small rewrite. It's pretty brittle in that regard, but for our use-case it's sufficient as a proof-of-concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it is running the actual CRT in the RCade:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to fill the framebuffer with a repeating pattern, but I messed up my code, hence it looking weird. That's fine - it was enough to verify my VGA program worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, every time I popped off the back of the RCade to work on it was terrifying. Not because of the lethal voltages inside, but because Recursers absolutely love the RCade. I often joke that if I were to break it, I would basically be the anti-Frank!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I had something that could take a framebuffer and throw it onto the CRT, it was time to get the image from my computer to the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let's write a kernel module!&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan was to write a Linux kernel module that would expose itself as a framebuffer, and then send that framebuffer over USB to the RP2040. On the framebuffer side, this involved interfacing with the DRM layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually made decent progress here, although I kernel panicked many, many times. I never bothered to set up a proper development environment (oops), so pretty much any bug would require me to reboot my computer. This was super annoying and tedious, although I did learn a lot. I found cursed things in the official documentation, like interrobangs!&lt;/p&gt;Linus pls&lt;p&gt;I got as far as getting a framebuffer to show up at the correct resolution and refresh rate. Along this journey though, I discovered the GUD kernel module, and quickly realized I should use that instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GUD is... pretty good&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so this GUD thing is sick. It's a USB display adapter protocol - exactly what I need! It was originally designed to send video from a computer to a Pi Zero for use as a secondary display. It consists of an upstreamed (!!!) kernel module that runs on the host, and separate gadget software that runs on the Pi Zero. I decided I would just write my own gadget implementation to run on the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a protocol, GUD seems decent. It supports compression over the wire, and only sends the deltas of what's changed in the host's framebuffer. It's also pretty robust in terms of allowing the gadget to advertise what features it supports - compression is optional, and there's flexibility in colour depth and resolution. And again, it's upstreamed into the kernel, so anyone on modern Linux could use my display adapter with no software tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, GUD has almost no documentation. I figured out what I needed to do by reverse engineering the kernel module, which involved recompiling it to add some debugging statements. The protocol is simple enough that is wasn't too much of a hassle, and it didn't take long before I had developed a gadget implementation in Rust for the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, we saw our first Linux images on the CRT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, it looks terrible. Several years ago, I had built a board that implements the R/G/B DACs out of resistors, and I reused that for this project. It can only do 12 bits of colour maximum, and for this test I only bothered to wire up ~2 bits per channel, which is basically unusable. But it proves the concept works!&lt;/p&gt;The board I built several years ago. It was originally designed to fit an STM32 development board.&lt;p&gt;To be honest, it's pretty lucky that this board came with me to New York. I'm surprised I didn't either throw it out or move it to my parent's place. It was probably in some other box of things I deemed worth keeping around.&lt;/p&gt;The VGA board connected to the RP2040.&lt;p&gt;You can see from the above picture that I really connected the bare minimum for a proof-of-concept. I find perfboard soldering to be a bit tedious!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, you may notice in the video that the entire screen is shifted to the left. The left side has wrapped around and is now on the right side. On initial boot, it would look fine; over time it would gradually get worse and worse. This is a bug in my implementation - I suspect it's some kind of buffer underflow that's happening, such that each time it occurs, the PIO gets progressively more out of sync. But this is just a guess; I didn't look into it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colour depth issue is trivial to fix, but this next one isn't. The framerate sucks! You can even see it in the video above, where you can watch the new frame scroll down the screen. The RP2040 can only do USB FS (full-speed), which is capable of 11 Mbps. At the 320x240x16 bpp we were originally targeting, every frame is 153.6 kB. At our maximum USB FS speed, that's less than 10 FPS! Embarrasingly, I had originally done the math with a bandwidth of 11 MBps, not 11 Mbps, so I was off by a factor of 8. I was hoping to get something at least temporarily usable but had to go back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going on a GUD gadget side quest&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who even needs microcontrollers anyway? My next idea was to use the normal GUD gadget implementation, running on a Pi Zero, but outputting to VGA over GPIO. Conceptually this is pretty simple, although in practice it was anything but. The canonical GUD gadget software was based on a 2021 version of Buildroot, which was too old to output VGA. I tried, and failed, to update the Buildroot version, as well as to backport the VGA overlay. Neither of those really worked, but I didn't really know what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also played around with generating a custom NixOS image that had a modern kernel and the GUD gadget kernel module. When that didn't work I prepared to run a user space GUD gadget implementation on Raspberry Pi OS. But like, isn't that boring? And then I'll still be stuck at 18 bit colour! And sometimes a girl just wants to tickle her electrons :3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt... 2? 3? 1+i? Returning to MCU land&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so my beloved RP2040 doesn't support USB HS (high-speed). My beloved RP2350 (the newer version of the same chip) doesn't either. But some of my beloved STM32s do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially I was planning to go computer -&amp;gt; USB HS -&amp;gt; STM32 -&amp;gt; SPI bus -&amp;gt; RP2040 -&amp;gt; VGA. But like, that's complicated, and there are 2 microcontrollers to program, and there is so much to go wrong, and the SPI bus protocol is going to need to be robust against lost/extra bits, and AAAAAAAAAA I don't wanna!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But! STM32! I learned through research that some of the nicer ones have an LTDC peripheral, which, among other things, can drive an LCD display. And guess what? Many LCDs take in an R, G, B, HSYNC, and VSYNC signal. That's right - they pretend they're a CRT, and they pretend they have a cute little electron gun inside of them, and the STM32 is like "ok I got u" and can just like, do this natively. And I realize that this is what VGA is, but it's so, so funny to me that the protocol is literally just the manifestation of a physical design that is largely obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so at this point I'm like, is this even a real project anymore? I'm just connecting the USB peripheral to the LTDC peripheral. What part of this is supposed to take effort? I had already written the GUD gadget implementation. Wasn't I basically already done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OH BOY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by now it's Christmas time and I fly back to Canada to hang out with my family, as you would expect. I had none of my hardware with me, so now felt like a good time to design the actual board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Christmas Eve, this is what I had. Conceptually, it's a pretty basic board - there's the USB HS input, the VGA output, 3 8-bit DACs, some RAM for the framebuffer, and supporting components. At the heart of it is the STM32H723, which is a microcontroller that's advertised as supporting USB HS and LTDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth talking about the DACs a bit. They have a few requirements. They need to map the 8-bit binary space uniformly to the analog domain. They also need to act as a resistor divider - my I/O is at 3.3V, but VGA expects a maximum of 0.7 volts for R/G/B. And finally, they need to be impedance-matched to the 75 ohms of the VGA cable, to prevent reflections and ringing that show up in the image. I am... pretty doubtful we need this at our resolution, but it doesn't hurt, and it increases nerd cred (^:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encoded all of these requirements into a system of equations, threw it into a SAT solver, and computed all of my resistor values. I checked the output manually and it made sense, so I used these values in my DAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting is the length-matched traces between the STM32 and the HyperRAM. Length-matching ensures that all the signals arrive at the same time; if some arrive too early or late it can cause issues. The traces aren't impedance-matched, but I did a bit of math and determined they were short enough that I didn't have to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to talk about the USB port. I used Mini-USB. Alright look. I know I know, I should have used USB-C. But I don't like USB-C! It's a dumb standard. We spent decades teaching non-technical users to plug the square wire into the square hole and the round wire into the round hole. And then we made every hole the same shape!! But they don't all support the same things!! Not even every cable supports the same things!! I hate it!! And Mini-USB is so cute. It's not reversible, but who cares? It's more robust than micro USB, while still being small. And it's my board, my rules. So yes, I will keep sending pictures of this board to people, and they will keep complaining it doesn't use USB-C. And I will continue to not care! Mini-USB is CUTE. And by the way, if you read this entire article and this is the section you choose to engage with, then you are boring!!! You will never live up to Mini-USB!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay okay sorry about that. I am calm now. With all of that out of the way, I placed the order for the boards. I bought 5 of them, 2 of which were partially assembled. I would complete the rest of the assembly myself, but I didn't want to worry about the more finicky stuff. Between taxes, tariffs, and shipping, it came to a little over a hundred dollars USD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week later, I was back home in NYC. My boards hadn't arrived yet, although I did have access to an STM32H723 development board at this point. To prepare for my boards, I started porting my RP2040 firmware to the STM32H723.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things were going well until I tried getting USB set up. For some reason, I could only get it working at USB FS speeds. I figured I was just initializing something wrong - maybe a register I was forgetting about, or that wasn't in the HAL? I did a lot of digging, before finding this hidden in the datasheet (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devices embed a USB OTG high-speed (up to 480 Mbit/s) device/host/OTG peripheral that supports both full-speed and high-speed operations. It integrates the transceivers for full-speed operation (12 Mbit/s) and a UTMI low-pin interface (ULPI) for high-speed operation (480 Mbit/s). When using the USB OTG_HS interface in HS mode, an external PHY device connected to the ULPI is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart sank. Yes, despite this chip very clearly advertising support for USB HS, it can't actually do that without an external PHY. This is super easy to miss - I actually told other people about the problem, and often they would tell me I was incorrect until I showed it to them in the datasheet. I've also found many posts on the ST Community forums from people running into the same thing. So yeah, I need a new board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because boards are expensive, I figure I'll still use the rev 1 board to validate as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes, again&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the boards come, I complete assembly of one, plug it into my computer, and nothing happens. I find out that the 3.3V rail is shorted to ground. This is the same on all of my boards, even the 3 that are disassembled. Some debugging later, it turns out I moved a via in KiCad and didn't do a re-pour. My ground plane was connected to my power plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a full CI/CD pipeline set up for my PCBs, so I was surprised it didn't catch this. It turns out it has a bit of wiggle-room, and the re-pour was small enough it didn't get picked up. I now know I need to be disciplined and run DRC locally, ensuring there are literally no differences (and if there are, commit them and push them up to my Git forge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although annoying, and quite embarrassing, this wasn't a huge deal. I used a drill bit and very carefully drilled out the offending via by hand. It made a bit of a mess - make sure you use breathing protection - but I got a board that worked.&lt;/p&gt;The drilled-out via. You can see it directly under the text, near the center-bottom of the image.&lt;p&gt;At this point I wrote some code that exercised the HyperRAM and VGA. Everything worked great, so I began work on the new board. Here's what my development setup looked like while I was testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the rev 1 board didn't work out, Frank pointed out that the difference between it and the previous revision was stark:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a bad pace of development!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt 4 - Rev 2&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I needed an STM32 that supported ULPI (used for talking to the USB PHY), LTDC, and some kind of external RAM. I looked at dozens of chips and found all sorts of blockers. Chips that actually supported both (but they had overlapping pins), chips that were advertised as supporting both (but in actuality, could only do one or the other, depending on the specific model number), and chips that actually could do both, with unconflicting pins, but only in a BGA package. I did not particularly want to deal with that, mainly because the tiny vias and traces would balloon the board cost even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up settling on the STM32H750IBT, a massive, 176 pin, LQFP chip. This thing is larger than some New York apartments, and at over $10 USD, it costs about the same! I have bought entire dev boards for a fraction of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I picked out the chip, I basically redesigned the entire board from scratch. Sure, I could reuse the DACs, but I needed completely new RAM (the new chip has no HyperBus), as well as the USB PHY and supporting components. Now that my Christmas vacation was over, it took me a solid week to get everything designed. This isn't my most complicated board, but it's certainly my most complex routing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, look at those traces. I'm using basically all available space just to get them to be the same length. ST famously has bad pinouts, and because one of the memory controller pins is located on the complete opposite side of the chip, literally all of the rest of the RAM traces had to be lengthened. And the RAM has a 16-bit data bus. I had to route 38 length-matched traces for the memory alone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USB PHY also had a decent number of traces to route, although far less than the RAM. This is probably the part where I'm supposed to say that like, crosstalk is bad and stuff, but we're just gonna ignore that. I had like no space; leave me alone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the board looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, I ordered the board. Waiting for it to arrive just about killed me, but when it finally did, I got to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Board bring-up&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board bring-up is a magical thing. One-by-one, you enable each part of the board, and you make sure that everything works the way you expect. Given that USB burned me before, I decided to start there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right out of the gate, I was off to a bumpy start. I got the USB technically working, and I even got it to show up on my computer as USB HS (yay!), but it was super, super flaky. Eventually I worked out that its crystal oscillator was unstable. Going back to the datasheet, I realized I missed a 1M ohm resistor, which was meant to be put in parallel with the crystal. I didn't have one handy, but I know the human body is around that resistance. I put one finger on each terminal of the crystal. It immediately stabilized. I was pretty ecstatic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I went to the Recurse Center and stole a 1M ohm resistor to affix to the board. (Faculty, if you're reading this, I owe you about a tenth of a cent. Sorry!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that over, the rest of the bring-up process was pretty smooth. I got the LTDC running and ported over the rest of the code that implemented the GUD protocol. I had written things pretty naively but, to my surprise, it didn't need any optimization for high-speed USB. I guess that's what a microcontroller with a 480 MHz core will get you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running it in the RCade cabinet&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was already at the Recurse Center at this point, so I popped the back off the RCade, unplugged the VGA from the Pi, and plugged it into my board. It started up immediately - the colours looked great and I got the full 60 Hz framerate. To be honest, I was shocked at how good it looked, and the crowd that had formed was shocked too. I wasn't really a believer that 24 bit colour would be noticeable, but I was totally wrong. The lack of colour banding was striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I plugged the board into the Pi, and Frank reconfigured it to make my display adapter the primary display. We launched the normal RCade software and played some games. They looked truly amazing; nothing like before. Rose, one of the main people who developed the software, joked that it looked so good that some of the graphical shortcuts she took were no longer sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell in the pictures but the difference in person was striking. Where it's most obvious is in the lack of banding around the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This felt amazing, but I wasn't quite ready to leave the board installed. It was fragile - especially with the resistor I bodged on - and it was expensive. I took my board back out and Frank reverted the RCade to how it was before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing a case&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest. I don't get that much joy out of 3D modeling. I find it frustrating, tedious, and generally unfulfilling. To get around this, I decided to use YAPP to design the case. YAPP is a parametric box generator written in OpenSCAD. I wrote a few dozen lines of code and ended up with this beauty:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took barely any time at all and only took 2 physical revisions before I was happy with it. I added the OpenSCAD code to my board repository and CI/CD pipeline. Now, it builds all the files I need to order the boards, as well as the STL files for the case.&lt;/p&gt;HE'S BEGINNING TO TAKE FORM&lt;p&gt;And now, with the board in the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I was starting to prepare myself to install it in the RCade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes, again??&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything was done, so I expected I'd just plug it in and be good to go. When I did this, though, nothing happened. After some debugging I realized the USB had completely died on my board. It wasn't showing up on any computer I connected it to, although the STM32 was still chugging along happily (and outputting to VGA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still haven't figured out exactly what happened here. I was having a bit of flakiness with the USB already. I vaguely suspect ESD to either the STM32 or the USB PHY, but am not super confident this is the cause. I'm going to keep looking into this. (inb4: wow maybe you shouldn't have touched the crystal without grounding yourself first!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I assembled a second board and got that installed instead. I'm slightly nervous because I don't have a third board to use if this one also dies, and I don't want to order any more until I can figure out what's killing them. That said, it has been a few days now since I installed it, and despite running 24/7, there's no signs of it dying yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the board in its case, installed in the RCade. We're still running it off the Raspberry Pi for now, but soon we'll have that switched out with a laptop. I can't wait!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future improvements&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of things I want to change. I want the board to also support audio, with an integrated amp. Perhaps even a tube amp? I just think it would be funny. And being able to read input from the controls would be cool too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the software side, I want double or triple buffering. I actually got them both working, although they didn't play nice with the deltas that GUD sends over the wire. There are workarounds to this that I haven't implemented yet. It would also be nice to give GUD the ability to disable these deltas; perhaps that would be a good feature for me to add to the kernel module. Writing some documentation on the GUD protocol could be good too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a really fun project, and it's not over yet, but I think all the hard stuff is pretty much done (although - I've thought that before!). I really wasn't expecting this to take as long as it did, but I learned so much, and I'm a stronger engineer for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Source code&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a few repositories of interest:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardware lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, the original software for the RP2040 lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My very messy DAC equations live here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Nix GUD gadget attempt lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a fair bit of scratch code while learning (such as for my kernel module), but I don't think any of it was worth putting it in my Git forge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How we built a real-world benchmark for AI code review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog reflects a collaborative effort by Qodo’s research team to design, build and validate the benchmark and this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog introduces the Qodo’s code review benchmark 1.0, a rigorous methodology developed to objectively measure and validate the performance of AI-powered code review systems, including Qodo Git Code Review. We address critical limitations in existing benchmarks, which primarily rely on backtracking from fix commits to buggy commits, thereby narrowly focusing on bug detection while neglecting essential code quality and best-practice enforcement. Furthermore, previous methods often utilize isolated buggy commits instead of simulating a complete pull request (PR) review scenario on genuine, merged PRs, and are constrained by a small scale of PRs and issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our research establishes a new standard by intentionally injecting defects into genuine, merged pull requests sourced from active, production-grade open-source repositories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This novel approach is uniquely designed to simultaneously evaluate both code correctness (bug detection) and code quality (best practice enforcement) within a realistic code review context and at a significantly larger scale – 100 PRs containing a total of 580 issues. In a comparative evaluation pitting the Qodo model against 7 other leading AI code review platforms, Qodo demonstrated superior performance, achieving an F1 score of 60.1% for reliably identifying this diverse set of defects. The benchmark, including tools evaluated reviews, is publicly available in our benchmark GitHub organization. The following sections detail our benchmark creation methodology, experimental setup, comparative results, and key takeaways from this evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Related work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there are many benchmarks for AI code generation and bug fixing, SWE‑Bench being the most well-known, the code review domain has historically lacked robust evaluation datasets. Greptile made an important first step by creating a benchmark based on backtracking from fix commits, measuring whether AI tools could catch historically fixed bugs. Augment also used this approach to evaluate several AI code review tools. These methods are effective at spotting real bugs but are limited in scale, often only a single bug per commit review, and do not capture the size, complexity, or context of full pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qodo takes a different approach by starting with real, merged PRs and injecting multiple issues, including both functional bugs and best-practice violations. This enables the creation of larger, more realistic benchmarks for testing AI tools in system-level code review scenarios, capturing not just correctness but also code quality and compliance. By combining larger-scale PRs with dual-focus evaluation, Qodo provides a more comprehensive and practical benchmark than prior work, reflecting the full spectrum of challenges encountered in real-world code review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qodo Code Review Benchmark is constructed through a multi-stage process of injecting complex and non-obvious defects into real-world, merged pull requests (PRs) from active open-source repositories. This controlled injection approach is fundamentally designed to simultaneously evaluate both core objectives of a successful code review: code correctness (issues detection) and code quality (best practice enforcement). This integrated design allows us to create the first comprehensive benchmark that measures the full spectrum of AI code review performance, moving beyond traditional evaluations that focus mostly on isolated bug types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, this injection-based methodology is inherently scalable and repository-agnostic. Because the process operates on real merged PRs and extracts repository-specific best practices before injection, the benchmark generation can be applied to large volumes of PRs and to any codebase, open-source or private. This makes the framework a general mechanism for generating, high-quality code review evaluation data at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The benchmark repositories were strategically chosen to create a realistic, system-level code review environment. The core selection criteria focused on two aspects: 1) System-Level Code: Projects are production-grade, multi-component systems (e.g., server logic, FE, DB, API) that reflect the complexity of enterprise pull requests involving cross-module changes and architectural concerns. 2) Language Diversity: The set intentionally spans diverse technology stacks and ecosystems. including TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, C, C#, Rust, and Swift.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repository Analysis and Rule Extraction: We first analyze each target repository to collect and formalize a set of best practice rules. These rules are carefully curated to align with the repository’s current coding standards, style guides, and contribution guidelines, extracted from documentation and full code base analysis using an Agent-based parsing process and human validation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PR Collection &amp;amp; Filtering: PRs from targeted open-source repositories are collected via the GitHub API and subjected to strict technical filters (e.g., 3+ files, 50-15,000 lines changed, recently merged). To ensure the highest quality of ‘clean’ code for injection, we exclusively select PRs that were merged without subsequent reverts or immediate followup fix commits. After identifying all quality candidates, we validate that the selected PRs align with the extracted best practice rules before any compliance issues are injected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Violation Injection (Compliance Stage): compliance violations are injected into each filtered, compliant PR using an LLM, corrupting the diff while preserving the original functionality.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issues Injection (Additional Bugs Stage): an additional 1-3 functional/logical bugs are injected. These issues span various categories, including logical errors, edge case failures, race conditions, resource leaks, and improper error handling, creating a final benchmark instance with multiple, simultaneous defects for AI models to detect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ground Truth Validation: Following all injection steps, we perform a double verification of all modified PRs. Any additional, naturally occurring subtle issues or best practice violations found during this final check are manually added to the ground truth list, ensuring the benchmark’s accuracy and comprehensive coverage of realistic defects.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Set up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evaluation setup was designed to closely mirror a production development environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repository Environment: All benchmarked pull requests (PRs) were opened on a clean, forked repository. Prior to opening the PRs, we ensured that the repository-specific best practice rules, formalized in an AGENTS.md file, were committed to the root directory, making them accessible to all participating tools for compliance checks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configuration: Each of the 7 evaluated code review tools was configured using its default settings to automatically trigger a review upon PR submission.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execution &amp;amp; Validation: All benchmark PRs were systematically opened. We monitored all tools to confirm they ran without errors, re-triggering reviews when necessary to ensure complete coverage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Collection: Inline comments generated by each tool were meticulously collected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance Measurement: The collected findings, inline comments generated by each tool, were rigorously compared against our validated ground truth using an LLM-as-a-judge system. The core metrics calculated are defined as follows: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hit Definition: An inline comment generated by a tool is classified as a “Hit” (True Positive) if two criteria are met: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The comment text accurately describes the underlying issue&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The localization (the file and line number reference) is correct and points to the source of the issue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;False Positive (FP): A comment is classified as a False Positive if it does not correspond to any issue in the ground truth list.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;False Negative (FN): An issue from the ground truth list is classified as a False Negative if no tool-generated comment meets the criteria of a “Hit” for that specific issue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Recall: Calculated as the rate of ground truth issues recognized by the tool.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Precision: Calculated as the rate of tool-generated comments that correctly correspond to a ground truth issue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;F1 Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hit Definition: An inline comment generated by a tool is classified as a “Hit” (True Positive) if two criteria are met: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results reveal a clear and consistent pattern across tools. While several agents achieve very high precision, this comes at the cost of extremely low recall, meaning they identify only a small fraction of the actual issues present in the PRs. In practice, these tools are conservative: they flag only the most obvious problems to avoid false positives, but miss a large portion of subtle, system-level, and best-practice violations. This behavior inflates precision while severely limiting real review coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qodo, in contrast, demonstrates the highest recall by a significant margin, while still maintaining competitive precision, resulting in the best overall F1 score. This indicates that Qodo is able to detect a much broader portion of the ground-truth issues without overwhelming the user with noise. Importantly, precision is a dimension that can be tuned post-processing according to user preference (e.g., stricter filtering of findings), whereas recall is fundamentally constrained by the system’s ability to deeply understand the codebase, cross-file dependencies, architectural context, and repository-specific standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; For Qodo, we report results for two operating configurations: Qodo Precise, which reports only issues that clearly require developer action, and Qodo Exhaustive, which is optimized for maximum coverage and recall. Notably, both configurations achieve higher F1 scores than all competing tools in this evaluation. The results reveal a clear and consistent pattern across tools.

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Selected repositories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The selected repositories span a broad and representative distribution of programming languages and system disciplines, covering full-stack web applications, distributed systems, databases, developer platforms, runtime infrastructures, and mobile applications, with complexity profiles ranging from single-language projects (redis in C, tauri in Rust) to polyglot systems (dify with Python/Go, aspnetcore with C#/JavaScript), making them well-suited candidates for code review benchmarking across different paradigms while reflecting the diversity of real-world codebases encountered in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;DEEP DIVE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why More Companies Are Recognizing the Benefits of Keeping Older Employees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By Annie Coleman&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although age bias is still the norm, the value-add of longtime, experienced workers is beginning to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of Macclesfield, in northwest England, a branch of the UK home-improvement retailer B&amp;amp;Q quietly overturned one of corporate life’s most persistent assumptions. Faced with high staff turnover and uneven customer satisfaction, the company tried a simple experiment: In 1989, it staffed the store largely with older workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results were striking, according to one study. Profits rose 18 percent. Staff turnover fell to a fraction of the company average. Absenteeism dropped sharply. An experiment that started more than 30 years ago reshaped how the retailer approached age inclusiveness and led B&amp;amp;Q to open training to all ages and feature older workers in advertising, treating experience as an advantage rather than a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2007, BMW began implementing 70 ergonomic, low-cost improvements in a specialized assembly line in Dingolfing, Germany, to provide better conditions for its many older and middle-aged workers. Key changes included adjustable-height workstations, improved lighting and specialized stools, resulting in a 7 percent productivity increase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that similar age-performance dynamics are not limited to the quirks of retail or to the factory floor and are increasingly relevant as declining birth rates and artificial intelligence investments reduce the inflow of entry-level workers. A white paper from Bank of America’s Workplace Benefits group argues that recruiting and retaining older workers is becoming increasingly important as populations age, framing age-inclusive benefits not as accommodation, but as a driver of organizational performance, especially for roles where judgment, experience and decision quality matter most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The retention of these older workers is an idea that is becoming much more well-received,” says Cynthia Hutchins, Bank of America’s inaugural director of financial gerontology. Hutchins has been involved in implementing a workforce longevity policy that includes hybrid schedules, financial planning benefits, menopause support, grandparents’ leave and sabbaticals. “It’s almost a business imperative to institute those types of benefits” to retain older workers and attract younger ones, adds Hutchins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet initiatives such as these are rarely framed as strategy or as signals of a deeper shift. Most corporations continue to design careers as if effectiveness peaks early — as if speed, stamina and innovation belong exclusively to the young. If experience improves outcomes, why are so many organizations structured to push people out just as their value peaks?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If experience improves outcomes, why are so many organizations structured to push people out just as their value peaks?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Albatross or the Wise Man&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of corporate resistance lies a fundamental disagreement about value. Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi framed the debate in Aging and the Productivity Puzzle, a 2018 analysis delineating two schools of thought. The “albatross theory” holds that workers above the age of 65 drag down productivity due to resistance to change and outdated skills. The “wise man theory” tells a different story: of workers who possess judgment, institutional knowledge, emotional intelligence and expertise that younger employees cannot replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zandi and his colleagues analyzed state-level ADP data in the U.S. and concluded that post-retirement-age workers slowed wage growth and productivity, largely because they tend to be averse to adopting new technologies. Yet several major institutions reject the idea that older workers are a productivity “albatross” — and most look at the effects, not of those above the age of 65, but of the 50-plus age workforce, often the first in line for layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More recent research from AARP and the OECD shows that firms with more 50-plus workers are more productive, not less: a 10-percentage-point increase in older workers is associated with roughly 1.1 percent higher productivity. The 2020 OECD analysis also finds that age-balanced firms benefit from lower turnover and stronger team performance, driven by experience and knowledge sharing rather than technology resistance. Similarly, a 2022 study from Boston Consulting Group found that cross-generational teams outperform homogeneous ones when older workers’ judgment and mentoring are combined with younger workers’ digital skills. A 2022 meta analysis also pushes back against the idea that older workers are less effective, and found that teams perform better when members have a long tenure at the company, irrespective of workers’ ages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Zandi says that the value of older workers may depend on how AI in the workplace unfolds and what impact it has on productivity growth. “If AI turns out to be a bust or doesn’t live up to expectations, and you have other demographic forces that are restraining labor growth, then I think older workers should fare well,” Zandi says. He notes that so far, older workers have “navigated things reasonably gracefully,” while younger workers and mid-level managers are so far taking the brunt of AI-related impacts. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;People Peak Later Than We Think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Population aging is often treated as a future problem, something to be managed later with technology or policy tweaks. In reality, it is already reshaping labor markets in the U.S. and across advanced economies. Birth rates are lower, people are living longer and the share of workers above the age of 50 is rising steadily. This is not a forecast. It is arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Across advanced economies, there appears to be a persistent pattern of early exits that are less about individual choice than organizational design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet organizational assumptions about performance have not kept pace. Modern careers are still built around the idea that effectiveness peaks early. Recent research challenges that view. A 2025 study in the journal Intelligence, analyzing age trajectories across 16 cognitive, emotional and personality dimensions, finds that while processing speed does decline after early adulthood, many of the capabilities most relevant to complex work continue to improve well into midlife. When these traits are combined into a composite measure of overall functioning, performance peaks between ages 55 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if proficiency increasingly peaks in late midlife, then why are so many careers ending before they can be fully realized? Across advanced economies, there appears to be a persistent pattern of early exits that are less about individual choice than organizational design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., analysis by the Urban Institute of survey data of older workers from 1992 to 2016 showed that more than half above the age of 50 were pushed out of long-held jobs before they chose to retire, often through layoffs or restructuring rather than performance issues. The 2018 study — along with reporting from ProPublica — found that few ever regained comparable pay or responsibility, and hiring practices reinforced the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fact that more than half of U.S. workers above the age of 50 leave long-held jobs for reasons unrelated to performance and before they choose to retire is a systemic design failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bill Greene, a longtime business consultant, is an exception to this layoff trend. Hired at 64 as principal of Mind Share Partners, a nonprofit in San Francisco, he advises companies on the importance of creating mentally healthy environments, and cautions that the workplace is a minefield of biases — and that ageism cuts both ways for older workers and younger workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greene advises employers to be aware of the blind spots and inconsistencies. In the technology industry, he says, “it’s widely perceived that if you are 45 years old or over, you are a dinosaur,” yet in politics, “you can be 70, 75, 80, 85, and apparently that’s OK.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experience helps in an emergency. When the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, Greene was consulting for a financial services firm, and he saw firsthand how worried his client was that younger employees were going to panic and quit because they hadn’t been through a crisis of that magnitude before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They realized that they had to coach their younger employees,” he says, comparing the pandemic to the 2008 financial crash to help the client’s staff understand the risks and path forward. “That kind of wisdom and experience can come with more depth of understanding and perspective from an older employee than from a younger one,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Small-Scale Experiments Miss an Urgent Challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although several Fortune 500 companies have advertised their interest in hiring and retaining older workers, corporate commitments remain tentative and small-scale. UK-based Unilever launched its U-Work program in 2019, and now offers employees in nine countries a hybrid between traditional employment and gig work: a monthly retainer, benefits and freedom to choose which projects they work on and when. Workers can scale back hours, pursue other interests or transition gradually toward retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The program is innovative and, by all accounts, successful. Half of participants are above the age of 50. But only 140 employees out of Unilever’s 150,000-strong global workforce participate. This raises a question: Are these strategies of genuine transformation or sophisticated public relations?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three converging forces make the case for urgency. First, premature exit creates value leakage. The fact that more than half of U.S. workers above the age of 50 leave long-held jobs for reasons unrelated to performance and before they choose to retire is a systemic design failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the demand-side blind spot. Globally, spending by people above the age of 55 is projected to approach $15 trillion annually by the end of this decade, making older consumers one of the largest and fastest-growing sources of demand in the world economy. Yet many companies treat older customers as peripheral.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are exceptions. Alan Patricof, now 91 and still investing, launched Primetime Partners at 85 after observing that venture capital remained focused on millennials, despite obvious unmet demand among older adults. His fund has invested in more than 35 companies serving what he calls the “ageless market.” Consumer brands are adapting, too — L’Oréal has repositioned itself around longevity and healthy aging, treating later life as aspiration rather than decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The silver economy is not a niche. It is one of the largest and least contested growth opportunities of the next decade — and one that many firms still underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, longer working lives are inevitable. In Europe and the UK, effective retirement ages have been climbing, driven in part by financial need and policy changes. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the shift from defined-benefit to defined-contribution retirement plans incentivizes workers to remain employed longer. Organizations that fail to retain experienced talent will face labor shortages, while competitors benefit from workers who bring judgment, stability and institutional memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Role of Investors, C-Suites and Boards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mismatch between demographic reality and corporate behavior is beginning to register with long-term investors. Large asset managers increasingly frame longevity as a structural economic force with implications for growth, productivity and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Vanguard study, The Economics of a Graying World, highlights aging and slower labor-force growth as a persistent drag on economic expansion, arguing that longer working lives are one of the few viable adjustment mechanisms. From this perspective, workforce age policy becomes financially material, not optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When organizations push experienced workers out early, they forfeit peak judgment, execution capability and mentoring capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economist Andrew J. Scott of the London Business School argues in his 2024 book The Longevity Imperative that if societies see longevity primarily as an “aging problem” of more pensioners, higher health costs and fewer workers, longer lives risk becoming a fiscal drag. But if they invest in health, skills and age‑inclusive work, longevity can instead raise growth, employment and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One hurdle to this shift in perspective is an ongoing lack of transparency and accountability by employers. Ageism in hiring, promotion and redundancy remains widespread, yet unlike gender or ethnicity, workforce age is rarely disclosed or scrutinized. The result is a growing governance gap. Misalignment with demographic reality creates execution risk — in talent, productivity and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The case for a longevity strategy is ultimately an economic one. When organizations push experienced workers out early, they forfeit peak judgment, execution capability and mentoring capacity. When they underinvest in older consumers, they leave vast pools of demand underserved. Value is forfeited on both sides of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In meeting their responsibility for long-term risk and growth, companies should begin with clarity. Map the age profile of the workforce by role and seniority. Identify where people in their fifties and early sixties are exiting — and whether those exits reflect performance or design. Treat age as a strategic variable in the same way firms now treat gender, skills or succession risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From there, redesign follows. Build roles and career paths that assume longer working lives. Invest in mid- and late-career reskilling, not as remediation but as renewal. Structure intergenerational teams deliberately, so experience and speed compound rather than collide. Align product, service and brand strategy with the realities of an aging, wealthier customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this is about altruism. It is about reclaiming value currently being left on the table. As populations age, companies that learn to retain experience and serve longevity-driven demand will not just adapt — they will outperform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;OpenClaw is What Apple Intelligence Should Have Been&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something strange is happening with Mac Minis. They’re selling out everywhere, and it’s not because people suddenly need more coffee table computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you browse Reddit or HN, you’ll see the same pattern: people are buying Mac Minis specifically to run AI agents with computer use. They’re setting up headless machines whose sole job is to automate their workflows. OpenClaw—the open-source framework that lets you run Claude, GPT-5, or whatever model you want to actually control your computer—has become the killer app for Mac hardware. Not Final Cut. Not Logic. An AI agent that clicks buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly what Apple Intelligence should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple had everything: the hardware, the ecosystem, the reputation for “it just works.” They could have shipped an agentic AI that actually automated your computer instead of summarizing your notifications. Imagine if Siri could genuinely file your taxes, respond to emails, or manage your calendar by actually using your apps, not through some brittle API layer that breaks every update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They could have charged $500 more per device and people would have paid it. The margins would have been obscene. And they would have won the AI race not by building the best model, but by being the only company that could ship an AI you’d actually trust with root access to your computer. That trust—built over decades—was their moat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why didn’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe they just didn’t see it. That sounds mundane, but it’s probably the most common reason companies miss opportunities. When you’re Apple, you’re thinking about chip design, manufacturing scale, and retail strategy. An open-source project letting AI agents control computers might not ping your radar until it’s already happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or maybe they saw it and decided the risk wasn’t worth it. If you’re Apple, you don’t want your AI agent automatically buying things, posting on social media, or making irreversible decisions. The liability exposure would be enormous. Better to ship something safe and limited than something powerful and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s another dynamic at play. Look at who’s about to get angry about OpenClaw-style automation: LinkedIn, Facebook, anyone with a walled garden and a careful API strategy. These services depend on friction. They want you to use their app, see their ads, stay in their ecosystem. An AI that can automate away that friction is an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Apple had built this, they’d be fighting Instagram over ToS violations by Tuesday. They’d be testifying in front of Congress about AI agents committing fraud. Every tech platform would be updating their terms to explicitly ban Apple Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By letting some third party do it, Apple gets plausible deniability. They’re just selling hardware. Not their fault what people run on it. It’s the same strategy that made them billions in the App Store while maintaining they’re “not responsible for what developers do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think this is short-term thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what people miss about moats: they compound. The reason Microsoft dominated PCs wasn’t just that they had the best OS. It’s that everyone built for Windows, which made Windows more valuable, which made more people build for Windows. Network effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Apple owned the agent layer, they could have created the most defensible moat in tech. Because an AI agent gets better the more it knows about you. And Apple already has all your data, all your apps, all your devices. They could have built an agent that works across your iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Watch seamlessly—something no one else can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, they could have owned the API. Want your service to work with Apple Agent? You play by Apple’s rules. Suddenly Apple isn’t fighting with platforms—they’re the platform that platforms need to integrate with. It’s the App Store playbook all over again, but for the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mac Mini rush is a preview of this future. People want agents. They want automation. They want to pay for it. They’re literally buying extra computers just to run someone else’s AI on Apple’s hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple is getting the hardware revenue but missing the platform revenue. That might look smart this quarter. But platform revenue is what built Apple into a $3 trillion company. And platforms are what create trillion-dollar moats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect ten years from now, people will look back at 2024-2025 as the moment Apple had a clear shot at owning the agent layer and chose not to take it. Not because they couldn’t build it—they obviously could—but because they were optimizing for this year’s legal risk instead of next decade’s platform power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people buying Mac Minis to run AI agents aren’t just early adopters. They’re showing Apple exactly what product they should have built. Whether Apple is paying attention is another question entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A few CPU hardware bugs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catherine (Whitequark)’s recent observations on poorly-engineered firmware reminded me of a few mistakes I’ve seen in vendors’ CPUs; some unimportant and others surprisingly bad. Since I’ve never seen these widely discussed, here’s some discussion and links to supporting evidence to make them more widely known, since I think they’re interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intel’s misspelled CPUIDs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m aware of two situations where Intel have sold CPUs that report misspelled names in some of the strings returned by the &lt;code&gt;CPUID&lt;/code&gt; instruction. This seems embarrassing for an organization of Intel’s size, but probably doesn’t hurt anybody’s ability to use the CPUs in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GenuineIotel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A web search for “GenuineIotel” reveals some discussions regarding this apparent typo, where some processors such as the Xeon E3-1231 v3 return the string “GenuineIotel” (instead of the usual “GenuineIntel”) for the CPU manufacturer ID. This one is well-known enough to be mentioned in the list of manufacturer IDs on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible this misspelling is actually caused by some kind of random bit error, since the characters ’n’ and ‘o’ differ by only one bit; an unpredictable error that sets that bit could change &lt;code&gt;GenuineIntel&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;GenuineIotel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ore i5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another error that seems more likely to be human error in the CPU is in the Core i5-1245U CPU, which returns a processor brand string &lt;code&gt;Intel(R) ore(TM) i5-1245U&lt;/code&gt; which is simply missing the ‘C’ in &lt;code&gt;Core(TM) i5&lt;/code&gt;. Web searches for “Intel(R) ore(TM)” show a number of results which could be errors introduced by non-technical users attempting to copy down text from their screen when asking for tech support, but the Ubuntu certified configuration of the Dell Latitude 5430 with this CPU attests to this error actually being present in at least some machines using that CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible this misspelling is not part of the physical CPU design and is instead part of the system firmware because at least on many AMD CPUs the CPU name is normally set by the system firmware. Probably either the CPU design or its microcode encode this misspelling, or Intel’s firmware package that vendors use is the ultimate source. In either case, it seems embarrassing for them that such an error made it out into machines purchased by members of the public because it seems very likely to be the result of human error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ITE’s pipeline bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is an actual hardware bug that I discovered at work, but in an embedded processor which most people will never see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ITE Tech is a Taiwanese chip company that sells a variety of specialized ICs, including a selection of PC embedded controllers (which are used for tasks like making the keyboard work and managing battery charging in most laptops). IT81202 is one of those, with on-chip peripherals for communicating with an x86 processor and plenty of memory for private use by its RISC-V CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out there’s a pipeline bug in the IT81202 CPU, where instructions modifying some registers immediately following a multiply (&lt;code&gt;mul&lt;/code&gt; instruction) may have no effect. The workaround for this is to cripple the system, telling your compiler that the CPU doesn’t support multiplication or division instructions. Some of the performance can be regained by providing implementations of the library functions that provide integer multiply/divide operations that work in terms of the &lt;code&gt;mul&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; instructions, which works because inserting no-op instructions after them prevents the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, this issue doesn’t seem as embarrassing as Intel’s wrong CPUIDs. Pipelined CPUs are hard to build, and at the time they designed the IT81202 CPU RISC-V wasn’t widely used in industry yet so they probably had a pretty immature core implementation. In addition, that’s an embedded processor which very few people will ever need to write software for so an invasive workaround like that isn’t a big deal. This one seems more like a cautionary tale to be aware of than any reason to mock the vendor!&lt;/p&gt;
