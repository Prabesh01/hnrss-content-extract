  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How big a solar battery do I need to store *all* my home's electricity?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a modest set of solar panels on an entirely ordinary house in suburban London.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On average they generate about 3,800kWh per year. We also use about 3,800kWh of electricity each year. Obviously, we can't use all the power produced over summer and we need to buy power in winter. So here's my question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How big a battery would we need in order to be completely self-sufficient?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at a typical summer's day. The graph is a little complex, so I'll explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The yellow line shows solar production. It starts shortly after sunrise, peaks at midday, and gradually drops until sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The red line shows how much electricity our home is using. As you can see, there's a large peak about 19:00 when we cook dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blue line shows how much electricity we draw or export from the grid. From midnight until sunrise we import because the sun isn't shining. Once the sun has risen we're able to power our house and export to our neighbours. When we cook, we draw from the grid and our battery - which is why the evening grid peak is lower than the household use dip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CSV of the data looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Local_time&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Household_(W)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Solar_(W)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T08:25:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-187.76&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1166.77&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T08:30:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-227.04&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1193.25&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T08:35:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-253.06&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1222.84&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T08:40:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-266.87&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1245.18&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T08:45:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-450.8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1268.66&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T08:50:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-251.84&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1281.79&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T08:55:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-1426.26&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1306.93&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T09:00:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-206.78&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1341.37&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T09:05:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-215.52&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1390.9&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T09:10:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-242.6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1426.19&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2025-08-25T09:15:00.000+01:00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-246.84&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1473&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fairly trivial to sum both columns and subtract one from the other. That shows either the excess or deficit in solar power for the household.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On that day, the house used 9.7kWh and generated 19.6kWh. I'd need a 9.9kWh battery to store the excess right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because my usage doesn't track the sun, I'd actually need a 13kWh battery. That's the peak amount of excess electricity I've generated in that one day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I want to do is find out what the maximum size battery I would need in order to store all of summer's electricity for use in winter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily, I have several years of real data to go off! Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is based on data generated by my home battery. It has probes to measure solar output and grid flow. It is not 100% clock-accurate compared to my solar-panels' internal reporting nor what my smart-meter reports. I estimate a 1-2% deviation, which is good enough for these purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My energy usage isn't representative of anything other than my usage. Your household is probably different. I already have a 4.8kWh battery which changes how and when I use energy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn't account for gas heating or hot water. We have some electric heaters and taps which increases our electricity usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My maths is probably right - but the code is open source, so feel free to check for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, this is just a bit of fun. There's no practical way to build domestic batteries with this capacity using the technology of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tend to start generating more electricity than we use starting in Spring. So I've picked the end of March 2024 to the end of March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's see how big a battery we'd need to store our summer excess for winter. This finds the cumulative difference between each day's energy production and usage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; Python 3 import os
import pandas as pd

# Load all the CSVs
filepaths = [f for f in os.listdir(".") if f.endswith('.csv')]
df = pd.concat(map(pd.read_csv, filepaths))

# Make sure they're in order
df = df.sort_values("Timestamp")
df = df.reset_index(drop=True)

# Resolution is every 5 minutes, so divide by 12 to get hourly
df["Cumulative_Difference"] = ( (df["Household_(W)"] + df["Solar_(W)"] ).cumsum() ) / 12

# kWh of battery needed
int(df["Cumulative_Difference"].max() / 1000)

## Draw a pretty graph
df.plot(kind="line", x="Local_time", y="Cumulative_Difference", xlabel="Date", ylabel="MWh", xticks=["2024-04-01", "2024-05-01", "2024-05-01", "2024-06-01", "2024-07-01", "2024-08-01", "2024-09-01", "2024-10-01", "2024-11-01", "2024-12-01", "2025-01-01", "2025-02-01", "2025-03-01", "2025-04-01"], legend=False, grid=True, fontsize=15)
plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The total is 1,068KWh - basically, a MegaWatt-hour of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a quick graph to show how the storage would be used over the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, even in this scenario there are a few days where we'd need to import energy from the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is this sensible?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably not, no. It doesn't account for increased energy use from having an electric car or moving away from gas heating / cooking. As solar panels increase in efficiency, it might be more sensible to replace the panels on my roof, or add some onto a shed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The environmental impact of creating and storing such huge batteries could also be factored in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A battery which is only 100% full for a few days probably isn't an efficient design. Using wind, hydro, and other green sources from the grid might be preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, remember, this is an exercise in wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is this possible?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grid-scale batteries exist and they work brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if I wanted my own MegaWatt-hour of battery storage, it would probably cost me between £100k and half-a-million quid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn't include maintenance, the land, planning permission, and a hundred other things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But battery prices are falling fast. In the last decade lithium ion battery prices have fallen 90%. With new sodium ion batteries promising an even bigger drop - down to US$10/kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If - and it is a big if - those numbers came to pass, it would probably cost around £8,000 for a domestic battery. Basically the same cost as adding solar panels in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic solar works - yes, even in the rainy UK! It is relatively cheap, moves energy production as close as possible to energy consumption, reduces bill-shock, and means we don't have endless planning arguments about whether fields should be turned into solar farms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible that, not too long in the future, every home could also have a 1 MegaWatt-hour battery. They would be able to capture all the excess solar power generated in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a bright and sunny future where every home can be solar-self-sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are CubeSats. Satellites that are going to space—or at least, the ones I have here are prototypes. But these have one thing in common: they're all powered by either a Raspberry Pi, or a microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are already Pis in space, like on Mark Rober's SatGus, on GASPACS, and the Astro Pis on the Space station. Another Pi is going up this weekend, which is why I'm posting this today. I'll get to that one, but I wanted to spend some time talking about two things that fascinate me: Raspberry Pis, and putting them space!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What is a CubeSat&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Who builds and launches CubeSats&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How you can build your own CubeSat&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then for a bonus, in today's video, I interviewed two people helping students launch SilverSat into space (this weekend!), and a YouTuber who I've learned a lot from about track satellites (including CubeSats) from your own backyard!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of this post contains a lightly-edited transcript of the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let's dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's a CubeSat?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's a CubeSat? Well, it's in the name—it's a satellite that's a cube!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they don't have to be a cube, these smallest ones are '1U', or 10 x 10 x 10 centimeters. You can also find 2U CubeSats, like the taller Build a CubeSat, which is 20 centimeters tall. (Well, technically the current prototype is 1.5U).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SatGus, Mark Rober's satellite taking space selfies, is a whopping 12U! They needed all that extra space to fit a phone, a mechanism to deploy the phone, a camera to take the selfie, a Raspberry Pi to control the phone, and redundant systems for everything. They've already taken thousands of selfies, and SatGus has me beat. My best Pi might get to 3.4 Gigahertz, but the Pi on SatGus is whizzing through space at almost 17,000 miles per hour. That's 7,570 meters per second for everyone else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But back to CubeSats. Having standards means you can build off existing work for the hard things, like a space-rated Aluminum frame, or the complex EPS, or Electrical Power System board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you can add in custom parts, like a Pi to run experiments, a communications board with antennas and radios, cameras, sensors, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And these cubesats have normal screw-on antennas, but the way these things are deployed, you only get 10x10x10 centimeters—you can't have an antenna poking out the top. So they use cool things like flexible tape antennas that pop out once your CubeSat deploys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What else makes CubeSats cool?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, how about price? In the old days, you had to have like $10 million to build a satellite, and $60+ million to launch it into space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, you can build a space-ready CubeSat using a few thousand dollars of parts. Then you can launch it on a rideshare for... well, $85 grand. Which is a lot, but it's not $60 million-a-lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So most of us won't be launching one of these things into space, unless maybe you can get a grant. But that doesn't mean they're not useful to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who builds CubeSats?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like with many projects, I love these things for the challenge, the way they break some of my assumptions, like working with Raspberry Pis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're building a device that's less than 2 kilograms, has 1.8W of maximum continuous power draw, and needs to be operated remotely—even for just a month—you're immediately going to change your assumptions about how you build things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would hack Home Assistant onto a mini PC to monitor some sensors if I was feeling lazy—but that Mini PC would use an order of magnitude too much power for a CubeSat (much less the internal volume it would occupy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On CubeSats, every millimeter, and every milliAmp has to be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to me, CubeSats are like Swiss watches of modern electronics. How many sensors can you fit in one? How much throughput can you get on a tiny radio with a small antenna? Can you get enough power out of tiny solar cells to keep the main flight computer working? How do you control thermals without air? How do you design it so it can recover from a complete power loss?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every step of the way there are challenges; and that's before we even launch one! Someone who I think illustrates this best is Manuel, with his Build a CubeSat project. He's working on this Cubesat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He did a weather balloon launch this year, and he's documenting everything on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His first launch had many small problems. But also great learning, especially around redundancy and how to get the thing off the launch stand without problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you're not only dealing with hardware, but also with software. And software that, at its core, has to be remotely accessed. And not only remote, but also wireless, meaning anyone else on earth within range can access it too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you keep it secure? That's something Tim from Ethos Labs is also dealing with with this, his T.E.M.P.E.S.T. CubeSat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This thing is actually made to be not secure. It has intentional vulnerabilities, and he uses those to teach people different ways to make their CubeSats more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have complex hardware, running in limited space, with limited power and communications, and you want cram in as much functionality as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see where I'm going with this? That kind of problem is perfect for the microcontrollers and low-power SBCs that I love testing and playing with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except instead of me worrying about something consuming 10 watts, these guys are looking at a power budget of one watt. Or less!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These problems are hard. And not everyone has the patience for a completely custom project like Build a CubeSat, so there are also some small companies building kits to help you learn all these lessons with a little less stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like what hardware do you need for a 100% self-contained CubeSat? And how do you get it certified for flight on a SpaceX rocket?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your own CubeSat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I'll quickly cover two products that are meant for like STEM classroom education, one from the lower end, and one that's based on a CubeSat that just flew this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first one is the MySat Kit, that you can buy from MySat in Ukraine. It comes with a board powered by an ESP32 with a camera, light sensors, an LED, gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, clock, and a few other boards. And these are all off-the-shelf components you can buy replacements for or use 'em with other hardware, like a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way it's put together won't hold up on a rocket launch, but it's not meant for that. It's meant to show you how it's built, how you can communicate with it, and that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took like an hour to build, and once I put it together I tried flashing the flight control firmware with my Mac... but I ran into some issues with Arduino IDE, and that's a me problem and not so much a MySat problem. Plus the team behind it has a whole war going on that they've been dealing with, so I'll be patient and try getting it going later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MySat goes from like $130 for a basic kit where you 3D print your own frame, or up to $300 for a full kit including deployable solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the higher end, there's RASCube, and Edward Robinson, the 21 year old founder of Robinson Space, sent it over after he saw me posting about CubeSats online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RASCube comes from Australia, and Edward's mission is to teach students about space through hands-on building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just built this LS version of the cube last week; it's the little brother to their V2 design, which flew in space on a Falcon 9 rocket earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like MySat, you build the kit with an EPS board for power, a computer board with all the controls, and a radio board that ties in GPS and radio comms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RASCubes are a bit more expensive, coming in at around $430 each for the LB, and $600 each for the full aluminum V2s. But the price tag on that also covers full lesson plans and resources for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love these things—all the people I've talked to on this journey are motivated by the same thing: learning about space, electronics, and integrating hardware in a new way, and sharing what they learn with others, especially students.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CubeSat T.E.M.P.E.S.T. and Build a CubeSat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like take Build a Cubesat. For that project, everything is open source hardware, and every part of the journey is being documented on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I learned from the first flight test was how weird it is to have your Pi go from like overheating on the ground, to getting really cold as it goes higher, but then overheating again in the upper atmosphere because there's not enough air to dissipate heat!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You start to realize some of the crazy physical conditions you'll deal with on orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back down to earth, though, for CubeSat Tempest: the whole reason this exists is to help people learn why security is important, even for a tiny CubeSat. More importantly, Tim Fowler's course teaches people how to secure things like uplinks (see: the ground station pictured above) and flight control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are so many people like Tim, who work in their free time to try to teach about space, or engineering, or just small slices of things like security, using these tactile little cubes you can build and put next to your laptop on a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's crazy to think we're to a point where students can build these things, write flight control software, and even launch 'em into space!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that brings me to SilverSat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SilverSat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's another CubeSat with a Raspberry Pi onboard, and it's launching NET Sunday, at 6:11 p.m. Eastern time, aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. What does NET mean? Well, as I found out when I visited Florida this summer, that means "No Earlier Than", and in spaceflight, many things delay launches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The students who built SilverSat are no strangers to delays—they were originally supposed to see their CubeSat launch earlier this year, but the cargo module they were on got damaged during transport, and that delayed them for months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got to talk to two of the adults guiding the students on their first space launch, and I discussed the history of the project (it started up in 2017), how they are supported by NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative, the importance of amateur radio for CubeSats, and why they chose a Raspberry Pi Zero for their onboard computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That interview is tucked away in the last half of the video at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tracking Satellites from your backyard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also in that video, I spoke to Gabe from saveitforparts, and he mentioned it's not that difficult to listen in on satellites on orbit—including amateur CubeSats!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SilverSat will be broadcasting SSDV (Slow-Scan Digital Video) at set times, and the schedule for that should be posted on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the video embedded in this post (near the top), or Gabe's own channel for ideas for tracking satellites. It can be done with under $100 of equipment (usually just an SDR and a cheap antenna).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Infectious Enthusiasm for Learning (and Teaching)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like a broken record, but one thing I love, talking to anyone in the CubeSat community is this sense of infectious enthusiasm. And I was going to cut this video out for time, but watching it back, I realized other people would probably enjoy Tim showing off some neat CubeSats in his personal collection as much as I did. So I put up some bonus content on my second channel, Level 2 Jeff; you can watch another 8 minutes of CubeSat hardware below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who taught me about CubeSats for this video and blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;PayPal Ushers in a New Era of Peer-to-Peer Payments, Reimagining How Money Moves to Anyone, Anywhere&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Send and receive money as easily as sending a text, across apps, borders, and currencies &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- On the heels of the PayPal World announcement, a global platform connecting the world's largest digital payment systems and wallets, PayPal today introduced PayPal links, a new way to send and receive money through a personalized, one-time link that can be shared in any conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Creating personalized payment links | Click to Enlarge&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;PayPal users in the U.S. can begin creating personalized payment links today, with international expansion to the UK, Italy, and other markets starting later this month. By making payments this simple and universal, PayPal links helps drive new customer acquisition and brings more users into the PayPal ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The peer-to-peer (P2P) experience is about to go even further. Crypto will soon be directly integrated into PayPal's new P2P payment flow in the app. This will make it more convenient for PayPal users in the U.S. to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, PYUSD, and more, to PayPal, Venmo, as well a rapidly growing number of digital wallets across the world that support crypto and stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Expanding what people can do with PayPal also comes with reassurance around how personal payments are handled. As always, friends-and-family transfers through Venmo and PayPal are exempt from 1099-K reporting. Users won't receive tax forms for gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses, helping ensure that personal payments stay personal.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"For 25 years, PayPal has revolutionized how money moves between people. Now, we're taking the next major step," said Diego Scotti, General Manager, Consumer Group at PayPal. "Whether you're texting, messaging, or emailing, now your money follows your conversations. Combined with PayPal World, it's an unbeatable value proposition, showing up where people connect, making it effortless to pay your friends and family, no matter where they are or what app they're using."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;P2P is a cornerstone of PayPal's consumer experience, driving engagement and bringing more users into the ecosystem. P2P and other consumer total payment volume saw solid growth in the second quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year as the company focused on improving the experience and increasing user discoverability to make it easier than ever to move money globally. Plus, Venmo saw its highest TPV growth in three years. With PayPal World unlocking seamless interoperability, P2P is poised for even greater momentum in the future as PayPal and Venmo connect to billions of wallets worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How PayPal links work:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list type="disc" rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Create a personalized link – Open the PayPal app, enter the details of your payment or request, and generate a unique, one-time link to share.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Always the right person – Each link is private, one-time use, and created for a specific transaction.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Drop it anywhere – Send your link in a text, DM, email, or chat. Add a note, emoji, or payment note.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Manage payment activity: Unclaimed links expire after 10 days. Users can send a reminder or even cancel the payment or request before the link is claimed with the PayPal app.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Tap and done – The recipient taps the link and either completes or accepts the payment within the PayPal App with their PayPal account.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Funds are instant – the recipient will get immediate access to their funds with a PayPal Balance account once accepted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Video coming soon&lt;/div&gt;ACM UIST 2025&lt;lb/&gt;Frank Heyen, Marius Labudda, Michael Sedlmair, Andreas Fender&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, electric guitars are often used together with digital interfaces. For instance, tablature applications can support guitar practice by rendering and playing back the tabs of individual instrument tracks of a song (guitar, drums, etc.). However, those interfaces are typically controlled via mouse and keyboard or via touch input. This means that controlling and configuring playback during practice can lead to high switching costs, as learners often need to switch between playing and interface control. In this paper, we explore the use of audio input from an unmodified electric guitar to enable interface control without letting go of the guitar. We present GuitarPie, an audio-based pie menu interaction method. GuitarPie utilizes the grid-like structure of a fretboard to spatially represent audio-controlled operations, avoiding the need to memorize note sequences. Furthermore, we implemented TabCtrl, a tablature interface that uses GuitarPie and other audio-based interaction methods for interface control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM UIST 2024&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Mohamed Kari&lt;p&gt;Digital pen input devices based on absolute pen position sensing, such as a Wacom pen, support high-fidelity pen input. However, they require specialized sensing surfaces like drawing tablets, which can have a large desk footprint, constrain the possible input area, and limit mobility. In contrast, digital pens with integrated relative sensing enable mobile use on passive surfaces, but suffer from motion artifacts or require surface contact at all times, deviating from natural pen affordances. We present OptiBasePen, a device for mobile pen input on ordinary surfaces. Our prototype consists of two parts: the ``base'' on which the hand rests and the pen for fine-grained input. The base features a high-precision mouse sensor to sense its own relative motion, and two infrared image sensors to track the absolute pen tip position within the base's frame of reference. This enables pen input on ordinary surfaces without external cameras while also avoiding drift from pen micro-movements. In this work, we present our prototype as well as the general base+pen concept, which combines relative and absolute sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM UIST 2023&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Derek Alexander Witzig, Max Moebus, Christian Holz&lt;p&gt;When learning to play an instrument, it is crucial for the learner's muscles to be in a relaxed state when practicing. Identifying, which parts of a song lead to increased muscle tension requires self-awareness during an already cognitively demanding task. In this work, we investigate unobtrusive pressure sensing for estimating muscle tension while practicing songs with the guitar. First, we collected data from twelve guitarists. Our apparatus consisted of three pressure sensors (one on each side of the guitar pick and one on the guitar neck) to determine the sensor that is most suitable for automatically estimating muscle tension. Second, we extracted features from the pressure time series that are indicative of muscle tension. Third, we present the hardware and software design of our PressurePick prototype, which is directly informed by the data collection and subsequent analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM CHI 2023&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Thomas Roberts, Tiffany Luong, Christian Holz&lt;p&gt;Digital painting interfaces require an input fidelity that preserves the artistic expression of the user. Drawing tablets allow for precise and low-latency sensing of pen motions and other parameters like pressure to convert them to fully digitized strokes. A drawback is that those interfaces are rigid. While soft brushes can be simulated in software, the haptic sensation of the rigid pen input device is different compared to using a soft wet brush on paper. We present InfinitePaint, a system that supports digital painting in Virtual Reality on real paper with a real wet brush. We use special paper that turns black wherever it comes into contact with water and turns blank again upon drying. A single camera captures those temporary strokes and digitizes them while applying properties like color or other digital effects. We tested our system with artists and compared the subjective experience with a drawing tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM UIST 2022&lt;lb/&gt;Guy Luethi, Andreas Fender, Christian Holz&lt;p&gt;We present DeltaPen, a pen device that operates on passive surfaces without the need for external tracking systems or active sensing surfaces. DeltaPen integrates two adjacent lens-less optical flow sensors at its tip, from which it reconstructs accurate directional motion as well as yaw rotation. DeltaPen also supports tilt interaction using a built-in inertial sensor. A pressure sensor and high-fidelity haptic actuator complements our pen device while retaining a compact form factor that supports mobile use on uninstrumented surfaces. We present a processing pipeline that reliably extracts fine-grained pen translations and rotations from the two optical flow sensors. To asses the accuracy of our translation and angle estimation pipeline, we conducted a technical evaluation in which we compared our approach with ground-truth measurements of participants' pen movements during typical pen interactions. We conclude with several example applications that leverage our device's capabilities. Taken together, we demonstrate novel input dimensions with DeltaPen that have so far only existed in systems that require active sensing surfaces or external tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM CHI 2022&lt;lb/&gt;(Best paper award)&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Christian Holz&lt;lb/&gt; Additional links: [Full scenario] [Conference presentation] [Explainer video]&lt;p&gt;Mixed Reality is gaining interest as a platform for collaboration and focused work to a point where it may supersede current office settings in future workplaces. At the same time, we expect that interaction with physical objects and face-to-face communication will remain crucial for future work environments, which is a particular challenge in fully immersive Virtual Reality. In this work, we reconcile those requirements through a user's individual Asynchronous Reality, which enables seamless physical interaction across time. When a user is unavailable, e.g., focused on a task or in a call, our approach captures co-located or remote physical events in real-time, constructs a causality graph of co-dependent events, and lets immersed users revisit them at a suitable time in a causally accurate way. Enabled by our system AsyncReality, we present a workplace scenario that includes walk-in interruptions during a person's focused work, physical deliveries, and transient spoken messages. We then generalize our approach to a use-case agnostic concept and system architecture. We conclude by discussing the implications of an Asynchronous Reality for future offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM CHI 2021&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Diego Martinez Plasencia, Sriram Subramanian&lt;p&gt;Acoustic levitation is gaining popularity as an approach to create physicalized mid-air content by levitating different types of levitation primitives. Such primitives can be independent particles or particles that are physically connected via threads or pieces of cloth to form shapes in mid-air. However, initialization (i.e., placement of such primitives in their mid-air target locations) currently relies on either manual placement or specialized ad-hoc implementations, which limits their practical usage. We present ArticuLev, an integrated pipeline that deals with the identification, assembly and mid-air placement of levitated shape primitives. We designed ArticuLev with the physical properties of commonly used levitation primitives in mind. It enables experiences that seamlessly combine different primitives into meaningful structures (including fully articulated animated shapes) and supports various levitation display approaches (e.g., particles moving at high speed). In this paper, we describe our pipeline and demonstrate it with heterogeneous combinations of levitation primitives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

Current systems capture input with cameras, for which touch detection remains a core challenge, often leaving free-hand mid-air interaction and controllers as viable alternatives for input. We present TapID, a wrist-based system that complements optical hand tracking with inertial sensing to detect touch events on surfaces - the input modality that users have grown used to on phones and tablets. TapID embeds a pair of inertial sensors in a flexible strap, one at either side of the wrist; from the combination of registered signals, TapID reliably detects surface touch events and, more importantly, identifies the finger used for touch, which we fuse with optically tracked hand poses to trigger input in VR. We evaluated TapID in a series of user studies on event-detection accuracy (F1 = 0.997) and finger-identification accuracy (within-user: F1 = 0.93; cross-user: F1 = 0.91 after 10 refinement taps and F1 = 0.87 with no refinement) in a seated table scenario. We conclude with a series of applications that complement hand tracking with touch input, including UI control, rapid typing, and surface gestures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

In Virtual Reality, however, input is largely detected using cameras which does not nearly reach the fidelity we achieve with analog handwriting or the spatial resolution required to enable fine-grained on-surface input.&lt;lb/&gt;We present FlashPen, a digital pen for VR whose sensing principle affords accurately digitizing hand-writing and fine-grained 2D input for manipulation. We combine absolute camera tracking with relative motion sensing from an optical flow sensor. In this paper, we describe our prototype, a user study and several application prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

In manufacturing, systematically measuring products for quality assurance is often a manual task, where the primary challenge for the workers lies in accurately identifying positions to measure and correctly documenting these measurements. This paper focuses on a use-case, which involves metrology of small near-symmetrical objects, such as LEGO bricks. We aim to support this task through situated visual measurement guides. Aligning these guides poses a major challenge, since fine grained details, such as embossed logos, serve as the only feature by which to retrieve an object's unique orientation. We present a two-step approach, which consists of (1) locating and orienting the object based on its shape, and then (2) disambiguating the object's rotational symmetry based on small visual features. We apply and compare different deep learning approaches and discuss our guidance system in the context of our use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM ISS 2019&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Joerg Mueller&lt;p&gt;We present SpaceState, a system for designing spatial user interfaces that react to changes of the physical layout of a room. SpaceState uses depth cameras to measure the physical environment and allows designers to interactively define global and local states of the room. After designers defined states, SpaceState can identify the current state of the physical environment in real-time. This allows applications to adapt the content to room states and to react to transitions between states. Other scenarios include analysis and optimizations of work flows in physical environments. We demonstrate SpaceState by showcasing various example states and interactions. Lastly, we implemented an example application: A projection mapping based tele-presence application, which projects a remote user in the local physical space according to the current layout of the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM ISS 2018&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Joerg Mueller&lt;p&gt;We present Velt, a flexible framework for multi RGB-D camera systems. Velt supports modular real-time streaming and processing of multiple RGB, depth and skeleton streams in a camera network. RGB-D data from multiple devices can be combined into 3D data like point clouds. Furthermore, we present an integrated GUI, which enables viewing and controlling all streams, as well as debugging and profiling performance. The node-based GUI provides access to everything from high level parameters like frame rate to low level properties of each individual device. Velt supports modular preprocessing operations like downsampling and cropping of streaming data. Furthermore, streams can be recorded and played back. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of Velt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM CHI 2018&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, Philipp Herholz, Marc Alexa, Joerg Mueller&lt;p&gt;We present OptiSpace, a system for the automated placement of perspectively corrected projection mapping content. We analyze the geometry of physical surfaces and the viewing behavior of users over time using depth cameras. Our system measures user view behavior and simulates a virtual projection mapping scene users would see if content were placed in a particular way. OptiSpace evaluates the simulated scene according to perceptual criteria, including visibility and visual quality of virtual content. Finally, based on these evaluations, it optimizes content placement, using a two-phase procedure involving adaptive sampling and the covariance matrix adaptation algorithm. With our proposed architecture, projection mapping applications are developed without any knowledge of the physical layouts of the target environments. Applications can be deployed in different uncontrolled environments, such as living rooms and office spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;ACM UIST 2017&lt;lb/&gt;Andreas Fender, David Lindlbauer, Philipp Herholz, Marc Alexa, Joerg Mueller&lt;p&gt;We present HeatSpace, a system that records and empirically analyzes user behavior in a space and automatically suggests positions and sizes for new displays. The system uses depth cameras to capture 3D geometry and users' perspectives over time. To derive possible display placements, it calculates volumetric heatmaps describing geometric persistence and planarity of structures inside the space. It evaluates visibility of display poses by calculating a volumetric heatmap describing occlusions, position within users' field of view, and viewing angle. Optimal display size is calculated through a heatmap of average viewing distance. Based on the heatmaps and user constraints we sample the space of valid display placements and jointly optimize their positions. This can be useful when installing displays in multi-display environments such as meeting rooms, offices, and train stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

With MeetAlive, all participants may simultaneously display and share content from their personal laptop wirelessly anywhere in the room. MeetAlive gives each participant complete control over displayed content in the room. This is achieved by a perspective corrected mouse cursor that transcends the boundary of the laptop screen to position, resize, and edit their own and others' shared content. MeetAlive includes features to replicate content views to ensure that all participants may see the actions of other participants even as they are seated around a conference table. We report on observing six groups of three participants who worked on a collaborative task with minimal assistance. Participants' feedback highlighted the value of MeetAlive features for multi-user engagement in meetings involving brainstorming and content creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

Creature Teacher's generic approach makes it possible to animate rigged 3D models with nearly arbitrary topology (e.g., non-humanoid) without requiring specialized user-to-character mappings or predefined movements. We use a bimanual interaction paradigm, allowing users to select parts of the model with one hand and manipulate them with the other hand. Cyclic movements of body parts during manipulation are detected and repeatedly played back - also while animating other body parts. Our approach of taking cyclic movements as an input makes mode switching between recording and playback obsolete and allows for fast and seamless creation of animations. We show that novice users with no animation background were able to create expressive cyclic animations for initially static virtual 3D creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;TVCG 2024&lt;lb/&gt;Lara Lenz, Andreas Fender, Julia Chatain, Christian Holz&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous digital communication is a widely applied and well-known form of information exchange. Most pieces of technology make use of some variation of asynchronous communication systems, be it messaging or email applications. This allows recipients to process digital messages immediately (synchronous) or whenever they have time (asynchronous), meaning that purely digital interruptions can be mitigated easily. Mixed Reality systems have the potential to not only handle digital interruptions but also interruptions in physical space, e.g., caused by co-workers in workspaces or learning environments. However, the benefits of such systems previously remained untested in the context of Mixed Reality. We conducted a user study (N=26) to investigate the impact that the timing of task delivery has on the participants' performance, workflow, and emotional state. Participants had to perform several cognitively demanding tasks in a Mixed Reality workspace. Inside the virtual workspace, we simulated in-person task delivery either during tasks (i.e., interrupting the participant) or between tasks (i.e., delaying the interruption). Our results show that delaying interruptions has a significant impact on subjective metrics like the perceived performance and workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

        &lt;cell class="pubdesc"&gt;TVCG 2023&lt;lb/&gt;Tiffany Luong, Yi Fei Cheng, Max Moebus, Andreas Fender, Christian Holz&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality (VR) systems have traditionally required users to operate the user interface with controllers in mid-air. More recent VR systems, however, integrate cameras to track the headset's position inside the environment as well as the user's hands when possible. This allows users to directly interact with virtual content in mid-air just by reaching out, thus discarding the need for hand-held physical controllers. However, it is unclear which of these two modalities—controller-based or free-hand interaction—is more suitable for efficient input, accurate interaction, and long-term use under reliable tracking conditions. While interacting with hand-held controllers introduces weight, it also requires less finger movement to invoke actions (e.g., pressing a button) and allows users to hold on to a physical object during virtual interaction. In this paper, we investigate the effect of VR input modality (controller vs. free-hand interaction) on physical exertion, agency, task performance, and motor behavior across two mid-air interaction techniques (touch, raycast) and tasks (selection, trajectory-tracing). Participants reported less physical exertion, felt more in control, and were faster and more accurate when using VR controllers compared to free-hand interaction in the raycast setting. Regarding personal preference, participants chose VR controllers for raycast but free-hand interaction for mid-air touch. Our correlation analysis revealed that participants' physical exertion increased with selection speed, quantity of arm motion, variation in motion speed, and bad postures, following ergonomics metrics such as consumed endurance and rapid upper limb assessment. We also found a negative correlation between physical exertion and the participant's sense of agency, and between physical exertion and task accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

Tables afford more ergonomic postures and provide opportunities for rest, which raises the question of whether they may also benefit prolonged interaction in Virtual Reality (VR). In this paper, we investigate the effects of tabletop surface presence in situated VR settings on task performance, behavior, and subjective experience. In an empirical study, 24 participants performed two tasks (selection, docking) on virtual interfaces placed at two distances and two orientations. Our results show that a physical tabletop inside VR improves comfort, agency, and task performance while decreasing physical exertion and strain of the neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist, assessed through objective metrics and subjective reporting. Notably, we found that these benefits apply when the UI is placed on and aligned with the table itself as well as when it is positioned vertically in mid-air above it. Our experiment therefore provides empirical evidence for integrating physical table surfaces into VR scenarios to enable and support prolonged interaction. We conclude by discussing the effective usage of surfaces in situated VR experiences and provide initial guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

While this is adequate to support user input, it unfortunately limits users' virtual representations to just their upper bodies. Current systems thus resort to floating avatars, whose limitation is particularly evident in collaborative settings. To estimate full-body poses from the sparse input sources, prior work has incorporated additional trackers and sensors at the pelvis or lower body, which increases setup complexity and limits practical application in mobile settings. In this paper, we present AvatarPoser, the first learning-based method that predicts full-body poses in world coordinates using only motion input from the user's head and hands. Our method builds on a Transformer encoder to extract deep features from the input signals and decouples global motion from the learned local joint orientations to guide pose estimation. To obtain accurate full-body motions that resemble motion capture animations, we refine the arm joints' positions using an optimization routine with inverse kinematics to match the original tracking input. In our evaluation, AvatarPoser achieved new state-of-the-art results in evaluations on large motion capture datasets (AMASS). At the same time, our method's inference speed supports real-time operation, providing a practical interface to support holistic avatar control and representation for Metaverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

As users increasingly type on the go, text input on mobile and wearable devices has had to compromise on full-size typing. In this paper, we present TapType, a mobile text entry system for full-size typing on passive surfaces—without an actual keyboard. From the inertial sensors inside a band on either wrist, TapType decodes and relates surface taps to a traditional QWERTY keyboard layout. The key novelty of our method is to predict the most likely character sequences by fusing the finger probabilities from our Bayesian neural network classifier with the characters’ prior probabilities from an n-gram language model. In our online evaluation, participants on average typed 19 words per minute with a character error rate of 0.6% after 30 minutes of training. Expert typists thereby consistently achieved more than 25 WPM at a similar error rate. We demonstrate applications of TapType in mobile use around smartphones and tablets, as a complement to interaction in situated Mixed Reality outside visual control, and as an eyes-free mobile text input method using an audio feedback-only interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

In this paper, we present TransforMR, a video see-through mixed reality system for mobile devices that performs 3D-pose-aware object substitution to create meaningful mixed reality scenes. In real-time and for previously unseen and unprepared real-world environments, TransforMR composes mixed reality scenes so that virtual objects assume behavioral and environment-contextual properties of replaced real-world objects. This yields meaningful, coherent, and humaninterpretable scenes, not yet demonstrated by today’s augmentation techniques. TransforMR creates these experiences through our novel pose-aware object substitution method building on different 3D object pose estimators, instance segmentation, video inpainting, and pose-aware object rendering. TransforMR is designed for use in the real-world, supporting the substitution of humans and vehicles in everyday scenes, and runs on mobile devices using just their monocular RGB camera feed as input. We evaluated TransforMR with eight participants in an uncontrolled city environment employing different transformation themes. Applications of TransforMR include real-time character animation analogous to motion capturing in professional film making, however without the need for preparation of either the scene or the actor, as well as narrative-driven experiences that allow users to explore fictional parallel universes in mixed reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

Users simply grasp virtual objects and mimic their desired physical movement. The physical properties required to fulfill that movement will then be inferred directly from that motion. We provide a 3D user interface that does not require users to have an abstract model of physical properties. Our approach leverages users' real world experiences with physics. We conducted a bodystorming to investigate users' mental model of physics. Based on our iterative design process, we implemented techniques for inferring mass, bounciness and friction. We conducted a case study with 15 participants with varying levels of physics education. The results indicate that users are capable of demonstrating the required interactions and achieve satisfying results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple has a private CSS property to add Liquid Glass effects to web content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have an incredibly boring summer hobby: looking at the changelog for the WebKit Github repo. Why? Because I spend a chunk of my professional life working with webviews inside mobile apps and I like to get an early peek into what's coming in the next version of iOS. Since Tim Cook has yet to stand up at WWDC and announce "one more thing... Service Worker support in WKWebView, provided you add the correct entry to the &lt;code&gt;WKAppBoundDomains&lt;/code&gt; array in your &lt;code&gt;Info.plist&lt;/code&gt;" (and you know what, he should) manual research is the order of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I was really interested to see, the day after WWDC finished, a pull request named:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[Materials] Rename "hosted blur" materials to reference "glass"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Liquid Glass was one of the big takeaways from 2025's WWDC. Probably the biggest change in iOS UI since iOS 7 ditched the skeuomorphic look of the past. But that's all native UI, what does any of that have to do with webviews?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A poke around the context of the PR revealed something really interesting: Apple has a custom CSS property named &lt;code&gt;-apple-visual-effect&lt;/code&gt; . Not only does it allow the use of Liquid Glass in iOS 26 (via values like &lt;code&gt;-apple-system-glass-material&lt;/code&gt;) but all versions support using standard materials with values like &lt;code&gt;-apple-system-blur-material-thin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Yes it works and no, we can't&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you, like me, fire up Safari and start editing some CSS, I have bad news: no, it doesn't work on the web. As well it shouldn't. But it also doesn't work by default in an app using WKWebView, you have to toggle a setting in WKPreferences called &lt;code&gt;useSystemAppearance&lt;/code&gt;... and it's private. So if you use it, say goodbye to App Store approval.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to try it out all the same so I hacked around to set &lt;code&gt;useSystemAppearance&lt;/code&gt; to true, set my CSS to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lo and behold, it works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whoever it was at Apple that decided to make this a CSS property is a genius because it makes it incredibly easy to provide different rules based on Liquid Glass support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
  background: rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.7);
}

@supports (-apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material) {
  background: transparent;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who cares?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an interesting piece of trivia but no-one outside of Apple can use it. So what does it matter? It doesn't. Except for the implication for what I'll call &lt;del&gt;Alastair's Grand&lt;/del&gt; The Toupée Theory of In-App Webviews (thanks to graypegg on Hacker News for the rename). Industry wide they don't have a great reputation. But my suggestion is this: the main reason webviews in apps have such a bad reputation is because you don't notice the webviews that are integrated seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It stands to reason that Apple wouldn't have developed this feature if they weren't using it. Where? We have no idea. But they must be using it somewhere. The fact that none of us have noticed exactly where suggests that we're interacting with webviews in our daily use of iOS without ever even realising it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Food for thought!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, I’m Eric, CTO at Trigger.dev (&lt;/p&gt;https://trigger.dev&lt;p&gt;). We’re a developer platform for building and running AI agents and workflows, open-source under the Apache 2.0 license (&lt;/p&gt;https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev&lt;p&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide everything needed to create production-grade agents in your codebase and deploy, run, monitor, and debug them. You can use just our primitives or combine with tools like Mastra, LangChain and Vercel AI SDK. You can self-host or use our cloud, where we take care of scaling for you. Here’s a quick demo: (https://youtu.be/kFCzKE89LD8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started in 2023 as a way to reliably run async background jobs/workflows in TypeScript (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686). Initially we didn’t deploy your code, we just orchestrated it. But we found that most developers struggled to write reliable code with implicit determinism, found breaking their work into small “steps” tricky, and they wanted to install any system packages they needed. Serverless timeouts made this even more painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to allow you to wait for things to happen: on external events, other tasks finishing, or just time passing. Those waits can take minutes, hours, or forever in the case of events, so you can’t just keep a server running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution was to build and operate our own serverless cloud infrastructure. The key breakthrough that enabled this was realizing we could snapshot the CPU and memory state. This allowed us to pause running code, store the snapshot, then restore it later on a different physical server. We currently use Checkpoint Restore In Userspace (CRIU) which Google has been using at scale inside Borg since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, our adoption has really taken off especially because of AI agents/workflows. This has opened up a ton of new use cases like compute-heavy tasks such as generating videos using AI (Icon.com), real-time computer use (Scrapybara), AI enrichment pipelines (Pallet, Centralize), and vibe coding tools (Hero UI, Magic Patterns, Capy.ai).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get started with Trigger.dev cloud (https://cloud.trigger.dev), self-hosting (https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/overview), or read the docs (https://trigger.dev/docs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sneak peek at some upcoming changes: 1) warm starts for self-hosting 2) switching to MicroVMs for execution – this will be open source, self-hostable, and will include checkpoint/restoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to be sharing this with HN and are open to all feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are all moved by great movies, cinematography, and stories. Watching them is fun because you can imagine yourself resonating with a character. You are thrilled by the tension the story creates and curious how it will be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many find software development a dull job where you have to write exactly what your PM or client asks for. It’s exciting at first, but it can become boring after a few iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Whatever doesn’t excite you, change it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we, as developers, push ourselves to be protagonists, we discover many problems to solve — a lot of tension to resolve. Here are a few good problems for everyday devs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your CI/CD takes a huge amount of time because you forgot to leverage caching.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You forgot to add connection pooling and your service bombarded the database, causing too many open connections.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You misconfigured the garbage collector and now you have a memory leak that keeps growing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it takes you more than 3 seconds to understand what you wrote last week, it’s poorly written.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Latency is high for your users in Mumbai because your servers are in Singapore.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The database becomes very slow when you start dumping data in batches.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You want consistent API responses for read operations for users in both Mumbai and Singapore.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are not trivial problems; they happen every day. These are our villains — irritating, unwanted, and surprising. We should eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pick your fight. This is one way to make your day exciting. If you can’t tackle these at work, do it in your personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you chase the right tension, a story will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A string formatting library in 65 lines of C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this write-up, I will walk you through an implementation of a string formatting library for C++ I came up with for my video game. The end result came out really compact, at only 65 lines of codeâproviding a skeleton that can be supplemented with additional functionality at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given a format bufferâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char buffer[64];
String_Buffer buf = {str, sizeof str};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦the &lt;code&gt;fmt::format&lt;/code&gt; function provided by this library can be called with a format string parameter, containing the character sequence &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; (a hole) where parameters are to be substituted, as well as the parameters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "Hello, {}!", "world");
assert(strcmp(str, "Hello, world!") == 0);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a literal &lt;code&gt;{{&lt;/code&gt; is needed, the &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; must be doubledâeven when format arguments are not present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "Hello, {{}!");
assert(strcmp(str, "Hello, {}!") == 0);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, when a format argument is not present, no undefined behaviour occursâthe hole is rendered as the empty string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "empty {} hole");
assert(strcmp(str, "empty  hole") == 0);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple format arguments can be specified as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "[{}] [{}] {}", "main", "info", "Hewwo :3");
assert(strcmp(str, "[main] [info] Hewwo :3") == 0);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case the buffer is not sufficiently large to contain the full string, the function writes as many characters as it can, and sets the &lt;code&gt;String_Buffer&lt;/code&gt;âs &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; variable to the amount of characters required.
That way, it is possible for the caller to tell if the buffer has been exhausted, and reallocate it to an appropriate size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(
	buf,
	"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
	"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa{} {}",
	"Vector", "Amber"
);
assert(strcmp(
	str,
	"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
	"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaV"
) == 0);
assert(buf.len == 74);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional functions can be written on top of this base functionality to improve ergonomics in real-world code. These are included in Ergonomic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Problem statement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A string formatting library consists of a single function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;. You give the function a format string, which describes the output shape, as well as a set of format parameters, which the function then substitutes into the format string, rendering them in a human-readable way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;function ought to write to a pre-allocated buffer of characters.&lt;p&gt;This is a choice made in favour of simplicity: writing to a pre-allocated buffer can fail, but compared to arbitrary I/O, there is only one failure mode: the buffer is exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this cannot work in memory-constrained environments, such as embedded devicesâwhere you would want to write to a small buffer and flush it in a loop to reduce memory usageâbut this does not apply in the context of a desktop video game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As already mentioned in the usage overview, if the buffer is full, the function should return the number of characters that would have been written, had the buffer capacity not been exceededâsuch that the caller can choose to reallocate the backing buffer to an appropriate size, and try formatting again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has to be a format string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of a format string-less API is C++âs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of having a format string like&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;opts to use overloads of&lt;code&gt;operator&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;to write to the output. This has the disadvantage of not being greppable (which is useful for debugging error logs), as well as not being localisable (because there is no format string that could be replaced at runtime).&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I donât want the format string to have extra specifiers such as Câs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;%x&lt;/code&gt;, etc. specifying the type of output, or Pythonâs&lt;code&gt;{:.3}&lt;/code&gt;, for specifying the style of output. The C approach is error-prone and inextensible, and the Python approach, while convenient, increases parser complexity and reduces greppability. Instead, the representation is defined only according to the formatted valueâs type.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has to have a small footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There exist plenty of string formatting libraries for C++, such as {fmt}, or even the recently introduced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::print&lt;/code&gt;, but they suffer from gigantic compile-time complexity through their heavy use of template metaprogramming.&lt;p&gt;While my compilation time benchmark results for {fmt} werenât as dire as those presented in their README, they still donât paint a pretty pictureâwith a simple program using&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;taking ~35 ms to compile, and the equivalent program using {fmt} taking ~200 ms.&lt;p&gt;I also find the benefits of an open rather than closed API, as well as compile-time checked format strings, dubious. Instead, I want something lean and small, using basic features of the language, and easy enough to drop into your own project, then extend and modify according to your needsâin spirit of rxiâs simple serialisation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply using&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;is not good enough.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation walkthrough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will start by defining the &lt;code&gt;String_Buffer&lt;/code&gt; type, which also serves as the formatterâs state.
It represents a user-provided string buffer with a capacity and a length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct String_Buffer
{
	char* str;
	int cap;
	int len = 0;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;String_Buffer&lt;/code&gt; is intended to be initialised via aggregate initialisation (&lt;code&gt;{str, cap}&lt;/code&gt;.)
This mimics the &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; API, which accepts its buffer and size arguments in the same order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the core of the libraryâs output is &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;.
It performs a bounds-checked write of a string with known length to the output string buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void write(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* str, int len)
{
	int remaining_cap = buf.cap - buf.len - 1; // leave one byte for NUL
	int write_len = len &amp;gt; remaining_cap ? remaining_cap : len;
	if (write_len &amp;gt; 0)
		memcpy(buf.str + buf.len, str, write_len);
	buf.len += len;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My implementation truncates the output if the buffer size is exhausted, but keeps incrementing the bufferâs &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; past &lt;code&gt;cap&lt;/code&gt;, such that the caller can know the full number of characters written after all &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;s, and adjust accordingly.
This is a deliberate choice coming from the fact that &lt;code&gt;String_Buffer&lt;/code&gt; does not own the bufferâs allocation, and the fact that string formatting is a performance-sensitive piece of code, which will be called often in the game loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it is trivial to replace the length saturation logic with a call to &lt;code&gt;realloc&lt;/code&gt;, should that be the more appropriate choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having this base &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; function, we can implement a set of overloaded functions that will write out values of various types to the string buffer.
These functions will be used by our &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; function, to write out format arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The set of functions implemented here directly corresponds to the types of arguments youâll be able to pass into &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* value)
{
    write(buf, value, strlen(value));
}

void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, bool value) { /* ... */ }
void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, char value) { /* ... */ }
void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, int value) { /* ... */ }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;write_value&lt;/code&gt; for various types for a set of example implementations for other types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now onto parsing format strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format strings can be defined as a sequence of literals interspersed with arguments. That is, a format string always takes the form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fstr = { literal, hole }, literal;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leading and trailing &lt;code&gt;literal&lt;/code&gt; can be the empty string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task of processing the literal parts is done by a function called &lt;code&gt;next_hole&lt;/code&gt;.
It parses the format string, looking for a character sequence representing a hole &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, and writes the string preceding the hole &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; to the output buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool next_hole(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char*&amp;amp; fstr)
{
	const char* prefix = fstr;
	while (*fstr != 0) {
		if (*fstr == '{') {
			int len = fstr - prefix;
			++fstr;
			if (*fstr == '}') {
				++fstr;
				write(buf, prefix, len);
				return true;
			}
			if (*fstr == '{') {
				write(buf, prefix, len);
				prefix = fstr;
				++fstr;
			}
		}
		++fstr;
	}
	write(buf, prefix, fstr - prefix);
	return false;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fstr&lt;/code&gt; is received as a reference to a pointer, representing the format stringâs parsing state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A call to &lt;code&gt;next_hole&lt;/code&gt; will write out the literal part, visualised with &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;, and leave the &lt;code&gt;fstr&lt;/code&gt; pointer past the hole &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, visualised with &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Hello, {}!
-------  ^
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, it will return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to signal that it stopped at a hole.&lt;lb/&gt; In case there is no hole however, and the end of the string is reached, it will return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Hello, {}!
         -^ end of string
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we handle the &lt;code&gt;{{&lt;/code&gt; escaping case.
when &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; is encountered directly after another &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;, we have to flush the current literal, and start a new one directly after the first &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;. Underlined with &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; are the spans of characters that get written to the output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;empty {{} hole
------- ------
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we define &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;: the function that accepts a format string, a set of arguments, and inserts them into the output string.
It makes use of an additional function &lt;code&gt;format_value&lt;/code&gt;, which tries to find the next hole, and if found, writes out a format argument in its place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
void format_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* fstr, const T&amp;amp; value)
{
	if (next_hole(buf, fstr))
		write_value(buf, value);
}

template&amp;lt;typename... Args&amp;gt;
void format(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* fstr, const Args&amp;amp;... args)
{
	(format_value(buf, fstr, args), ...);
	while (next_hole(buf, fstr)) {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with C++ template metaprogramming, &lt;code&gt;(format_value(buf, fstr, args), ...)&lt;/code&gt; is a fold expression.
Given any number of &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, it will expand into a sequence of calls to &lt;code&gt;format_value&lt;/code&gt;, one for each element in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, separated by the &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; operator. For example, if two arguments: a &lt;code&gt;const char*&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, are passed into &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;&amp;gt;
void format&amp;lt;const char*, int&amp;gt;(
	String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf,
	const char* fstr,
	const char* a1, int a2)
{
	(format_value(buf, fstr, a1), format_value(buf, fstr, a2));
	while (next_hole(buf, fstr)) {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the overloads of &lt;code&gt;write_value&lt;/code&gt; must be declared before &lt;code&gt;format_value&lt;/code&gt;.
This is because the &lt;code&gt;write_value&lt;/code&gt; name is not dependent on any template arguments, and is therefore early-bound at &lt;code&gt;format_value&lt;/code&gt;âs definition site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This choice was made for the sake of simplicity, but if it turns out to be a problem, it is possible to use specialisation. It is important to note though that specialisation bypasses overload resolution, so this will not work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, T value) = delete;

template&amp;lt;&amp;gt;
void write_value&amp;lt;const char*&amp;gt;(
	String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* value)
{
	if (next_hole(buf, fstr))
		write(buf, value, strlen(value));
}

template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
void format_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char*&amp;amp; fstr, const T&amp;amp; value)
{
	if (next_hole(buf, fstr))
		write_value&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(buf, value);
}

template&amp;lt;typename... Args&amp;gt;
void format(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* fstr, const Args&amp;amp;... args)
{
	(format_value(buf, fstr, args), ...);
	while (next_hole(buf, fstr)) {}
}

format(buf, "Hello, {}!", "world");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;because the type of &lt;code&gt;"world"&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;char [5]&lt;/code&gt;, and not &lt;code&gt;const char*&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;write_value&amp;lt;char [5]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is deleted.
This should be solvable with some additional work, but Iâve deemed it unnecessary in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a single .cpp file, together with wrapping all the functionality in a namespace, this implementation, together with the implementation of &lt;code&gt;write_value&lt;/code&gt; for strings, equates to a mere 65 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a real project, you will probably want to move some of the private implementation details to a separate .cpp file. Hereâs the full source code listing, split into a header file, and an implementation file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#pragma once

struct String_Buffer
{
	char* str;
	int cap;
	int len = 0;
};

namespace fmt {

void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* value);
// (additional overloads here)

// implementation detail
bool next_hole(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char*&amp;amp; fstr);

template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
void format_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char*&amp;amp; fstr, const T&amp;amp; value)

	while (next_hole(buf, fstr)) {}
}

}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "format.hpp"

#include &amp;lt;cstring&amp;gt;

	int write_len = len &amp;gt; remaining_cap ? remaining_cap : len;
	if (write_len &amp;gt; 0)
		memcpy(buf.str + buf.len, str, write_len);
	buf.len += len;
}

}

			int len = fstr - prefix;
			++fstr;

				++fstr;
				write(buf, prefix, len);
				return true;
			}
			if (*fstr == '{') {
				write(buf, prefix, len);
				prefix = fstr;
				++fstr;

	write(buf, prefix, fstr - prefix);
	return false;
}

}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design remarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Escaping ambiguity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The choice of &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; as the hole syntax is not accidental.
I evaluated whether holes could be represented with a single character &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "Hello, %!", "world");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it turned that using only a single character introduces an ambiguity around escaping. What should this format to: &lt;code&gt;hello%&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;%hello&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "%%%", "hello");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be possible to use a different, unambiguous combination for escaping, such as &lt;code&gt;%_&lt;/code&gt;, but it looks very alien, and you have to use it any time you want a &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; sign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "%%_ complete", 33);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare this to the current approach, where you only have to double the &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; when itâs directly preceding &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fmt::format(buf, "{}% complete", 33);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also more closely mimics the final output string. Reading the previous &lt;code&gt;%%_&lt;/code&gt; example requires knowing that &lt;code&gt;%_&lt;/code&gt; is a special sequence that turns into &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, whereas reading this example doesnât require any extra knowledge (and progress reporting with percentages is a somewhat common use case for format strings).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Iteration through parameter packs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another idea I had was to do an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-style API, though done with a function call rather than an operator chain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;format(buf, "Hello, ", "world!");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The observation about poor greppability didnât occur to me until later, but it seemed simple enough to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void format_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* value);
void format_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, int value);

template&amp;lt;typename... Args&amp;gt;
void format(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const Args&amp;amp;... args)
{
	(format_value(buf, args), ...);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I went with this approach, it would be even less code, but the poor greppability and non-localisability of format strings kept bugging me, so I stared wondering if thereâs some way to add that format string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seemed impossible, because the format string can be provided at runtime. This would mean &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; would have to iterate through the format string to parse out the holes &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, and when a hole is hit, insert the Nth parameter, starting with 0 for the first hole, N for the last hole.
But it seemed to require indexing the parameter pack, and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;there is no way to index a parameter pack in C++20,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; there is no way to index it using a runtime value in C++26, which adds parameter pack indexing &lt;code&gt;pack...[x]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few hours later, I realised it is possible to have the parameter pack expansion drive the parsing, rather than driving the parsing from &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; and trying to index the parameter pack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is single-handedly the most elegant bit of this library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; It generates optimal, extremely minimal code: a sequence of calls to the appropriate overloads of &lt;code&gt;format_value&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It handles out-of-bounds gracefully: because there is no indexing of parameters, and therefore no out-of-bounds.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder what other cool things could be done with this technique.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Failed idea: using dynamic typing for format arguments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My initial idea for a minimal C++ formatting library involved a &lt;code&gt;Format_Argument&lt;/code&gt; type, passed in an &lt;code&gt;std::initializer_list&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; function.
The API was shaped like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;enum class Format_Argument_Type
{
	boolean,
	int32,
	float32,
	vec4,
};

struct Format_Argument
{
	Format_Argument_Type type;
	union
	{
		bool b;
		int32_t i;
		float f;
		Vec4 v;
	};
};

void format_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const Format_Argument&amp;amp; arg);
void format(
	String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf,
	const char* fstr,
	std::initializer_list&amp;lt;Format_Argument&amp;gt; args);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach has a couple problems though, which were enough of a deal breaker for me that I dropped the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Format_Argument&lt;/code&gt;is as large as the biggest value able to be formatted. In this case, assuming&lt;code&gt;Vec4&lt;/code&gt;is four 32-bit floats, it is 20 bytes. This space has to be allocated on the stack for the&lt;code&gt;initializer_list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely compilers would be able to optimise all that away, especially if the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;function lived in a separate object file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The example above is actually incomplete. What&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Format_Argument&lt;/code&gt;has to look like is actually this:&lt;code&gt;struct Format_Argument { Format_Argument_Type type; union { bool b; int32_t i; float f; Vec4 v; }; Format_Argument(bool b) : type(Format_Argument_Type::boolean), b(b) {} Format_Argument(int32_t i) : type(Format_Argument_Type::int32), i(i) {} Format_Argument(float f) : type(Format_Argument_Type::float32), f(f) {} Format_Argument(Vec4 v) : type(Format_Argument_Type::vec4), v(v) {} };&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then you have to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;on the format argumentâs&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;format_value&lt;/code&gt;, introducing further duplication.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why not &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room. Why do this when you have &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer to this is: verbosity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is no way to extend &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; with your own types in standard C.
I often want to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; 3D vectors for debugging, and I have to resort to listing out all the axes manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;printf(
	"%f %f %f",
	player.position.x,
	player.position.y,
	player.position.z
);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think you can see how this gets old real quick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combine this with the inability to use &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; as an expression, which is particularly painful with ImGuiâwhere I often want to format a window title, or button label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char entity_name[64];
snprintf(
	entity_name, sizeof entity_name,
	"%d(%d) %s",
	entity_id.index, entity_id.generation,
	entity_kind::names[entity.kind]
);
if (ImGui::TreeNode(entity_name)) {
	// ...
	ImGui::TreePop();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible to write a function which allocates the temporary buffer and writes to it in one go, akin to my &lt;code&gt;fmt::print&lt;/code&gt; function, but even doing that is verbose, as you have to deal with &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt;âtherefore needing two sets of functions, one for variadic arguments &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; and one for &lt;code&gt;va_list&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; is also error-prone.
It is easy to mess up and use the wrong specifier type, or pass too few arguments to the function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;printf("%x", 1.0f); // oops
printf("%x");       // ...not again
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes it unusable for localisation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also no easy, idiomatic way to concatenate strings written with &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char str[4] = {0};
int cursor = 0;
cursor += snprintf(str, sizeof str, "hello ");
cursor += snprintf(str, sizeof str, "world!");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This naive way is not actually correct, because &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of characters that would be written into &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, had the buffer been large enough.
Therefore, the second call to &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt; in the above example ends up writing past the bufferâs bounds (at index 6.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extras&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the base library is very bare-bones, Iâm including some additional snippets to help you get it integrated into your project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;write_value&lt;/code&gt; for various types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, const char* value)
{
	write(buf, value, int(strlen(value)));
}

void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, bool value)
{
	if (value)
		write(buf, "true", 4);
	else
		write(buf, "false", 5);
}

void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, char value)
{
	write(buf, &amp;amp;value, 1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For integers, hereâs an implementation of &lt;code&gt;write_value&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;int64_t&lt;/code&gt;.
This can confuse C++âs overload resolution, so Iâd recommend adding additional overloads for smaller integers &lt;code&gt;int8_t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int16_t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;int32_t&lt;/code&gt;, also &lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ptrdiff_t&lt;/code&gt;, calling into the &lt;code&gt;int64_t&lt;/code&gt; overload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, int64_t value)
{
	if (value == 0) {
		write(buf, "0", 1);
		return;
	}
	if (value &amp;lt; 0) {
		write(buf, "-", 1);
		value = -value;
	}

	char digits[20] = {};
	int i = sizeof digits - 1;
	while (value &amp;gt; 0) {
		digits[i--] = '0' + (value % 10);
		value /= 10;
	}
	int ndigits = sizeof digits - i - 1;
	write(buf, digits + i + 1, ndigits);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;uint64_t&lt;/code&gt; version can be created in a similar manner, by removing the &lt;code&gt;if (value &amp;lt; 0)&lt;/code&gt; case near the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This algorithm works for any radix (base 2, base 8, base 16, â¦). In my own implementation, I have a &lt;code&gt;Format_Hex&lt;/code&gt; newtype, which changes the output to base 16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct Format_Hex
{
	uint64_t value;
};

namespace fmt
{

inline Format_Hex hex(uint64_t value) { return {value}; }

}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For floats, I defer the work onto &lt;code&gt;snprintf&lt;/code&gt;âs &lt;code&gt;%g&lt;/code&gt; specifier, because I trust it to do a better job than I ever could, even if a bit slow.
You can also use Ryu for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, double value)
{
	char f[32] = {};
	int len = snprintf(f, sizeof f, "%g", value);
	if (len &amp;gt; sizeof f - 1)
		len = sizeof f - 1;
	write(buf, f, len);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, donât forget about vectorsâwhich were one of my motivating examples for abandoning &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void write_value(String_Buffer&amp;amp; buf, Vec3 value)
{
	write(buf, "(", 1);
	write_value(buf, value.x);
	write(buf, ", ", 2);
	write_value(buf, value.y);
	write(buf, ", ", 2);
	write_value(buf, value.z);
	write(buf, ")", 1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ergonomic functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ergonomics of having to allocate a backing buffer, and then a &lt;code&gt;String_Buffer&lt;/code&gt; afterwards, can get a bit cumbersome.
To help alleviate this, I have a &lt;code&gt;Static_String&lt;/code&gt; type, together with a &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function, which formats to a &lt;code&gt;Static_String&lt;/code&gt; and returns it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;int N&amp;gt;
struct Static_String
{
	char data[N] = {};

	const char* operator*() const { return data; }
};

namespace fmt
{

template&amp;lt;int N, typename... Args&amp;gt;
Static_String&amp;lt;N&amp;gt; print(const char* fstr, const Args&amp;amp;... args)
{
	Static_String&amp;lt;N&amp;gt; str;
	String_Buffer buf = {str.data, sizeof str.data};
	format(buf, fstr, args...);
	return str;
}

}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes it very easy to use a format string wherever an ordinary &lt;code&gt;const char*&lt;/code&gt; is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (ImGui::TreeNode(
	*fmt::print&amp;lt;64&amp;gt;("{}({}) {}", index, generation, entity_kind)
)) {
	// ...
	ImGui::TreePop();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you to my friend Tori for giving a whole bunch of solid feedback on a draft of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3.0 Published on 15 Sep 2025 by Marcin Kulik&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m happy to announce the release of asciinema CLI 3.0!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a complete rewrite of asciinema in Rust, upgrading the recording file format, introducing terminal live streaming, and bringing numerous improvements across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll go over the highlights of the release. For a deeper overview of new features and improvements, see the release notes and the detailed changelog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s get the Rust rewrite topic out of the way. I did it because I felt like it. But seriously, I felt like it because I prefer working with Rust 100x more than with Python these days. And this type of code, with syscalls and concurrency, is way easier to deal with in Rust than in Python. That’s my experience, YMMV. Anyway, in addition to making me enjoy working with this component of asciinema again, the rewrite resulted in faster startup, easier installation (a static binary), and made many new features possible by integrating asciinema virtual terminal (also Rust) into the CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at what’s cool and new now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;asciicast v3 file format&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new asciicast v3 file format is an evolution of the good old asciicast v2. It addresses several shortcomings of the previous format that were discovered over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The major change in the new format is the use of intervals (deltas) for timing session events. v2 used absolute timestamps (measured since session start), which had its own pros and cons. One often-brought-up issue was the difficulty of editing the recordings - timestamps of all following events had to be adjusted when adding/removing/updating events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than timing, the header has been restructured, grouping related things together, e.g. all terminal-related metadata is now under &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt;. There’s also
support for the new &lt;code&gt;"x"&lt;/code&gt; (exit) event type, for storing the session exit
status. Finally, line comments are allowed by using the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; character as the
first character on a line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a short recording in asciicast v3 format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{"version": 3, "term": {"cols": 80, "rows": 24, "type": "xterm-256color"}, "timestamp": 1504467315, "title": "Demo", "env": {"SHELL": "/bin/zsh"}}
# event stream follows the header
[0.248848, "o", "Hey Dougal...\n"]
[0.248848, "o", "Yes Ted?\n"]
[1.001376, "o", "Is there anything on your mind?\n"]
[3.500000, "m", ""]
[0.143733, "o", "No."]
# terminal window resized to 90 cols and 30 rows
[2.050000, "r", "90x30"]
[1.541828, "o", "Bye!"]
[0.8870, "x", "0"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new format is already supported by asciinema server and asciinema player.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Live terminal streaming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new CLI allows for live streaming of terminal sessions, and provides two modes for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local mode uses built-in HTTP server, allowing people to view the stream on trusted networks (e.g. a LAN). In this mode no data is sent anywhere, except to the viewers’ browsers, which may require opening a firewall port. The CLI bundles the latest version of asciinema player, and uses it to connect to the stream from the page served by the built-in server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ asciinema stream --local
::: asciinema session started
::: Live streaming at http://127.0.0.1:37881
::: Press &amp;lt;ctrl+d&amp;gt; or type 'exit' to end
$ _
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote mode publishes the stream through an asciinema server (either asciinema.org or a self-hosted one), which acts as a relay, delivering the stream to the viewers at a shareable URL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ asciinema stream --remote
::: asciinema session started
::: Live streaming at https://asciinema.org/s/TQGS82DwiBS1bYAY
::: Press &amp;lt;ctrl+d&amp;gt; or type 'exit' to end
$ _
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two modes can be used together as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a live stream of &lt;code&gt;btop&lt;/code&gt; running on one of the asciinema.org servers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also watch it directly on asciinema.org at asciinema.org/s/olesiD03BIFH6Yz1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read more about the streaming architecture and supported protocols here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;asciinema player (seen above) supports all the described protocols. To make the viewing experience smooth and glitch-free, it implements an adaptive buffering mechanism. It measures network latency in real-time and adjusts the buffer size constantly, aiming for a good balance between low latency and buffer-underrun protection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;asciinema server can now record every live stream and turn it into a regular recording. At the moment, asciinema server running at asciinema.org has stream recording disabled and a concurrent live stream limit of 1, but you can self-host the server where recording is enabled and there’s no concurrent stream limit by default. The limits on asciinema.org may change. I’d like to first see how the streaming feature affects resource usage (btw, shout-out to Brightbox, which provides cloud services for asciinema.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Local-first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early versions of asciinema, &lt;code&gt;asciinema rec&lt;/code&gt; didn’t support saving to a
file - the recording was saved to a tmp file, uploaded to asciinema.org, and
the tmp file was removed. Later on, the CLI got the ability to specify a
filename, which allowed you to save the result of a recording session to a file
in asciicast v1 format and decide whether you want to keep it local only or
publish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although optional, the filename argument had long been available. However, many, many tutorials on the internet (probably including asciinema’s own docs) showed examples of recording and publishing in one go with &lt;code&gt;asciinema rec&lt;/code&gt;.
That was fine - many people loved this short path from recording to sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, I started seeing two problems with this. The first one is that lots of people still think you must upload to asciinema.org, which is not true. You can save locally and nothing leaves your machine. The second one is that the optionality of the filename made it possible to unintentionally publish a recording, and potentially leak sensitive data. And it’s a completely valid concern!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of that, on several occasions I’ve seen negative comments saying “asciinema is shady” /m\. It was never shady. It’s just a historical thing. I just kept the original behavior for backward compatibility. asciinema.org is not a commercial product - it’s an instance of asciinema server, which is meant to give users an easy way to share, and to give a taste of what you get when you self-host the server. In fact, I encourage everyone to self-host it, as the recordings uploaded to asciinema.org are a liability for me (while being a good promotion of the project :)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this clears up any confusion and suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, many things have changed since the original behavior of &lt;code&gt;asciinema rec&lt;/code&gt; was implemented, including my approach to sharing my data with cloud
services. These days I self-host lots of services on a server at home, and I
try to avoid cloud services if I can (I’m pragmatic about it though).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The streaming feature was built from the ground up to support the local mode, which came first, and the remote mode followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In asciinema CLI 2.4, released 2 years ago, I made the &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt; command show a
prompt where you have to explicitly make a decision on what to do with the
recording. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ asciinema rec
asciinema: recording asciicast to /tmp/tmpo8_612f8-ascii.cast
asciinema: press &amp;lt;ctrl-d&amp;gt; or type "exit" when you're done
$ echo hello
hello
$ exit 
asciinema: recording finished
(s)ave locally, (u)pload to asciinema.org, (d)iscard
[s,u,d]? _
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a stopgap and a way to prepare users for further changes that are coming now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 3.0, the filename is always required, and the &lt;code&gt;rec&lt;/code&gt; command no longer has
upload capability. To publish a recording to asciinema.org or a self-hosted
asciinema server, use the explicit &lt;code&gt;asciinema upload &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More self-hosting-friendly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A related improvement introduced in this release is the new server URL prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using a command that integrates with asciinema server (&lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;auth&lt;/code&gt;) for the first time, a prompt is shown, pre-filled with
https://asciinema.org (for convenience). This lets you choose an asciinema
server instance explicitly and intentionally. The choice is saved for future
invocations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was always possible to point the CLI to another asciinema server with a config file or environment variable, but this new prompt should come in handy especially when running the CLI in a non-workstation/non-laptop yet interactive environment, such as a fresh VM or a dev container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This change should make it easier to use the CLI with your own asciinema server, and at the same time it doubles as an additional guard preventing unintended data leaks (to asciinema.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m really excited about this release. It’s been in the making for a while, but it’s out now, and I’m looking forward to seeing what new use-cases and workflows people will discover with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s going to take a moment until 3.0 shows up in package repositories for all supported platforms/distros. Meanwhile, you can download prebuilt binaries for GNU/Linux and macOS from the GitHub release, or build it from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading to this point!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently bought a cheap Tapo indoor camera to see what my dog gets up to when I am out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What actually followed? I ended up reverse-engineering onboarding flows, decompiling an APK, MITMing TLS sessions, and writing cryptographic scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main motivation for this project really stemmed from the fact that the camera annoyed me from day one. Setting the camera up in frigate was quite painful, no one really seemed to know how these cameras worked online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIDENOTE: If you want 2 way audio to work in frigate you must use the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tapo://&lt;/code&gt;go2rtc configuration for your main stream instead of the usual&lt;code&gt;rtsp://&lt;/code&gt;. TP-Link are lazy and only implement 2 way audio on their own proprietary API.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One undocumented behavior that tripped me up was that the device’s API is supposed to accept credentials &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your-tapo-cloud-password&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; after onboarding. However after banging my head against a wall for a few hours I later discovered that if you change your cloud password after onboarding, paired devices don’t get the memo ð.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This implied a few things to me that started the cogs turning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There must be a call made during on-boarding that syncs the device password with the cloud password&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The device must either allow unauthenticated calls before this step or have some sort of default password.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So considering my onboarding woes and the fact that I was starting to recoil every time the tapo app tried to jam a “Tapo Care” subscription down my throat, a cloudless onboarding solution for the device was beginning to look more and more desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step to cracking this egg was to be be able to snoop on what the app and the camera are saying to each other during onboarding. E.g, establish a man in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Man in the middle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To man in the middle a phone app, you must be able to route all http(s) traffic via a proxy server you control. Historically this has been quite simple to achieve, simply spin up a proxy on a computer, add the proxy’s self-signed certificate to the phone’s truststore, and configure the phone to point at the proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, modern phone apps can use a few nasty tricks to render this approach ineffective. Namely they will blatantly ignore proxies, throw the system truststore to the wind and make liberal use of certificate pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most full-proof technique for generically MITMing an app has therefore become dynamic instrumentation via tools like &lt;code&gt;frida&lt;/code&gt;. What this allows us to do is force an app to use the proxies and certificates that we tell it to whilst batting aside it’s attempts to do things like certificate pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the setup ended up looking like this (full setup guide here ):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;--- config: theme: 'base' themeVariables: primaryColor: '#00000000' primaryTextColor: '#fff' primaryBorderColor: '#ffffff8e' lineColor: '#fff' secondaryColor: '#fff' tertiaryColor: '#fff' --- sequenceDiagram participant A as Tapo App &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(with frida hooks) participant L as Laptop &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;(mitmproxy) participant C as Tapo Camera A-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;L: Request L-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;L: Record request L-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;C: Forward request C--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;L: Response L-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;L: Record response L--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;A: Forward response&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After spinning up &lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt;, injecting the frida scripts
, and onboarding the camera, we finally see an initial login flow â before the admin password ever gets changed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, subsequent requests look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "method": "securePassthrough",
  "params": {
    "request": "bAhdgihJ9j6PrrknnbXWATBohGTZK5llv3MEzRcmoAmcxexmlVNz3OUX2r0h9a9EG/3X0tBpPi654T2+BjqVEOn2D178kokBpf8RQj01AvBZLYD5S5sFeaCXWiRXA7MgQUppROV4AbrU4f+GOM37KgPqT59qgLVja2slw6CzrKjPzOrG4Ho6Mu6wBa1xepcj"
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And responses look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "seq": 584,
  "result": {
    "response": "Gqz1wbXAig/3wL+kXzY2Ig3hq+JSYasYI7FXdMNZR5PyH8bpLX+GJqQbImUtby9IEj5HQDhxqcTa+dUqQjI0GaGCxuGHqmrgQ0FeyCTQjBiW5gslAPQG33wj44OOkAep"
  },
  "error_code": 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So from this initial dive we have learned that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tapo 100% has a default password due to the fact that it performs a full login before it knows anything about the cloud password.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tapo has an encrypted &lt;code&gt;securePassthrough&lt;/code&gt;channel for its API calls to prevent peeping toms such as myself from spilling the beans.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The JADX dive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next logical step is to decompile the apk in JADX and start rummaging around for a default password.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial login call that we captured references an &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; username:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "method": "login",
  "params": {
    "cnonce": "AD0E189F6E1BA335",
    "encrypt_type": "3",
    "username": "admin"
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching for &lt;code&gt;"admin"&lt;/code&gt; in JADX gives us many hits but there are a few concentrated in a &lt;code&gt;CameraOnboardingViewModel&lt;/code&gt; class that look interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;m98131y2&lt;/code&gt; appears to be returning a password that is then passed to the &lt;code&gt;new Account()&lt;/code&gt; call. Following this function up the chain, we hit gold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already know that the device is using &lt;code&gt;encrypt_type: 3&lt;/code&gt;, so that means our default password is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;TPL075526460603&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Teaching mitmproxy new tricks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the default password now revealed, we have the cards in our hand to derive session keys and decode the &lt;code&gt;securePassthrough&lt;/code&gt; messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing that would help us further is if we had a reference implementation for the authentication flow. This is where PyTapo really came in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using PyTapo as a reference, we could dump the session state and encrypted messages from mitmproxy and write a script to do some static analysis on the decrypted requests and responses, but a really cool feature of &lt;code&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/code&gt; is that it supports scripting itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this means is that we can pass a python script to mitmproxy, and have it directly decrypt request and response payloads inline whilst running a capture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I wrote &lt;code&gt;tapo_decrypt_pretty.py&lt;/code&gt; which:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Watches for the login handshake (&lt;code&gt;cnonce&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;nonce&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;device_confirm&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Derives &lt;code&gt;lsk&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ivb&lt;/code&gt;session keys from it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transparently decrypts subsequent API calls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pretty-prints them inline in mitmproxyâs UI in &lt;code&gt;request_decrypted&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;response_decrypted&lt;/code&gt;fields&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dumps them to JSON files for later analysis&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Analysing the results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complete list of calls made by the Tapo app during onboarding were:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;getAppComponentList
setLanguage
scanApList
bindToCloud
changeAdminPassword
setTimezone
setRecordPlan
setDeviceLocation
connectAp
getConnectStatus
setAccountEnabled
changeThirdAccount
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This boiled down to just four important calls:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;scanApList&lt;/code&gt;â list Wi-Fi access points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;setAccountEnabled&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;changeThirdAccount&lt;/code&gt;â enable RTSP/ONVIF account&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;changeAdminPassword&lt;/code&gt;â change from default password to the cloud password&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;connectAp&lt;/code&gt;â join the selected Wi-Fi access point&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else was fluff: timezones, record plans, binding to cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the prize for all this nonsense was a scrappy little Bash script, &lt;code&gt;tapo_onboard.sh&lt;/code&gt;
, which:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logs in with the default admin password,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scans and selects a Wifi access point&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switches off the obnoxious OSD logo on the camera feed,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enables RTSP/ONVIF capabilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changes the admin password,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And finally joins the Wi-Fi.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peeling this onion left me with a few observations on Tapoâs firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some endpoints use SHA-256 for hashing, while others cling to MD5 like itâs 2003.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are two public keys used to send passwords to the device â one that is shared with the client and another super secret one that’s hardcoded in the app. The easiest way to figure out which one to use is to flip a coin.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Password syncing between the app and its managed devices is strictly vibe-based.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole thing feels like it was cobbled together by a consortium of couch-cryptographers. But then again, it was the cheapest indoor camera on amazon, so what did I expect?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with all this said I did finally manage to figure out what the dog does when I am away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She sleeps. On the sofa. Sometimes even in her bed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing upgrades to Codex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex just got faster, more reliable, and better at real-time collaboration and tackling tasks independently anywhere you develop—whether via the terminal, IDE, web, or even your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re releasing GPT‑5-Codex—a version of GPT‑5 further optimized for agentic coding in Codex. GPT‑5-Codex was trained with a focus on real-world software engineering work; it’s equally proficient at quick, interactive sessions and at independently powering through long, complex tasks. Its code review capability can catch critical bugs before they ship. GPT‑5-Codex is available everywhere you use Codex—it’s the default for cloud tasks and code review, and developers can choose to use it for local tasks via Codex CLI and the IDE extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we first launched Codex CLI(opens in a new window) in April and Codex web in May, Codex has steadily evolved into a more effective coding collaborator. Two weeks ago, we unified Codex into a single product experience connected by your ChatGPT account, enabling you to move work seamlessly between your local environment and the cloud without losing context. Codex now works where you develop—in your terminal or IDE, on the web, in GitHub, and even in the ChatGPT iOS app. Codex is included with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these updates, Codex moves closer to what we’ve been building toward all along—a teammate that understands your context, works alongside you, and reliably takes on work for your team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5-Codex is a version of GPT‑5 further optimized for agentic software engineering in Codex. It’s trained on complex, real-world engineering tasks such as building full projects from scratch, adding features and tests, debugging, performing large-scale refactors, and conducting code reviews. It’s more steerable, adheres better to AGENTS.md(opens in a new window) instructions, and produces higher-quality code—just tell it what you need without writing long instructions on style or code cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5-Codex adapts how much time it spends thinking more dynamically based on the complexity of the task. The model combines two essential skills for a coding agent: pairing with developers in interactive sessions, and persistent, independent execution on longer tasks. That means Codex will feel snappier on small, well-defined requests or while you are chatting with it, and will work for longer on complex tasks like big refactors. During testing, we've seen GPT‑5-Codex work independently for more than 7 hours at a time on large, complex tasks, iterating on its implementation, fixing test failures, and ultimately delivering a successful implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On OpenAI employee traffic, we see that for the bottom 10% of user turns sorted by model-generated tokens (including hidden reasoning and final output), GPT‑5-Codex uses 93.7% fewer tokens than GPT‑5. Conversely, for the top 10%, GPT‑5-Codex thinks more, spending twice as long reasoning, editing and testing code, and iterating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5-Codex has been trained specifically for conducting code reviews and finding critical flaws. When reviewing, it navigates your codebase, reasons through dependencies, and runs your code and tests in order to validate correctness. We evaluated code review performance on recent commits from popular open-source repositories. For each commit, experienced software engineers evaluated review comments for correctness and importance. We find that comments by GPT‑5-Codex are less likely to be incorrect or unimportant, reserving more user attention for critical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5-Codex is a reliable partner on front-end tasks. In addition to creating aesthetic desktop apps, GPT‑5-Codex also shows significant improvements in human preference evaluations when creating mobile websites. When working in the cloud, it can look at images or screenshots you provide as input, visually inspect its progress, and display screenshots of its work to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5-Codex was purpose-built for Codex CLI, the Codex IDE extension, the Codex cloud environment, and working in GitHub, and also supports versatile tool use. Unlike GPT‑5, which is a general-purpose model, we recommend using GPT‑5-Codex only for agentic coding tasks in Codex or Codex-like environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also recently made some updates to make Codex a better pair programmer, with a revamped Codex CLI and the new Codex IDE extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex CLI is open-source, and community feedback over the last few months has been invaluable in shaping its evolution. With this feedback, we’ve rebuilt Codex CLI around agentic coding workflows to harness our models into more capable and reliable partners. You can now attach and share images—screenshots, wireframes, and diagrams—right in the CLI to build shared context on design decisions and get exactly what you want. When doing more complex work, Codex now tracks progress with a to-do list, and includes tools like web search and MCP for connecting to external systems, with more accurate tool use overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The terminal UI has also been upgraded: tool calls and diffs are better formatted and easier to follow. Approval modes are simplified to three levels: read-only with explicit approvals, auto with full workspace access but requiring approvals outside the workspace, and full access with the ability to read files anywhere and run commands with network access. It also supports compacting conversation state to make longer sessions easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the Codex CLI quickstart(opens in a new window) to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex meets you where you already work, including in your IDE. The IDE extension brings the Codex agent into VS Code, Cursor, and other VS Code forks, so that you can seamlessly preview local changes and edit code with Codex. When you use Codex in your IDE, you can write shorter prompts and get faster results because Codex can use context like the files you’ve opened or the code you’ve selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex IDE extension also lets you move work smoothly between the cloud and your local environment. You can create new cloud tasks, track in‑progress work, and review completed tasks without leaving your editor. To make finishing touches, you can open cloud tasks in your IDE, and Codex maintains context. Learn more on how to get the most out of the IDE extension in the quickstart(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to Codex CLI, the new IDE extension and GitHub integration bring the Codex cloud agent closer to developer workflows so you can now delegate tasks without switching away from your editor or GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, we’ve also been continuously improving cloud infrastructure performance. By caching containers, we’ve slashed the median completion time for new tasks and follow-ups by 90%. Codex also now automatically sets up its own environment by scanning for common setup scripts and executing them, and with configurable internet access can run commands like pip install to fetch dependencies as needed at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like in the CLI and IDE extension, you can now use images to share frontend design specs or explain UI bugs. As it builds for you, Codex can spin up its own browser, look at what it built, iterate, and attach a screenshot of the result to the task and GitHub PR. For more details, check out the docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex also now includes code review capabilities trained to catch critical flaws. Unlike static analysis tools, it matches the stated intent of a PR to the actual diff, reasons over the entire codebase and dependencies, and executes code and tests to validate behavior. Only the most thorough human reviewers put this level of effort into every PR they review, so Codex fills the gap—helping teams find problems earlier, reduce reviewer load, and ship with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once turned on for a GitHub repo, Codex automatically reviews PRs as they move from draft to ready, posting its analysis on the PR. If it recommends edits, you can stay in the same thread and ask Codex to implement them. You can also explicitly ask for a review by mentioning “@codex review” in a PR, and give it extra guidance like “@codex review for security vulnerabilities” or “@codex review for outdated dependencies”. Check out the quickstart(opens in a new window) to learn how to set up code review for your repos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At OpenAI, Codex now reviews the vast majority of our PRs, catching hundreds of issues every day—often before a human review begins. It’s been key to letting the Codex team move fast with greater confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How developers are using Codex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“I needed to update a codebase owned by another team for a feature release. [...] With Codex, I offloaded the refactoring and test generation while focusing on other priorities. It produced high-quality, fully tested code that I could quickly hand back — keeping the feature on schedule without adding risk.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re building Codex with a focus on protecting code and data from exfiltration, and guarding against misuse. By default, Codex runs in a sandboxed environment with network access(opens in a new window) disabled, whether locally or in the cloud. This helps ensure Codex can’t take harmful actions on your computer, and reduces the risk of prompt injections from untrusted sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex can ask for permission before potentially dangerous actions and is trained to run commands to verify its outputs. Developers can customize security settings to match their risk tolerance. In the cloud, you can limit network access to trusted domains. In the CLI and IDE extension, developers can approve commands to run with full access or allow the agent to use web search and connect to MCP servers. This can expand capabilities of the agent while increasing the risks–learn more about how to securely operate and manage Codex here(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We always encourage developers to review the agent’s work before making changes or deploying to production. Codex provides citations, terminal logs, and test results with each task to help with this. While Codex code reviews help reduce the risk of dangerous issues being deployed to production, whether created by humans or agents, we always recommend using Codex as an additional reviewer—not a replacement for human reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consistent with our approach to GPT‑5, we have decided to treat GPT‑5-Codex as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domains, and have implemented safeguards to minimize the associated risks. Read more about our assessments and robust safety approach in the system card addendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is included with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans. Usage scales with your plan: Plus, Edu and Business seats can cover a few focused coding sessions each week, while Pro can support a full workweek across multiple projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Business plans can purchase credits to enable developers to go beyond their included limits, while Enterprise plans provide a shared credit pool so you only pay for what your developers use. Learn more about usage limits in ChatGPT here(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers using Codex CLI via API key, we plan to make GPT‑5-Codex available in the API soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is becoming the coding partner we’ve always envisioned—one that’s faster, more reliable, and deeply integrated into the tools you already use. We’re excited to see what you build with it and will keep improving Codex to make it an even better teammate for your most ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;React Won by Default – And It's Killing Frontend Innovation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React-by-default has hidden costs. Here's a case for making deliberate choices to select the right framework for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;React Won by Default – And It’s Killing Frontend Innovation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React is no longer winning by technical merit. Today it is winning by default. That default is now slowing innovation across the frontend ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When teams need a new frontend, the conversation rarely starts with “What are the constraints and which tool best fits them?” It often starts with “Let’s use React; everyone knows React.” That reflex creates a self-perpetuating cycle where network effects, rather than technical fit, decide architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frameworks with real innovations struggle for adoption. Svelte compiles away framework overhead. Solid delivers fine-grained reactivity without virtual-DOM tax. Qwik achieves instant startup via resumability. These approaches can outperform React’s model in common scenarios, but they rarely get a fair evaluation because React is chosen by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React is excellent at many things. The problem isn’t React itself, it’s the React-by-default mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Innovation Ceiling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React’s technical foundations explain some of today’s friction. The virtual DOM was a clever solution for 2013’s problems, but as Rich Harris outlined in “Virtual DOM is pure overhead”, it introduces work modern compilers can often avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hooks addressed class component pain but introduced new kinds of complexity: dependency arrays, stale closures, and misused effects. Even React’s own docs emphasize restraint: “You Might Not Need an Effect”. Server Components improve time-to-first-byte, but add architectural complexity and new failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React Compiler is a smart solution that automates patterns like &lt;code&gt;useMemo&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;useCallback&lt;/code&gt;. Its existence is also a signal: we’re optimizing around constraints baked into the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast this with alternative approaches: Svelte 5’s Runes simplify reactivity at compile time; Solid’s fine-grained reactivity updates exactly what changed; Qwik’s resumability eliminates traditional hydration. These aren’t incremental tweaks to React’s model—they’re different models with different ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Innovation without adoption doesn’t change outcomes. Adoption can’t happen when the choice is made by reflex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Technical Debt We’re All Carrying&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defaulting to React often ships a runtime and reconciliation cost we no longer question. Even when it’s fast enough, the ceiling is lower than compile-time or fine-grained models. Developer time is spent managing re-renders, effect dependencies, and hydration boundaries instead of shipping value. The broader lesson from performance research is consistent: JavaScript is expensive on the critical path (The Cost of JavaScript).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve centered mental models around “React patterns” instead of web fundamentals, reducing portability of skills and making architectural inertia more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loss isn’t just performance, it’s opportunity cost when better-fit alternatives are never evaluated. For instance, benchmarks like the JS Framework Benchmark show alternatives like Solid achieving up to 2-3x faster updates in reactivity-heavy scenarios compared to React.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Frameworks Being Suffocated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Svelte: The Compiler Revolution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Svelte shifts work to compile time: no virtual DOM, minimal runtime. Components become targeted DOM operations. The mental model aligns with web fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But “not enough jobs” keeps Svelte adoption artificially low despite its technical superiority for most use cases. Real-world examples, like The Guardian’s adoption of Svelte for their frontend, demonstrate measurable gains in performance and developer productivity, with reported reductions in bundle sizes and faster load times. For instance, as detailed in Wired’s article on Svelte, developer Shawn Wang (@swyx on X/Twitter) reduced his site’s size from 187KB in React to just 9KB in Svelte by leveraging its compile-time optimizations, which shift framework overhead away from runtime. This leads to faster, more efficient apps especially on slow connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Solid: The Reactive Primitive Approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solid delivers fine-grained reactivity with JSX familiarity. Updates flow through signals directly to affected DOM nodes, bypassing reconciliation bottlenecks. Strong performance characteristics, limited mindshare. As outlined in Solid’s comparison guide, this approach enables more efficient updates than React’s virtual DOM, with precise reactivity that minimizes unnecessary work and improves developer experience through simpler state management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While prominent case studies are scarcer than for more established frameworks, this is largely due to Solid’s lower adoption. Yet anecdotal reports from early adopters suggest similar transformative gains in update efficiency and code simplicity, waiting to be scaled and shared as more teams experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Qwik: The Resumability Innovation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwik uses resumability instead of hydration, enabling instant startup by loading only what the current interaction needs. Ideal for large sites, long sessions, or slow networks. According to Qwik’s Think Qwik guide, this is achieved through progressive loading and serializing both state and code. Apps can thus resume execution instantly without heavy client-side bootstrapping, resulting in superior scalability and reduced initial load times compared to traditional frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Success stories for Qwik may be less visible simply because fewer teams have broken from defaults to try it. But those who have report dramatic improvements in startup times and resource efficiency, indicating a wealth of untapped potential if adoption grows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three under-adopted not for lack of merit, but because the default choice blocks trying them out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, React’s API surface area is notably larger and more complex than its alternatives, encompassing concepts like hooks, context, reducers, and memoization patterns that require careful management to avoid pitfalls. This expansive API contributes to higher cognitive load for developers, often leading to bugs from misunderstood dependencies or over-engineering. For example, in Cloudflare’s September 12, 2025 outage, a useEffect hook with a problematic dependency array triggered repeated API calls, overwhelming their Tenant Service and causing widespread failures. In contrast, frameworks like Svelte, Solid, and Qwik feature smaller, more focused APIs that emphasize simplicity and web fundamentals, reducing the mental overhead and making them easier to master and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Network Effect Prison&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React’s dominance creates self-reinforcing barriers. Job postings ask for “React developers” rather than “frontend engineers,” limiting skill diversity. Component libraries and team muscle memory create institutional inertia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Risk-averse leaders choose the “safe” option. Schools teach what jobs ask for. The cycle continues independent of technical merit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not healthy competition; it’s ecosystem capture by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Breaking the Network Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Escaping requires deliberate action at multiple levels. Technical leaders should choose based on constraints and merits, not momentum. Companies can allocate a small innovation budget to trying alternatives. Developers can upskill beyond a single mental model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Educators can teach framework-agnostic concepts alongside specific tools. Open source contributors can help alternative ecosystems mature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change won’t happen automatically. It requires conscious choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Framework Evaluation Checklist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make deliberate choices, use this simple checklist when starting a new project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assess Performance Needs: Evaluate metrics like startup time, update efficiency, and bundle size. Prioritize frameworks with compile-time optimizations if speed is critical.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team Skills and Learning Curve: Consider existing expertise but factor in migration paths; many alternatives offer gentle ramps (e.g., Solid’s JSX compatibility with React).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scaling and Cost of Ownership: Calculate long-term costs, including maintenance, dependency management, and tech debt. Alternatives often reduce runtime overhead, lowering hosting costs and improving scalability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ecosystem Fit: Balance maturity with innovation; pilot in non-critical areas to test migration feasibility and ROI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Standard Counter‑Arguments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But ecosystem maturity!” Maturity is valuable, and can also entrench inertia. Age isn’t the same as fitness for today’s constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a mature ecosystem often means heavy reliance on third-party packages, which can introduce maintenance burdens like keeping dependencies up-to-date, dealing with security vulnerabilities, and bloating bundles with unused code. While essential in some cases, this flexibility can lead to over-dependence; custom solutions tailored to specific needs are often leaner and more maintainable in the long run. Smaller ecosystems in alternative frameworks encourage building from fundamentals, fostering deeper understanding and less technical debt. Moreover, with AI coding assistants now able to generate precise, custom functions on demand, the barrier to creating bespoke utilities has lowered dramatically. This makes it feasible to avoid generic libraries like lodash or date libraries like Moment or date-fns entirely in favor of lightweight, app-specific implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But hiring!” Hiring follows demand. You can de‑risk by piloting alternatives in non‑critical paths, then hiring for fundamentals plus on‑the‑job training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But component libraries!” Framework‑agnostic design systems and Web Components reduce lock-in while preserving velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But stability!” React’s evolution from classes to hooks to Server Components demonstrates constant churn, not stability. Alternative frameworks often provide more consistent APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But proven at scale!” jQuery was proven at scale too. Past success doesn’t guarantee future relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Broader Ecosystem Harm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monoculture slows web evolution when one framework’s constraints become de facto limits. Talent spends cycles solving framework-specific issues rather than pushing the platform forward. Investment follows incumbents regardless of technical merit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curricula optimize for immediate employability over fundamentals, creating framework-specific rather than transferable skills. Platform improvements get delayed because “React can handle it” becomes a default answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire ecosystem suffers when diversity disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Garden We Could Grow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Healthy ecosystems require diversity, not monocultures. Innovation emerges when different approaches compete and cross-pollinate. Developers grow by learning multiple mental models. The platform improves when several frameworks push different boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Betting everything on one model creates a single point of failure. What happens if it hits hard limits? What opportunities are we missing by not exploring alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s time to choose frameworks based on constraints and merit rather than momentum. Your next project deserves better than React-by-default. The ecosystem deserves the innovation only diversity can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop planting the same seed by default. The garden we could cultivate through diverse framework exploration would be more resilient and more innovative than the monoculture we’ve drifted into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The choice is ours to make.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Hosting a WebSite on a Disposable Vape&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Preface#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is NOT served from a web server running on a disposable vape. If you want to see the real deal, click here. The content is otherwise identical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Background#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I have been collecting disposable vapes from friends and family. Initially, I only salvaged the batteries for “future” projects (It’s not hoarding, I promise), but recently, disposable vapes have gotten more advanced. I wouldn’t want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as “disposable”. Thankfully, I don’t plan on pursuing law anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, I was tearing apart some of these fancier pacifiers for adults when I noticed something that caught my eye, instead of the expected black blob of goo hiding some ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) I see a little integrated circuit inscribed “PUYA”. I don’t blame you if this name doesn’t excite you as much it does me, most people have never heard of them. They are most well known for their flash chips, but I first came across them after reading Jay Carlson’s blog post about the cheapest flash microcontroller you can buy. They are quite capable little ARM Cortex-M0+ micros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year I have collected quite a few of these PY32 based vapes, all of them from different models of vape from the same manufacturer. It’s not my place to do free advertising for big tobacco, so I won’t mention the brand I got it from, but if anyone who worked on designing them reads this, thanks for labeling the debug pins!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What are we working with#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip is marked &lt;code&gt;PUYA C642F15&lt;/code&gt;, which wasn’t very helpful. I was pretty sure it was a &lt;code&gt;PY32F002A&lt;/code&gt;, but after poking around with pyOCD, I noticed that the flash was 24k and we have 3k of RAM. The extra flash meant that it was more likely a &lt;code&gt;PY32F002B&lt;/code&gt;, which is actually a very different chip.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here are the specs of a microcontroller so bad, it’s basically disposable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;24MHz Coretex M0+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;24KiB of Flash Storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3KiB of Static RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a few peripherals, none of which we will use.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may look at those specs and think that it’s not much to work with. I don’t blame you, a 10y old phone can barely load google, and this is about 100x slower. I on the other hand see a blazingly fast web server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Getting online#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of hosting a web server on a vape didn’t come to me instantly. In fact, I have been playing around with them for a while, but after writing my post on semihosting, the penny dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel like reading that article, semihosting is basically syscalls for embedded ARM microcontrollers. You throw some values/pointers into some registers and call a breakpoint instruction. An attached debugger interprets the values in the registers and performs certain actions. Most people just use this to get some logs printed from the microcontroller, but they are actually bi-directional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are older than me, you might remember a time before Wi-Fi and Ethernet, the dark ages, when you had to use dial-up modems to get online. You might also know that the ghosts of those modems still linger all around us. Almost all USB serial devices actually emulate those modems: a 56k modem is just 57600 baud serial device. Data between some of these modems was transmitted using a protocol called SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may not come as a surprise, but Linux (and with some tweaking even macOS) supports SLIP. The &lt;code&gt;slattach&lt;/code&gt; utility can make any &lt;code&gt;/dev/tty*&lt;/code&gt; send and receive IP packets. All we have to do is put the data down the wire in the right format and provide a virtual tty.
This is actually easier than you might imagine, pyOCD can forward all semihosting though a telnet port. Then, we use &lt;code&gt;socat&lt;/code&gt; to link that port to a virtual tty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pyocd gdb -S -O semihost_console_type=telnet -T $(PORT) $(PYOCDFLAGS) &amp;amp;
socat PTY,link=$(TTY),raw,echo=0 TCP:localhost:$(PORT),nodelay &amp;amp;
sudo slattach -L -p slip -s 115200 $(TTY) &amp;amp;
sudo ip addr add 192.168.190.1 peer 192.168.190.2/24 dev sl0
sudo ip link set mtu 1500 up dev sl0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so we have a “modem”, but that’s hardly a web server. To actually talk TCP/IP, we need an IP stack. There are many choices, but I went with uIP because it’s pretty small, doesn’t require an RTOS, and it’s easy to port to other platforms. It also, helpfully, comes with a very minimal HTTP server example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After porting the SLIP code to use semihosting, I had a working web server&amp;amp;mldr;half of the time. As with most highly optimised libraries, uIP was designed for 8 and 16-bit machines, which rarely have memory alignment requirements. On ARM however, if you dereference a &lt;code&gt;u16 *&lt;/code&gt;, you better hope that address is even, or you’ll get an exception. The &lt;code&gt;uip_chksum&lt;/code&gt; assumed &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt; alignment, but the script that creates the filesystem didn’t.
I actually decided to modify a bit the structure of the filesystem to make it a bit more portable.
This was my first time working with &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; and I have to say, it’s quite well suited to this kind of task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Blazingly fast#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how fast is a web server running on a disposable microcontroller. Well, initially, not very fast. Pings took ~1.5s with 50% packet loss and a simple page took over 20s to load. That’s so bad, it’s actually funny, and I kind of wanted to leave it there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the problem was actually between the seat and the steering wheel the whole time. The first implementation read and wrote a single character at a time, which had a massive overhead associated with it. I previously benchmarked semihosting on this device, and I was getting ~20KiB/s, but uIP’s SLIP implementation was designed for very low memory devices, so it was serialising the data byte by byte. We have a whopping 3kiB of RAM to play with, so I added a ring buffer to cache reads from the host and feed them into the SLIP poll function. I also split writes in batches to allow for escaping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now this is what I call blazingly fast! Pings now take 20ms, no packet loss and a full page loads in about 160ms. This was using using almost all of the RAM, but I could also dial down the sizes of the buffer to have more than enough headroom to run other tasks. The project repo has everything set to a nice balance latency and RAM usage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:        5116 B        24 KB     20.82%
             RAM:        1380 B         3 KB     44.92%
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this blog however, I paid for none of the RAM, so I’ll use all of the RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, we have just under 20kiB (80%) of storage space. That may not be enough to ship all of React, but as you can see, it’s more than enough to host this entire blog post. And this is not just a static page server, you can run any server-side code you want, if you know C that is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just for fun, I added a json api endpoint to get the number of requests to the main page (since the last crash) and the unique ID of the microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Addendum to GPT-5 system card: GPT-5-Codex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5-Codex is a version of GPT‑5 optimized for agentic coding in Codex. Like its predecessor, codex-1, this model was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world coding tasks in a variety of environments to generate code that closely mirrors human style and PR preferences, adhere precisely to instructions, and iteratively run tests until passing results are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This model is available locally in the terminal or IDE through Codex CLI and IDE extension, and on the cloud via the Codex web, GitHub, and the ChatGPT mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This addendum outlines the comprehensive safety measures implemented for GPT‑5-Codex. It details both model-level mitigations, such as specialized safety training for harmful tasks and prompt injections, and product-level mitigations like agent sandboxing and configurable network access.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Report&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interactive&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBO projects that the U.S. population will increase from 350 million people in 2025 to 367 million people in 2055. It will be smaller and grow more slowly over the next 30 years, on average, than the agency previously projected it would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Congressional Budget Office periodically updates its demographic outlook to reflect recent developments and changes in laws and policies. The agency last published its demographic projections in January 2025. Since then, CBO has incorporated new data and reduced its estimates of net immigration over the 2025–2033 period and fertility over the 2025–2055 period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Administrative actions taken since January 20, 2025, are the largest factor decreasing CBO's projections of the number of immigrants in the country. The 2025 reconciliation act (Public Law 119-21) also decreases that number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBO now projects that the U.S. population will increase from 350 million people in 2025 to 367 million people in 2055. It will be smaller and grow more slowly over the next 30 years, on average, than the agency previously projected it would. Those changes stem from lower projected net immigration through 2033 and lower fertility rates over the 2025–2055 period than the agency projected in January. In CBO's current projections, the population in 2035 is 4.5 million people smaller (or 1.2 percent) than it was projected to be in the agency's January projections. That difference grows to 5.4 million people (or 1.5 percent) in 2055. The population contains fewer people ages 25 to 54—the age group that is most likely to participate in the labor force—than the agency previously projected. Deaths are projected to exceed births in 2031, two years earlier than previously projected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBO's population projections are highly uncertain, especially in the later years of the 2025–2055 period. If rates of fertility, mortality, or net immigration are higher or lower than CBO projects, the resulting population will differ in size and composition from the one described here. For example, immigration could differ significantly from CBO's projections because of future legislative or administrative changes, which are not incorporated into the current projections. The effects of such differences would be larger in later years because the differences would compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
