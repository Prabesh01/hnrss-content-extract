  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of staring down the world’s biggest tech companies and setting the bar for tough regulation worldwide, Europe has blinked. Under intense pressure from industry and the US government, Brussels is stripping protections from its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — including simplifying its infamous cookie permission pop-ups — and relaxing or delaying landmark AI rules in an effort to cut red tape and revive sluggish economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Europe is scaling back its landmark privacy and AI laws&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The changes, proposed by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, changes core elements of the GDPR, making it easier for companies to share anonymized and pseudonymized personal datasets. They would allow AI companies to legally use personal data to train AI models, so long as that training complies with other GDPR requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal also waters down a key part of Europe’s sweeping artificial intelligence rules, the AI Act, which came into force in 2024 but had many elements that would only come into effect later. The change extends the grace period for rules governing high-risk AI systems that pose “serious risks” to health, safety, or fundamental rights, which were due to come into effect next summer. The rules will now only apply once it’s confirmed that “the needed standards and support tools are available” to AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One change that’s likely to please almost everyone is a reduction in Europe’s ubiquitous cookie banners and pop-ups. Under the new proposal, some “non-risk” cookies won’t trigger pop-ups at all, and users would be able to control others from central browser controls that apply to websites broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other amendments in the new Digital Omnibus include simplified AI documentation requirements for smaller companies, a unified interface for companies to report cybersecurity incidents, and centralizing oversight of AI into the bloc’s AI Office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is being done in the European way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have all the ingredients in the EU to succeed. But our companies, especially our start-ups and small businesses, are often held back by layers of rigid rules,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for tech sovereignty at the European Commission. “By cutting red tape, simplifying EU laws, opening access to data and introducing a common European Business Wallet we are giving space for innovation to happen and to be marketed in Europe. This is being done in the European way: by making sure that fundamental rights of users remain fully protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal now heads to the European Parliament and the EU’s 27 member states — where it will need a qualified majority — for approval, a process that could drag on for months and potentially introduce significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed overhaul won’t land quietly in Brussels, and if the development of the GDPR and AI Act are anything to go by, a political and lobbying firestorm is on its way. The GDPR is a cornerstone of Europe’s tech strategy and as close to sacred as a policy can be. Leaked drafts have already provoked outrage among civil rights groups and politicians, who have accused the Commission of weakening fundamental safeguards and bowing to pressure from Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision follows months of intense pressure from Big Tech and Donald Trump — as well as high-profile internal figures like ex-Italian prime minister and former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi — urging the bloc to weaken burdensome tech regulation. The Commission has sought to frame the changes as simplifying the EU’s tech laws, not weakening them – a way of soothing growing fears in Brussels that its tough rules are hampering its ability to compete globally. With very few exceptions, Europe doesn’t have any credible competitors in the global AI race, which is dominated by US and Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, our new frontier agentic coding model, available in Codex today. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built on an update to our foundational reasoning model, which is trained on agentic tasks across software engineering, math, research, and more. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is faster, more intelligent, and more token-efficient at every stage of the development cycle–and a new step towards becoming a reliable coding partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built for long-running, detailed work. It’s our first model natively trained to operate across multiple context windows through a process called compaction, coherently working over millions of tokens in a single task. This unlocks project-scale refactors, deep debugging sessions, and multi-hour agent loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex today for use in the CLI, IDE extension, cloud, and code review, and API access is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max was trained on real-world software engineering tasks, like PR creation, code review, frontend coding, and Q&amp;amp;A and outperforms our previous models on many frontier coding evaluations. The model’s gains on benchmarks also come with improvements to real-world usage: GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is the first model we have trained to operate in Windows environments, and the model’s training now includes tasks designed to make it a better collaborator in the Codex CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows significant improvements in token efficiency due to more effective reasoning. On SWE-bench Verified, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max with ‘medium’ reasoning effort achieves better performance than GPT‑5.1-Codex with the same reasoning effort, while using 30% fewer thinking tokens. For non-latency-sensitive tasks, we’re also introducing a new Extra High (‘xhigh’) reasoning effort, which thinks for an even longer period of time for a better answer. We still recommend medium as the daily driver for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect the token efficiency improvements to translate to real-world savings for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is able to produce high quality frontend designs with similar functionality and aesthetics, but at much lower cost than GPT‑5.1-Codex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Prompt:&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt; Generate a single self-contained browser app that renders an interactive CartPole RL sandbox with canvas graphics, a tiny policy-gradient controller, metrics, and an SVG network visualizer.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Features&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Must be able to actually train a policy to make model better at cart pole&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Visualizer for the activations/weights when the model is training or at inference&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Steps in the episode, rewards this episode&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Last survival time and best survival time in steps&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Save to index.html&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compaction enables GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max to complete tasks that would have previously failed due to context-window limits, such as complex refactors and long-running agent loops by pruning its history while preserving the most important context over long horizons. In Codex applications, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max automatically compacts its session when it approaches its context window limit, giving it a fresh context window. It repeats this process until the task is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to sustain coherent work over long horizons is a foundational capability on the path toward more general, reliable AI systems. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max can work independently for hours at a time. In our internal evaluations, we’ve observed GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max work on tasks for more than 24 hours. It will persistently iterate on its implementation, fix test failures, and ultimately deliver a successful result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max performs significantly better on evaluations that require sustained, long-horizon reasoning. Because it can coherently work across multiple context windows using compaction, the model delivers improved results on challenges in areas like long-horizon coding and cybersecurity. We analyzed the results of this model’s performance on first- and third-party evaluations in the GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max does not reach High capability on Cybersecurity under our Preparedness Framework but it is the most capable cybersecurity model we’ve deployed to date and agentic cybersecurity capabilities are rapidly evolving. As a result, we are taking steps to prepare for High capability on Cybersecurity and are enhancing our safeguards in the cyber domain and working to ensure that defenders can benefit from these improved capabilities through programs like Aardvark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we launched GPT‑5-Codex, we implemented dedicated cybersecurity-specific monitoring to detect and disrupt malicious activity. While we have not observed a meaningful increase in scaled abuse, we are preparing additional mitigations for advanced capabilities. Our teams have already disrupted cyber operations attempting to misuse our models, and suspicious activity is routed for review through our policy monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is designed to run in a secure sandbox by default: file writes are limited to its workspace, and network access is disabled unless a developer turns it on. We recommend keeping Codex in this restricted-access mode, since enabling internet or web search can introduce prompt-injection risks from untrusted content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Codex becomes more capable of long-running tasks, it is increasingly important for developers to review the agent’s work before making changes or deploying to production. To assist with this, Codex produces terminal logs and cites its tool calls and test results. While its code reviews reduce the risk of deploying model or human produced bugs to production, Codex should be treated as an additional reviewer and not a replacement for human reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity capabilities can be used for both defense and offense, so we take an iterative deployment approach: learning from real-world use, updating safeguards, and preserving important defensive tools such as automated vulnerability scanning and remediation assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans. For details on how usage limits work for your plan, please see our docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers using Codex CLI via API key, we plan to make GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max available in the API soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model in Codex surfaces. Unlike GPT‑5.1, which is a general-purpose model, we recommend using GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max and the Codex family of models only for agentic coding tasks in Codex or Codex-like environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows how far models have come in sustaining long-horizon coding tasks, managing complex workflows, and producing high-quality implementations with far fewer tokens. We’ve seen the model combined with steady upgrades to our CLI, IDE extension, cloud integration, and code review tooling result in supercharged engineering productivity: internally, 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex weekly, and these engineers ship roughly 70% more pull requests since adopting Codex. As we push the frontier of what agents are able to do, we’re excited to see what you'll build with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The lost cause of the Lisp machines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am just really bored by Lisp Machine romantics at this point: they should go away. I expect they never will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;History&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Symbolics went bankrupt in early 1993. In the way of these things various remnants of the company lingered on for, in this case, decades. But 1983 was when the Lisp Machines died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The death was not unexpected: by the time I started using mainstream Lisps in 19891 everyone knew that special hardware for Lisp was a dead idea. The common idea was that the arrival of RISC machines had killed it, but in fact machines like the Sun 3/260 in its ‘AI’ configuration2 were already hammering nails in its coffin. In 1987 I read a report showing the Lisp performance of an early RISC machine, using Kyoto Common Lisp, not a famously fast implementation of CL, beating a Symbolics on the Gabriel benchmarks [PDF link].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1993 is 32 years ago. The Symbolics 3600, probably the first Lisp machine that sold in more than tiny numbers, was introduced in 1983, ten years earlier. People who used Lisp machines other than as historical artefacts are old today3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp machines were both widely available and offered the best performance for Lisp for a period of about five years which ended nearly forty years ago. They were probably never competitive in terms of performance for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is time, and long past time, to let them go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But still the romantics — some of them even old enough to remember the Lisp machines — repeat their myths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘It was the development environment’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development environments offered by both families of Lisp machines were seriously cool, at least for the 1980s. I mean, they really were very cool indeed. Some of the ways they were cool matter today, but some don’t. For instance in the 1980s and early 1990s Lisp images were very large compared to available memory, and machines were also extremely slow in general. So good Lisp development environents did a lot of work to hide this slowness, and in general making sure you only very seldom had to restart everthing, which took significant fractions of an hour, if not more. None of that matters today, because machines are so quick and Lisps so relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only way they were cool. They really were just lovely things to use in many ways. But, despite what people might believe: this did not depend on the hardware: there is no reason at all why a development environent that cool could not be built on stock hardware. Perhaps, (perhaps) that was not true in 1990: it is certainly true today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if a really cool Lisp development environment doesn’t exist today, it is nothing to do with Lisp machines not existing. In fact, as someone who used Lisp machines, I find the LispWorks development environment at least as comfortable and productive as they were. But, oh no, the full-fat version is not free, and no version is open source. Neither, I remind you, were they.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘They were much faster than anything else’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, they weren’t. Please, stop with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘The hardware was user-microcodable, you see’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please, stop telling me things about machines I used: believe it or not, I know those things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many machines were user-microcodable before about 1990. That meant that, technically, a user of the machine could implement their own instruction set. I am sure there are cases where people even did that, and a much smaller number of cases where doing that was not just a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in almost all cases the only people who wrote microcode were the people who built the machine. And the reason they wrote microcode was because it is the easiest way of implementing a very complex instruction set, especially when you can’t use vast numbers of transistors. For instance if you’re going to provide an ‘add’ instruction which will add numbers of any type, trapping back into user code for some cases, then by far the easiest way of doing that is going to be by writing code, not building hardware. And that’s what the Lisp machines did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the compiler could have generated that code for hardware without that instruction. But with the special instruction the compiler’s job is much easier, and code is smaller. A small, quick compiler and small compiled code were very important with slow machines which had tiny amounts of memory. Of course a compiler not made of wet string could have used type information to avoid generating the full dispatch case, but wet string was all that was available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What microcodable machines almost never meant was that users of the machines would write microcode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the tradeoffs made by Lisp machines might even have been reasonable. CISC machines in general were probably good compromises given the expense of memory and how rudimentary compilers were: I can remember being horrified at the size of compiled code for RISC machines. But I was horrified because I wasn’t thinking about it properly. Moore’s law was very much in effect in about 1990 and, among other things, it meant that the amount of memory you could afford was rising exponentially with time: the RISC people understood that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘They were Lisp all the way down’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This, finally, maybe, is a good point. They were, and you could dig around and change things on the fly, and this was pretty cool. Sometimes you could even replicate the things you’d done later. I remember playing with sound on a 3645 which was really only possible because you could get low-level access to the disk from Lisp, as the disk could just marginally provide data fast enough to stream sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand they had no isolation and thus no security at all: people didn’t care about that in 1985, but if I was using a Lisp-based machine today I would certainly be unhappy if my web browser could modify my device drivers on the fly, or poke and peek at network buffers. A machine that was Lisp all the way down today would need to ensure that things like that couldn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So may be it would be Lisp all the way down, but you absolutely would not have the kind of ability to poke around in and redefine parts of the guts you had on Lisp machines. Maybe that’s still worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not to mention that I’m just not very interested in spending a huge amount of time grovelling around in the guts of something like an SSL implementation: those things exist already, and I’d rather do something new and cool. I’d rather do something that Lisp is uniquely suited for, not reinvent wheels. Well, may be that’s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Machines which were Lisp all the way down might, indeed, be interesting, although they could not look like 1980s Lisp machines if they were to be safe. But that does not mean they would need special hardware for Lisp: they wouldn’t. If you want something like this, hardware is not holding you back: there’s no need to endlessly mourn the lost age of Lisp machines, you can start making one now. Shut up and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we come to the really strange arguments, the arguments that we need special Lisp machines either for reasons which turn out to be straightforwardly false, or because we need something that Lisp machines never were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘Good Lisp compilers are too hard to write for stock hardware’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mantra is getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important thing is that we have good stock-hardware Lisp compilers today. As an example, today’s CL compilers are not far from CLANG/LLVM for floating-point code. I tested SBCL and LispWorks: it would be interesting to know how many times more work has gone into LLVM than them for such a relatively small improvement. I can’t imagine a world where these two CL compilers would not be at least comparable to LLVM if similar effort was spent on them4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These things are so much better than the wet-cardboard-and-string compilers that the LispMs had it’s not funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A large amount of work is also going into compilation for other dynamically-typed, interactive languages which aim at high performance. That means on-the-fly compilation and recompilation of code where both the compilation and the resulting code must be quick. Example: Julia. Any of that development could be reused by Lisp compiler writers if they needed to or wanted to (I don’t know if they do, or should).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, but then it turns out that that’s not what is meant by a ‘good compiler’ after all. It turns out that ‘good’ means ‘compillation is fast’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All these compilers are pretty quick: the computational resources used by even a pretty hairy compiler have not scaled anything like as fast as those needed for the problems we want to solve (that’s why Julia can use LLVM on the fly). Compilation is also not an Amdahl bottleneck as it can happen on the node that needs the compiled code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compilers are so quick that a widely-used CL implementation exists where EVAL uses the compiler, unless you ask it not to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compilation options are also a thing: you can ask compilers to be quick, fussy, sloppy, safe, produce fast code and so on. Some radically modern languages also allow this to be done in a standardised (but extensible) way at the language level, so you can say ‘make this inner loop really quick, and I have checked all the bounds so don’t bother with that’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tradeoff between a fast Lisp compiler and a really good Lisp compiler is imaginary, at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘They had wonderful keyboards’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, if you didn’t mind the weird layouts: yes, they did5. And has exactly nothing to do with Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bored now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a well-known syndrome amongst photographers and musicians called GAS: gear acquisition syndrome. Sufferers from this6 pursue an endless stream of purchases of gear — cameras, guitars, FX pedals, the last long-expired batch of a legendary printing paper — in the strange hope that the next camera, the next pedal, that paper, will bring out the Don McCullin, Jimmy Page or Chris Killip in them. Because, of course, Don McCullin &amp;amp; Chris Killip only took the pictures they did because he had the right cameras: it was nothing to do with talent, practice or courage, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GAS is a lie we tell ourselves to avoid the awkward reality that what we actually need to do is practice, a lot, and that even if we did that we might not actually be very talented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp machine romanticism is the same thing: a wall we build ourself so that, somehow unable to climb over it or knock it down, we never have to face the fact that the only thing stopping us is us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no purpose to arguing with Lisp machine romantics because they will never accept that the person building the endless barriers in their way is the same person they see in the mirror every morning. They’re too busy building the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a footnote, I went to a talk by an HPC person in the early 90s (so: after the end of the cold war7 and when the HPC money had gone) where they said that HPC people needed to be aiming at machines based on what big commercial systems looked like as nobody was going to fund dedicated HPC designs any more. At the time that meant big cache-coherent SMP systems. Those hit their limits and have really died out now: the bank I worked for had dozens of fully-populated big SMP systems in 2007, it perhaps still has one or two they can’t get rid of because of some legacy application. So HPC people now run on enormous shared-nothing farms of close-to-commodity processors with very fat interconnect and are wondering about / using GPUs. That’s similar to what happened to Lisp systems, of course: perhaps, in the HPC world, there are romantics who mourn the lost glories of the Cray–3. Well, if I was giving a talk to people interested in the possibilities of hardware today I’d be saying that in a few years there are going to be a lot of huge farms of GPUs going very cheap if you can afford the power. People could be looking at whether those can be used for anything more interesting than the huge neural networks they were designed for. I don’t know if they can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before that I had read about Common Lisp but actually written programs in Cambridge Lisp and Standard Lisp. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This had a lot of memory and a higher-resolution screen, I think, and probably was bundled with a rebadged Lucid Common Lisp. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am at the younger end of people who used these machines in anger: I was not there for the early part of the history described here, and I was also not in the right part of the world at a time when that mattered more. But I wrote Lisp from about 1985 and used Lisp machines of both families from 1989 until the mid to late 1990s. I know from first-hand experience what these machines were like. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If anyone has good knowledge of Arm64 (specifically Apple M1) assembler and performance, and the patience to pore over a couple of assembler listings and work out performance differences, please get in touch. I have written most of a document exploring the difference in performance, but I lost the will to live at the point where it came down to understanding just what details made the LLVM code faster. All the compilers seem to do a good job of the actual float code, but perhaps things like array access or loop overhead are a little slower in Lisp. The difference between SBCL &amp;amp; LLVM is a factor of under 1.2. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Sun type 3 keyboard was both wonderful and did not have a weird layout, so there’s that. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am one: I know what I’m talking about here. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Blackouts led to loss of steering and propulsion on 984-foot-long vessel&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Nov. 18, 2025) -- The NTSB said Tuesday that a single loose wire on the 984-foot-long containership Dali caused an electrical blackout that led to the giant vessel veering and contacting the nearby Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which then collapsed, killing six highway workers. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At Tuesday’s public meeting at NTSB headquarters, investigators said the loose wire in the ship’s electrical system caused a breaker to unexpectedly open -- beginning a sequence of events that led to two vessel blackouts and a loss of both propulsion and steering near the 2.37-mile-long Key Bridge on March 26, 2024. Investigators found that wire-label banding prevented the wire from being fully inserted into a terminal block spring-clamp gate, causing an inadequate connection. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p/&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Illustration showing how placement of wire-label banding affects the way wires are seated in their terminal blocks. (Source: NTSB) &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After the initial blackout, the Dali’s heading began swinging to starboard toward Pier 17 of the Key Bridge. Investigators found that the pilots and the bridge team attempted to change the vessel’s trajectory, but the loss of propulsion so close to the bridge rendered their actions ineffective. A substantial portion of the bridge subsequently collapsed into the river, and portions of the pier, deck and truss spans collapsed onto the vessel’s bow and forwardmost container bays. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A seven-person road maintenance crew and one inspector were on the bridge when the vessel struck. Six of the highway workers died. The NTSB found that the quick actions of the Dali pilots, shoreside dispatchers and the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop bridge traffic prevented greater loss of life. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;”Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,’ said NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. “The Dali, at almost 1,000 feet, is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high, with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“But like all of the accidents we investigate,this was preventable,” Homendy said. “Implementing NTSB recommendations in this investigation will prevent similar tragedies in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Contributing to the collapse of the Key Bridge and the loss of life was the lack of countermeasures to reduce the bridge’s vulnerability to collapse due to impact by ocean-going vessels, which have only grown larger since the Key Bridge’s opening in 1977. When the Japan-flagged containership Blue Nagoya contacted the Key Bridge after losing propulsion in 1980, the 390-foot-long vessel caused only minor damage. The Dali, however, is 10 times the size of the Blue Nagoya. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As part of the investigation, the NTSB in March released an initial report on the vulnerability of bridges nationwide to large vessel strikes. The report found that the Maryland Transportation Authority—and many other owners of bridges spanning navigable waterways used by ocean-going vessels—were likely unaware of the potential risk that a vessel collision could pose to their structures. This was despite longstanding guidance from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommending that bridge owners perform these assessments. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The NTSB sent letters to 30 bridge owners identified in the report, urging them to evaluate their bridges and, if needed, develop plans to reduce risks. All recipients have since responded, and the status of each recommendation is available on the NTSB’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; As a result of the investigation, the NTSB issued new safety recommendations to the US Coast Guard; US Federal Highway Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK); the American National Standards Institute; the American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee on Safety in Construction and Demolitions Operations A10; HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd; and WAGO Corporation, the electrical component manufacturer; and multiple bridge owners across the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A synopsis of actions taken Tuesday, including the probable cause, findings and recommendations, can be found on ntsb.gov. The complete investigation report will be released in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT-Security Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research identified and responsibly disclosed a large-scale privacy weakness in WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism that allowed the enumeration of 3.5 billion accounts. In collaboration with the researchers, Meta has since addressed and mitigated the issue. The study underscores the importance of continuous, independent security research on widely used communication platforms and highlights the risks associated with the centralization of instant messaging services. The preprint of the study has now been published, and the results will be presented in 2026 at the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism can use a user's address book to find other WhatsApp users by their phone number. Using the same underlying mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to query more than 100 million phone numbers per hour through WhatsApp's infrastructure, confirming more than 3.5 billion active accounts across 245 countries. "Normally, a system shouldn't respond to such a high number of requests in such a short time — particularly when originating from a single source," explains lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna. "This behavior exposed the underlying flaw, which allowed us to issue an effectively unlimited requests to the server and, in doing so, map user data worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accessible data items used in the study are the same that are public for anyone who knows a user's phone number and consist of: phone number, public keys, timestamps, and, if set to public, about text and profile picture. From these data points, the researchers were able to extract additional information, which allowed them to infer a user's operating system, account age, as well as the number of linked companion devices. The study shows that even this limited amount of data per user can reveal important information, both on macroscopic and individual levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The study also revealed a range of broader insights:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Millions of active WhatsApp accounts were identified in countries where the platform was officially banned, including China, Iran, and Myanmar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Population-level insights into platform usage, such as the global distribution of Android (81%) versus iOS (19%) devices, regional differences in privacy behavior (e.g., use of public profile pictures or "about" tagline), and variations in user growth across countries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A small number of cases showed re-use of cryptographic keys across different devices or phone numbers, pointing to potential weaknesses in non-official WhatsApp clients or fraudulent use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nearly half of all phone numbers that appeared in the 2021 Facebook data leak of 500 million phone numbers (caused by a scraping incident in 2018) were still active on WhatsApp. This highlights the enduring risks for leaked numbers (e.g., being targeted in scam calls) associated with such exposures.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study did not involve access to message content, and no personal data was published or shared. All retrieved data was deleted by the researchers prior to publication. Message content on WhatsApp is “end-to-end encrypted” and was not affected at any time. “This end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, but not necessarily the associated metadata,” explains last author Aljosha Judmayer from the University of Vienna. “Our work shows that privacy risks can also arise when such metadata is collected and analysed on a large scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These findings remind us that even mature, widely trusted systems can contain design or implementation flaws that have real-world consequences," says lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna: "They show that security and privacy are not one-time achievements, but must be continuously re-evaluated as technology evolves."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Building on our previous findings on delivery receipts and key management, we are contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve and where new risks arise," adds co-author Maximilian Günther from the University of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are grateful to the University of Vienna researchers for their responsible partnership and diligence under our Bug Bounty program. This collaboration successfully identified a novel enumeration technique that surpassed our intended limits, allowing the researchers to scrape basic publicly available information. We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses. Importantly, the researchers have securely deleted the data collected as part of the study, and we have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp’s default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers”, says Nitin Gupta, Vice President of Engineering at WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ethical Handling and Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was conducted with strict ethical guidelines and in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. The findings were promptly reported to Meta, the operator of WhatsApp, which has since implemented countermeasures (e.g., rate-limiting, stricter profile information visibility) to close the identified vulnerability. The authors argue that transparency, academic scrutiny, and independent testing are essential to maintaining trust in global communication services. They emphasize that proactive collaboration between researchers and industry can significantly improve user privacy and prevent abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Research Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This publication represents the third study by researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research examining the security and privacy of prevalent instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Signal. The team investigates how design and implementation choices in end-to-end encrypted messaging services can unintentionally expose user information or weaken privacy guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the researchers published "Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers" (distinguished with the Best Paper Award at RAID 2025), which demonstrated how silent pings and their delivery receipts could be abused to infer user activity patterns and online behavior on WhatsApp and similar messaging platforms. Later that same year, "Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism" (presented at USENIX WOOT 2025) analyzed the cryptographic foundations of WhatsApp's prekey distribution mechanism, revealing implementation weaknesses of the Signal-based protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By building on our earlier findings about delivery receipts and key management, we're contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve, and where new risks emerge." said Maximilian Günther (University of Vienna).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current study, "Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy", extends this line of research to the global scope, showing how contact discovery mechanisms can unintentionally allow large-scale user enumeration at an unprecedented magnitude. It will appear in the proceedings of the NDSS Symposium 2026, one of the leading international conferences on computer and network security.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Attendance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m in Introduction to Algorithms (577) this semester at UW, and I’ve been enjoying hearing Renault explaining how to prove program correctness, DP, network flow, and the circumstances under which Dijkstra invented his shortest-path algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However… algos is a somewhat unique class for me, given that it’s the first course I’ve taken that mandates being present during lectures by taking attendance. It accomplishes this through a platform called TopHat, who many students will recognize through its use of displaying participation questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TopHat asks you to provide it a four-length numerical code (that’ll be provided to you by your lecturer) in order to verify that you’re actually in the location where the attendance is being taken. You type that code into the student TopHat page, and, bam, you’re marked present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I suppose they caught on to the unpatchable strategy of Having Friends, who, given that they are in the same class section as you, can be sent messages begging for the code from the comfort of your bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for the paranoid lecturer, TopHat allows “secure attendance”, a feature which, according to them, determines your location as “…determined by [your] device geolocation or by both geolocation and proximity (to the classroom and other students).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about this system, I wondered how much leeway this “geolocation” would afford you. There exist a plethora of traditional “IP geolocation” services, which use your IP address and ASN — both semi-unique identifiers sent to the webpage upon load — to try and identify your location. This provides… varied results depending on where you’re located. When in Madison and NYC, popular IP geolocation services have been able to pin me within a mile or so of my actual location. In any suburban area, the error jumps to city-level.1 Surely TopHat wouldn’t be relying on such an inaccurate measure of detecting location when determining attendance — students living in Chadbourne Hall taking lectures in Mosse Humanities (approx. 250ft apart) would be able to skirt the attendance requirement. That could be catastrophic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#The Geolocation API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, it is not IP geolocation being used by TopHat. As aforementioned, IP geolocation is a pretty implicit flow — webpages are able to see your IP when you connect to them. However, when trying to determine your location, TopHat pops up a big scary dialogue past the line of death!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly this is asking something else entirely — something that’s presumably so precise as to require my explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you the suspense. This is the Geolocation API, a feature of all modern browsers that allows the retrieval of your location to a much more precise degree (hence the permission pop-up). As of writing this post, IP geolocation is enough to place me somewhere in the Lakeshore neighborhood of Madison (1-2 miles long), but Chrome’s Geolocation API is enough to pin me to the exact building — Morgridge Hall — I’m sitting in. That’s orders of magnitude more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first experienced my laptop doing this, my first thought was “How?” There’s nothing special that my laptop has access to that would somehow allow my browser to have a more specific location… right? My laptop doesn’t have a GPS receiver in it2 that would allow location identification in the same way that phones can (and it isn’t just piggybacking off of my phone’s GPS, since this same location API is available on Windows devices).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#It’s all of our faults&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you press “allow” on the popup, your browser uses an accuracy heuristic to determine which method fetches the most accurate location. While this could be GPS (if on a cellular-enabled device) or the aforementioned IP geolocation, it will most likely have the highest success with the Wi-Fi Positioning System, a strategy that uses the wireless access points around you to identify your location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works. After allowing your browser permission to access your location, a website has access to the &lt;code&gt;getCurrentPosition()&lt;/code&gt; function. When calling it, your browser kindly asks your operating system for a list of the surrounding Wi-Fi access points — more specifically, their signal strength, SSIDs, and BSSIDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If those last two are foreign to you, the “SSID” of a network is just the friendly name — for example, &lt;code&gt;UWNet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;eduroam&lt;/code&gt;. The BSSID is derived from (but not necessarily the same as) the MAC address of the access point, which is unique per each device. Having a unique identifier per access point is immensely important, as you can imagine just how many APs are named the same thing. Take a look at the map of APs around campus named &lt;code&gt;UWNet&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so, great. We now know exactly which Wi-Fi network you’re connected to. But how does this translate to your location on a map? And how do we even know where these networks are in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Wardriving&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion of associating Wi-Fi networks with their physical locations has been prevalent since the early 2000s. As far as I can tell, Skyhook Wireless were the first to do it on a commercially-available scale, using a technique known as wardriving. This entails getting in a vehicle and driving around while capturing the information of as many Wi-Fi networks as possible. Since the devices doing the network scanning also have a reliable knowledge of their position (through GPS), all you have to do is associate the location of where you saw the network with its signal strength. Some RSSI trilateration later, and you have a roughly accurate map of Wi-Fi networks you’ve seen and their corresponding physical locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The useful thing is that, once in possession of all of this data, you can perform the process in reverse — on a user’s device, send a list of the Wi-Fi networks you can see (and their corresponding RSSI), and receive an approximate guess on where that places your device in the world. For a while, that’s what everyone’s devices (including Apple ones, until iOS 3.2) did, relying on either Skyhook’s or Google’s privately collected list. The latter, interestingly enough, used their Street View vehicles (the ones taking images of roads) to capture the Wi-Fi information for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, at some point, companies realized the potential benefit of sourcing this information from the users of their devices. After all, they’re already frequently checking their GPS location and phoning home to cell towers, so why not send some anonymized Wi-Fi location data along with it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, that’s what Apple, Google, and Microsoft devices began doing. The location services of their products, by default, started aggregating the SSIDs and BSSIDs of Wi-Fi hotspots they could see (and their locations) and logging them for others’ devices to use for more accurate location services. And… that’s more or less the same thing that modern devices use today. When Chrome tells me that a website would like to use my location, and I allow it, the list of the surrounding hotspots will be sent to Google — which, because tens of thousands of people with GPS-enabled devices have also pinged the networks, allows my computer to obtain an extremely accurate estimation on where I am. So, thank you, everybody…?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Controversy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were feeling a little nervous about the idea of your phone aggregating and sharing the location and information of every Wi-Fi network you’ve ever interacted with in your entire life, don’t worry, you’re not alone! There have been plenty of historical incidents with abuses of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with a tough one: remember how earlier (in wardriving) I mentioned that Google historically used their Street View cars to obtain network information for their location services? It turns out that they were sniffing much more than just the headers of the packets — they were aggregating the raw 802.11 Wi-Fi data frames, which includes the non-encrypted payload of HTTP packets. I assume that very little of the internet was using HTTPS in 2010, so the reported 600 gigabytes worth of data they obtained definitely contained some things that users would probably rather them not see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A larger and more pertinent concern tends to crop up with regards to the possibility of tracing someone’s location — which is valid, given its sensitivity. This has been a worry since WPS’ inception, but one older example I found was Elie Bursztein et al.’s talk and accompanying blog post “Using the microsoft geolocalization api to retrace where a windows laptop has been”. At the time, there was a bug where Windows would save a persistent record of every MAC address that you connected to, making it possible to retrace someone’s steps (thus, tracking their location as it changed) using one of numerous location APIs live at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities are even seen in contemporary times — Erik Rye and Dave Levin of the University of Maryland wrote “Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems” in 2024, detailing a flaw in Apple’s location services that allowed them to exfiltrate the positions of nearly two billion BSSIDs by cleverly filtering the MAC address space they were searching. Their paper’s great, and it touches on some real dangers possible from the information in the hands of an adversary, such as stalking individuals by continuously locating their router BSSID, or monitoring population density during wartime by observing the movement of groups of devices (and satellite internet constellations like Starlink).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the location service providers have improved the security of the APIs they develop. This is supremely important given the risks we’ve discussed, especially given that nearly every device created by these companies are, by default3, sending this information to their manufacturers. Nearly every company that participates in WPS allows you to opt your BSSID out — either by changing the name of your SSID or by specifying the MAC address in a form somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s instructional opt out page (appending &lt;code&gt;_nomap&lt;/code&gt;) to the SSID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s page, which offers the same advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s form, requiring a BSSID submission to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I didn’t mention it yet, this technology does have a name. It’s called the Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS). There’s still a vibrant community of Wi-Fi positioning enthusiasts out there — https://wigle.net/ is a crowd-sourced database from recreational wardrivers who have contributed nearly two billion networks over the last 25 years. You can zoom in on your town and see the Wi-Fi density near you, and you can even check if your own network has been tagged by someone else!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention https://beacondb.net/, a self described “public domain wireless geolocation database”, which, while I haven’t had time to play with, sounds like a very promising open version of the trackers so commonly used nowadays. While it doesn’t have as dense of a database as any of the other providers, I actually think it’s neat to have a lack of homogeneity among the smaller providers — it shows the data is truly different!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been really fun diving down this rabbit hole to learn how our devices gain access to our location. It’s one of the more niche things that I’ve taken for granted when using my devices, and it certainly didn’t occur to me that, while in lecture, the only reason I could be marked present was because thousands of other students had (without their knowledge) pinged servers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This conclusion — “error rates scale based on living settlement density” is my personal conjecture. It is surprisingly frustrating just exactly how little information there is online about how these services attempt to pin your location from just your IP address. Wikipedia has an article about IP geolocation, but it’s vague when discussing the actual implementation details… ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Small digression: did you know that, until May 2000, GPS satellites (which are owned and operated by the United States Space Force) provided the general public a signal with intentional error built into it? This was called Selective Availability, and it augmented the position of GPS readings by about 50 meters (162 feet) horizontally. It was shut off for a number of reasons — one of which being that Differential GPS allows you to circumvent the distortion trivially by comparing the error of the signal against the location of a reference station with a known position. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s associated with “Location Services” on most devices, meaning that you cannot opt out of your phone reporting the locations of surrounding Wi-Fi devices without turning off your phone’s ability to obtain its location entirely. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Act now: continue sending &amp;amp; receiving encrypted messages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2026, we will be rolling out a significant update to strengthen the security of your conversations: unverified devices will no longer be able to send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages via Element. This change follows the Matrix specification update that was announced at the Matrix 2025 conference on October, 17 and benefits everyone by enhancing security, but may require an action from you to continue sending &amp;amp; receiving encrypted messages on your existing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This security update will give you assurance that when you receive a message from a contact, you can effortlessly assume it’s really from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a big step towards making Element an even more safe and reliable messaging experience. We mean it when we say that we want to provide the most secure communication technology in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s what’s changing and why it matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unverified devices are a potential attack vector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re messaging a colleague and suddenly a warning shield icon appears on your screen. Is this just a harmless unverified device and you can safely ignore the warning, or has someone’s account been compromised? At best this is a distraction and, at worst, it is someone malicious trying to impersonate one of your contacts - neither is ideal. What’s worse is that ignoring these warnings leaves unmitigated risks to proliferate throughout your network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Element, trust is critical - a non-negotiable. For example, we provide end-to-end encryption by default to all of our users to ensure that you and the person you're messaging - and only the person you're messaging - can read the messages. This forthcoming change aims to eliminate uncertainty and the likelihood of malicious activity by requiring all devices to be verified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Device verification matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Device verification acts like a hand shake between your devices, proving cryptographically to your contacts that they belong to you. Without this verification step, messages sent from your new devices must be marked as untrusted in your conversations. By making verification mandatory, users can be confident in every message sent and received via Element and are not distracted by warnings about insecure devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trust by design and default&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going forward devices will be either verified or unable to participate in conversations - it’s that simple. No more warning or shield icons that can be easily ignored, these ultimately undermine the impact of important warnings/notifications (users become desensitised).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By verifying your devices, you’re not just protecting your own communications, you’re creating a more trusted environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re designing a system that prioritises the security of your communications and making verification an integral part of the process is a great example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Action required by end users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re already in the habit of verifying your devices and have your recovery key set up there’s nothing you need to do to prepare, you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For everyone else, now is the time to take action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check if your existing devices - mobile, web or desktop - are verified.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set up recovery if you haven’t done that already.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: although setting up recovery is strictly not mandatory, it is highly recommended, as it simplifies the verification of new devices, and enables you to do that even when you lose all of your current devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the details of how to do this on various platforms, please read more in the user documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What if you don’t verify…?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From April 2026:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unverified devices will no longer be able to send messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Content of the messages received from unverified devices will not be shown (you can still see that there was a message).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, unverified devices will effectively become unusable in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) conversations. You’ll still be able to participate in conversations where E2EE has been deactivated, but in all other circumstances you will be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building trust together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As stated above, trust is fundamental to secure communication. By requiring verified devices, we are raising the bar for what users can expect from your secure communication. This is a small change that makes a big difference. We have to work together with our users to ensure success. We’re doing this work to ensure every message you send and receive is as trustworthy as a face-to-face conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re here to make the transition as smooth as possible. If you have questions or need help, our support team is ready to assist. Together, let’s make digital communication as secure as possible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; magic, details about the shebang/hash-bang mechanism
on various Unix flavours&lt;p&gt;2001-08-13 .. 2021-10-20 (see recent changes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you'll find&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See an old mail from Dennis Ritchie introducing the new feature, quoted in 4.0 BSD /usr/src/sys/newsys/sys1.c. &lt;lb/&gt; The path component &lt;code&gt;newsys&lt;/code&gt; was an option.
	&lt;lb/&gt;It is also mentioned in /usr/src/sys/sys/TODO (that is, in the regular path), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;6. Exec fixes Implement dmr's #! feature; pass string arguments through faster.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism origins from Bell Labs, between Version 7 and Version 8,
	&lt;lb/&gt; and was then available on 4.0BSD (~10/'80), although not activated per default. &lt;lb/&gt; Two important differences to current implementations are: &lt;lb/&gt;The length of the line was limited to 16 (Research Unix) or 32 (BSD) bytes. &lt;lb/&gt;"Arguments" were not delivered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was then implemented by default on 4.2BSD (~09/'83), /usr/src/sys/sys/kern_exec.c by Robert Elz. &lt;lb/&gt; This implementation delivered all #! arguments as a single one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less than a year after 4.0BSD, but more than two years before 4.2 BSD, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was also added to
	2.8BSD (~07/'81), but not active by default.
	&lt;lb/&gt; 2.x BSD is a different development line, independent from 4 BSD. It's a 7th edition (V7) kernel with fixes activated by macros. &lt;lb/&gt; The macro for the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; code is not present in a makefile, so you had to activate it yourself.
	The code wording is slightly different from 4 BSD.
	&lt;lb/&gt; On 2.8 BSD, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; seems to come from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, not from Berkeley.

       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to Gunnar Ritter for pointing out the origins in 4.0 and 4.2BSD in de.comp.os.unix.shell, to Jeremy C. Reed for mentioning Robert Elz, and to Richard Kettlewell for spotting 2.8BSD on TUHS mailing list.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 4.3BSD Net/2 the code was removed due to the license war and had to be reimplemented for the descendants (e.g., NetBSD, 386BSD, BSDI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Version 8 (aka 8th edition), &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; is implemented in
	&lt;code&gt;/usr/sys/sys/sys1.c&lt;/code&gt;
	and documented in &lt;code&gt;exec(2)&lt;/code&gt;.

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the public releases from Bell Labs, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was not added until SVR4 ('88) according to a 
	TUHS list discussion.
	System III and SVR1 definitely had not implemented it, yet.

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dennis M. Ritchie (email answer to Alex North-Keys) he got the idea from elsewhere, perhaps from one of the UCB conferences on BSD. And it seems &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; had no name originally.

	&lt;lb/&gt;Doug McIllroy mentions in the TUHS mailing list, that the slang for &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; was "sharp" at the time at Bell Labs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paragraph "3.16) Why do some scripts start with #! ... ?" (local copy), &lt;lb/&gt; emphasizes the history concerning shells, not the kernel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That document is incorrect about two details (and it seems not to be actively maintained at the moment):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was not invented at Berkeley (but they implemented
	it first in widely distributed releases), see above.
	&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; csh-hack: the document explicitly states that only csh was modified
	on the BSDs.&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; required? 

	&lt;p&gt; There is a rumor, that a very few and very special, earlier Unix versions (particularly 4.2BSD derivatives) require you to separate the "&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;" from the following path with a blank.
        &lt;lb/&gt;You may also read, that (allegedly) such a kernel parses "&lt;code&gt;#! /&lt;/code&gt;" as a 32-bit (long) magic.

        But it turns out that it is virtually impossible to find
	a Unix which actually required this.

        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4.2BSD in fact doesn't require it, although previous versions of the GNU autoconf tutorial claimed this ("10. Portable Shell Programming", corrected with release 2.64, 2009-07-26). &lt;lb/&gt; But instead, see 4.2BSD, /usr/src/sys/sys/kern_exec.c (the first regular occurence). A blank is accepted but not required. &lt;lb/&gt;All this pointed out by Gunnar Ritter in &amp;lt;3B5B0BA4.XY112IX2@bigfoot.de&amp;gt; (and thanks to the new Caldera license, the code can be cited here now.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, the origin of this myth "of the required blank" might be a particular release of 4.1 BSD: There is a manpage in a "4.1.snap" snapshot of 4.1BSD &lt;lb/&gt;on the CSRG CDs, /usr/man/man2/exec.2 (4/1/81), where a space/tab after the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; is mentioned as mandatory.
	However, this is not true: the source itself remained unchanged.
        &lt;lb/&gt;(Hint to the existence of such a manpage from Bruce Barnett in &amp;lt;ae3m9l$rti$0@208.20.133.66&amp;gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear whether this is a bug or confusion in documentation or if Berkeley planned to modify the BSD source but eventually did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DYNIX is mentioned in the autoconf documentation, too. It's unclear if this variant might have implemented it in a few releases &lt;lb/&gt;(perhaps following the abovementioned manual page). At least Dynix 3.2.0 or Dynix PTS 1.2.0 were actually 4.2 BSD derived and did not require the blank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I asked David MacKenzie, the author of the autoconf documentation, about the actual origin of the autoconf note. &lt;lb/&gt; But unfortunately neither the reporting author nor the very system are recorded anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even intensive search of usenet archives didn't reveal any further hints to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found no evidence yet, that there's an implementation which forbids a blank after &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;

   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 4.4BSD, however, didn't support setuid scripts, yet. The UNIX FAQ claims this (4.7. "How can I get setuid shell scripts to work?"), &lt;lb/&gt;but it's explicitly denied in kern_exec.c. setuid for scripts had been disabled with 4.3BSD-Tahoe already. &lt;lb/&gt;And the successor to 4.4BSD, 4.4BSD-Lite lost its &lt;code&gt;execve()&lt;/code&gt;
	     implementation due to the license war.
	&lt;lb/&gt; Instead, a very early NetBSD release seems to be the origin concerning free BSDs 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[1]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; NetBSD already implements it in the first cvs entry for &lt;code&gt;exec_script.c&lt;/code&gt;
	    (1994/01/16), some time before release 1.0.
	    &lt;p&gt;Earlier code has been removed from netbsd.org. The filedescriptor filesystem ("fdescfs") had been added with release 0.8 (04/93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NetBSD was influenced by 386BSD, but I couldn't find it there (including patchkit 0.2.4, 06/93).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD, which is a direct descendant of 386BSD, doesn't implement it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenBSD forked off from NetBSD later (10/95) and thus implements it like NetBSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Steven aka Neozeed meanwhile provides NetBSD 0.8 and 0.9 via cvsweb (announcement) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set user id support is implemented by means of the fd filesystem for instance on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SETUIDSCRIPTS&lt;/code&gt; activated)
	&lt;code&gt;SETUIDSCRIPTS&lt;/code&gt; activated)
	&lt;code&gt;kern.sugid_scripts&lt;/code&gt;.
	&lt;p&gt;Set user id support is also implemented on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism),
	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; interpreter file is used.
	&lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt;.  Without this flag, the EUID is set back
		to the UID if different.
		&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism,
	     because you have to be aware of numerous issues.
	    &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; script 

    &lt;p&gt; or: can you nest &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;?

    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most probably there isn't any Bell-Labs- or Berkeley-derived Unix that accepts the interpreter to be a script, which starts with &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; again.

    &lt;lb/&gt;However, Linux since 2.6.27.9 2 and Minix accept this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to confuse whether the kernel accepts it, or if the kernel has returned with an &lt;code&gt;ENOEXEC&lt;/code&gt;
	&lt;lb/&gt;and your shell silently tries to take over, parsing the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; becomes the invoked script.)
    &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism was not present at compile time
	 (probably only in unix-like environments like cygwin).
    &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;, but only if "BSD" was not defined at compile time.
     Later variants de-facto do not recognize it.
    &lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[2]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; For more information about nested &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; on Linux, see the
	kernel patch [if link dead, then try this page, archive.org]
	&lt;p&gt;(patch to be applied to 2.6.27.9) and especially see binfmt_script.c which contains the important parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux allows at most&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BINPRM_MAX_RECURSION&lt;/code&gt;, that is 4, levels of nesting.
	&lt;p&gt;(hint to me about the change by Mantas Mikulėnas.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very few systems deliver only the first argument, some systems split up the arguments like a shell to fill up &lt;code&gt;argv[]&lt;/code&gt;,
	&lt;lb/&gt; most systems deliver all arguments as a single string. See the table below. I noticed that for Linux (delivering all arguments as one string), &lt;lb/&gt; a patch to split up was suggested on the Linux kernel mailing list (if link dead, then try this page, archive.org), followed by a discussion of some portability issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;env(1)&lt;/code&gt; is often used with the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; mechanism to start
	an interpreter, which then only needs to be somewhere
	in your PATH, e.g. "&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl&lt;/code&gt;".

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the location of &lt;code&gt;env(1)&lt;/code&gt; might vary.
	Free-, Net-, OpenBSD and some Linux distributions (e.g. Debian)
	only come with /usr/bin/env.
	&lt;lb/&gt;On the other hand, there's only /bin/env at least on SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 and Cray Unicos 9.0.2 (although the latter is only of historical interest). &lt;lb/&gt;On some other Linux distributions (Redhat) it's located in /bin and /usr/bin/ contains a symbolic link pointing to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The env-mechanism is highly increasing convenience, and almost all systems nowadays provide /usr/bin/env. Yet, it cannot strictly assure "portability" of a script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, env should not be a script. See "can you nest #!" above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD 4.0 introduced a comment-like handling of "#" in the arguments, &lt;lb/&gt;but release 6.0 revoked this (see also a discussion on freebsd-arch). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacOS X introduced comment-like handling of "#" with release 10.3(/xnu-517/Panther)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line: 
    &lt;code&gt;sizeof(struct a.out)&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;sizeof(struct exec)&lt;/code&gt;".
	&lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;, which contains both this struct
	a.out (or exec) and a string of the same size which will contain the &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line.
        &lt;code&gt;kern_execve.v&lt;/code&gt;
	(in the Attic), which
	inherited
	from 386BSD-0.1 patch 0.2.2, and soon
	added
	allowing one argument.
	&lt;code&gt;kern/exec_script.c&lt;/code&gt;
	(&lt;code&gt;MAXINTERP&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or
	&lt;code&gt;PATH_MAX&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/syslimits.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,
	respectively).

        &lt;code&gt;imgact_shell.c&lt;/code&gt;
	and 
        &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/imgact.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;machine/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
	(i386,
	ia64,
	sparc64,
	amd64,
	alpha:
	param.h and
	alpha_cpu.h,
	supported until 6.3) ,
	and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
	&lt;code&gt;MAXSHELLCMDLEN&lt;/code&gt; now is set to &lt;code&gt;PAGESIZE&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn depends on the architecture.

        &lt;code&gt;kern/exec_script.c&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;MAXINTERP&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

	&lt;code&gt;BINPRM_BUF_SIZE&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;load_script()&lt;/code&gt; in
	&lt;code&gt;linux/fs/binfmt_script.c&lt;/code&gt;,
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;linux/binfmts.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and
	&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;uapi/linux/binfmts.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
	


	&lt;p&gt; On Linux, &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was introduced with kernel release 0.09 or 0.10
	(0.08 had not implemented it, yet).
	&lt;lb/&gt;And in fact, the original maximum length was 1022, see &lt;code&gt;linux/fs/exec.c&lt;/code&gt; from Linux 0.10.
	&lt;lb/&gt;But with Linux 0.12, this was changed to 127 (parts of a diff). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;limits.h&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;syslimits.h&lt;/code&gt;
	on the respective system.

	&lt;p&gt;Exceptions are BIG-IP4.2 (BSD/OS4.1) with 4096 and FreeBSD since 6.0 (PAGE_SIZE) with 4096 or 8192 depending on the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minix also uses the limit of &lt;code&gt;PATH_MAX&lt;/code&gt; characters
	(255 here) but the actual limit is 257 characters,
	&lt;lb/&gt;because &lt;code&gt;patch_stack()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;src/mm/exec.c&lt;/code&gt;
	first skips the "&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;" with an &lt;code&gt;lseek()&lt;/code&gt; and then reads in the rest.

	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; magic with a multi character constant
	&lt;code&gt;	 #define SCRMAG '#!'&lt;/code&gt;

	&lt;code&gt;SCRMAG&lt;/code&gt;,
	and even added its own multi character constant for a variant of the magic:
	&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;# define SCRMAG2 '/*#!'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;# define ARGPLACE "$*"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find more information about this in the end notes [Demos].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sys/i386/i386/exec_machdep.c&lt;/code&gt;) shows an interesting way to construct the magic
	&lt;quote&gt;[...] switch (magic) { /* interpreters (note byte order dependency) */ case '#' | '!' &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8: handler = exec_interpreter; break; case [...]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; only as a possible extension:

    &lt;quote&gt;Shell Introduction [...] If the first line of a file of shell commands starts with the characters #!, the results are unspecified. The construct #! is reserved for implementations wishing to provide that extension. A portable application cannot use #! as the first line of a shell script; it might not be interpreted as a comment. [...] Command Search and Execution [...] This description requires that the shell can execute shell scripts directly, even if the underlying system does not support the common #! interpreter convention. That is, if file foo contains shell commands and is executable, the following will execute foo: ./foo&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a Working Group Resolution trying to define the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, speaking about "&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;" on any Unix:
    &lt;lb/&gt; This is a really rocksolid and portable convention by tradition, if you expect anything from the Bourne shell family and its descendants to be called. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was a great hack to make scripts look and feel like real executable binaries.
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, as a little summary, what's special about &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt;? (list mostly courtesy of David Korn)
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; is much smaller than the maximum path length
	&lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; is not searched for the interpreter
 	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line also accepts a relative path,
	&lt;code&gt;#!interpreter&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;#!./interpreter&lt;/code&gt;,
	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; script again
	&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line itself is varying
	&lt;code&gt;#!$SHELL&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;.
	&lt;p&gt;This error can be misleading, because many shells then print the script name instead of the interpreter in its &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line:
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$cat script.sh #!/bin/notexistent $ ./script.sh ./script.sh: not foundbash since release 3 subsequently itself reads the first line and gives a diagnostic concerning the interpreter&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;bash: ./script.sh: /bin/notexistent: bad interpreter: No such file or directory&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; line is too long, at least three things can happen:
	&lt;code&gt;E2BIG&lt;/code&gt;
	    (IRIX, SCO OpenServer)
	    or &lt;code&gt;ENAMETOOLONG&lt;/code&gt;
	    (FreeBSD, BIG-IP4.2, BSD/OS4.1)
	    &lt;code&gt;ENOEXEC&lt;/code&gt;.
		In some shells this results in a silent failure.
		&lt;p&gt;I used the following as program "showargs":&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; int main(argc, argv) int argc; char** argv; { int i; for (i=0; i&amp;lt;argc; i++) fprintf(stdout, "argv[%d]: \"%s\"\n", i, argv[i]); return(0); }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;and a one line script named "invoker.sh" to call it, similar to this,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#!/tmp/showargs -1 -2 -3&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;to produce the following results (tried them myself, but I'd like to add your results from yet different systems).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, a result from the above would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;argv[0]: "/tmp/showargs" argv[1]: "-1 -2 -3" argv[2]: "./invoker.sh"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... but the following table lists the variations. The meaning of the columns is explained below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="12"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;OS (arch)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; maximum&lt;p&gt;length of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#! line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; cut-off (cut), &lt;p&gt;error (error) or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENOEXEC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; all args in one, &lt;p&gt;no

a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;comment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; argv[0]:&lt;p&gt;invoker,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;instead of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;interpreter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; not

&lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; contains
     the basename of the called program instead of its full path.

&lt;code&gt;n/a&lt;/code&gt;" means that the attribute is not relevant in this case.

&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[orig]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; 4.0BSD and 386BSD-0.1 don't hand over any argument at all. &lt;p&gt;The called interpreter only receives argv[0] with it's own path, argv[1] with the script, and optionally further arguments from the call of the script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[43bsd]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; The code in kern_exec.c tests if the byte after the struct containing the #! line is null. Otherwise it throws an ENOEXEC. &lt;p&gt;However, reading the line from the file is also limited to 32 bytes, and the following byte (not from the file)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;is often zeroed out by coincidence. It then looks as if the line was cut to 32 bytes. But sometimes, you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;actually get an ENOEXEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[netbsd0.9]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; If the line is longer than 32 bytes, it triggers a bug: the scriptname is appended to argv[1] and argv[2] contains an environment variable. &lt;p&gt;setuid support is a compile time option, however not per Makefile but by activating it in kern_exec.c itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[big-ip]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; This BIG-IP 4.2 (vendor is F5) is based on BSDi BSD/OS 4.1, probably even with very few modifications: &lt;p&gt;The tools contain the string "BSD/OS 4.1" and there's also a kernel /bsd-generic, which contains "BSDi BSD/OS 4.1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had no compiler available on this system, thus some tests are pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[sco]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; John H. DuBois told me that &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; was introduced in SCO UNIX 3.2v4.0, but was disabled by default.
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to use it, it had to be enabled by setting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hashplingenable&lt;/code&gt;
in kernel/space.c ("hashpling" because 
&lt;p&gt;it was implemented by programmers in Britain). It was apparently enabled by default in 3.2v4.2, but even then there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;were no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; scripts shipped with the OS as a customer might disable it.
The first &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; scripts (tcl) were shipped in 3.2v5.0 then.

&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[early-linux]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; On linux 0.10 until 0.99.1, &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; contains both the interpreter and the arguments:
     &lt;code&gt;argv[0]: "/tmp/showargs -1 -2 -3"&lt;/code&gt;


&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[hurd]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; Nesting interpreters this way: &lt;quote&gt;$ ./script2 -2 script2: #!/path/script1 -1 script1: #!/path/showargs -0results in&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;argv[0]: "/path/showargs" argv[1]: "-0" argv[2]: "/path/script1" argv[3]: "-1" argv[4]: "./script2" argv[5]: "-2"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[uwin]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; An example for a valid absolute interpreter path is &lt;code&gt;C:/path/to/interpreter&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A path with backslashes or without the drive letter is not accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home of the UWIN package at AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[cygwin]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; Valid absolute interpreter paths are for example &lt;code&gt;C:/path/to/interpreter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/path/to/interpreter&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backslashes are not accepted. Nested script are only possible if a drive letter is used&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; becomes a path in windows notation &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\interpreter&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt; nested &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; cygwin.com: Web-Git (formerly Web-CVS) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On cygwin-1.7.55 the call even can succeed with values greater than 65536, but only occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;[Demos]&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt; DEMOS / ДЕМОС was a Soviet variant of 2.9BSD (PDP-11 version), or 4.2 BSD (32bit VAX-version), respectively. &lt;p&gt;See also the Wikipedia entry and gunkies.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demos recognizes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#!CMD A1 $* A2 A3&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demos also knows an alternative magic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;/*#!for interpreters which use&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; as comment instead of &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Random821 for pointing out this special implementation on the THUS list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;And why shebang? In music, '#' means sharp. So just shorten &lt;code&gt;#!&lt;/code&gt; to sharp-bang.  Or it might be derived from "shell
bang".  All this probably under the influence of the american slang
idiom "the whole shebang" (everything, the works, everything
involved in what is under consideration).  

See also the 
wiktionary,
jargon
dictionary
or Merriam-Websters.

Sometimes it's also called hash-bang, pound-bang,
sha-bang/shabang, hash-exclam, or hash-pling
(british, isn't it?).

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dennis M. Ritchie (email answer to Alex North-Keys) it seems it had no name originally. &lt;lb/&gt;And Doug McIllroy mentioned in the TUHS mailing list, that the slang for &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; at Bell Labs most probably was "sharp" at the time.

    &lt;p&gt;Textile made of natural stone? Yes, it is possible!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Laptop Displays&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page provides details on the various laptop display technologies used with DOS laptop, portable and luggable computers. It should be read in conjunction with the Graphics Cards page as well as my CRT Monitors page for completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days we take it for granted that our modern laptops have colour high-resolution screens. Back when manufacturers were trying to make the IBM PC or compatible more transportable and lightweight, installing a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) miniature monitor into a case made it preventatively heavy. CRTs were relatively cheap despite their weight, so it was an obvious choice to use tiny CRTs in their luggable machines. The first portable PCs - the Compaq Portable range - also used a CRT and IBM themselves used one in their first potable, the IBM Portable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After only a handful of these heavyweights, the PC market turned to Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology, and whilst it was hugely expensive to make large LCD screens, as popularity of mobile computing grew prices fell, and so the use of LCDs more or less stuck throughout the DOS era in one guise or another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LCD technology was another that first arose in the 1960s. It was tremendously energy-efficient, and required very little space so it suited mobile devices well. Since LCDs don't produce any light themselves (unlike gas plasma), they really needed what was to be called a backlight (literally, a light shining from the back of the screen) to really make the screen more readable. Backlit LCD displays really didn't start to appear until 1988 - before then your laptop computer's LCD display was like a large calculator screen using nothing more than a reflective layer behind the liquid crystals to reflect ambient light! There was also the concept of 'sidelit' displays where rather than shining a light from behind the screen, the display would have a light on each side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even with a backlight, LCD displays have poor contrast and a slow refresh rate, which would produce a "ghosting" effect whenever the displayed content was scrolling or moving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Toshiba T1100 with its monochrome LCD display (1985)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gas Plasma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gas plasma displays were first used in the 1960s. In a gas plasma display, each pixel is illuminated by a tiny bit of plasma (charged gas). Gas plasma displays are thinner than CRTs due to there being no need for an electron gun at a certain distance from the back of the screen, and are much brighter than LCD displays. The gases used in a gas plasma display are neon and xenon, both inert, and these are sandwiched in between two plates that have been coated in a conductive print - one of which contains vertical lines, and the other, horizontal lines. So together they form a grid. When electric current is passed through the conductive prints on these two plates the gas at the point they meet glows, which is seen by the user as a single pixel lighting up. Despite being particularly bright and produce a nice sharp image, gas plasma displays use a lot of power, making them pretty unsuitable for portable computing, but it made a comeback with flat-panel TVs many years later!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The orange gas plasma display from a Toshiba T3200SX (1989)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Supertwist Nematic (STN) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invented in 1983, the STN is a type of monochrome passive-matrix LCD display. The "passive" in the wording here means that each pixel must maintain its state (off or on) without active driving circuitry until it can be refreshed again. In a Twisted Nematic (TN) display the liquid crystal molecules have an electric field applied to them to realign the molecules to either be off (twisted 90 degrees, electric field off), or on (untwisted, electric field on). Sadly due to limitations/thresholds of passive-matrix addressing, TN displays could only be so large. In a supertwist nematic display, the molecules are twisted 180 to 270 degrees which allowed for more rows and columns, hence higher resolution displays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All STN displays were monochrome until NEC launched the first colour laptop, the ProSpeed CSX, in October 1989. Several other laptop manufacturers had been working on colour screen technology at the same time, so 1990 saw many more colour laptops arrive on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One advantage of STN displays is that they require no backlight - they are still readable under direct sunlight with a reflective layer behind the display. Unfortunately, because they are still passive matrix, the ghosting effect seen with LCD monochrome displays is still present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Compaq LTE Elite 4/40C with a colour STN display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Double Layer Supertwist Nematic (DSTN) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To overcome the slow refresh rate of STN screens, DSTN technology splits the screen into two halves, where each half is simultaneously refreshed, giving a much faster overall refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, DSTN still suffers from the same inherent problems of any passive-matrix display, like low contrast (typically a DSTN display has a contrast ratio of 15:1 compared to TFT displays which are 40:1 or better), and washed-out colours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The Toshiba Satellite Pro 400CDS with its colour DSTN display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Thin Film Transistor (TFT) Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT, also called "active-matrix" displays arrived around mid-1992, and were available in both monochrome and colour, though most laptop manufacturers had stopped selling monochrome TFT laptops by 1994 as prices of the colour displays dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT displays work on the basis of each individual pixel being switched on or off by up to four transistors. The "active" in the name is because each pixel also has a capacitor that actively maintains the pixel state. Whilst much more expensive than STN/DSTN displays, they overcome all the problems of a passive-matrix display. They have a much higher contrast ratio and a fast refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; A Compaq LTE 5200 from 1996 with its colour TFT display&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early TFT displays had a maximum display resolution of 640 x 480 - if you wanted to run Windows in a higher resolution you could do so by attaching an external monitor to the laptop. By 1996 the SVGA resolution of 800 x 600 was becoming more commonplace for TFT laptops, and top-end ones even supported 1,024 x 768.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TFT technology is still widely used on modern-day laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;40 years ago, Calvin and Hobbes' raucous adventures burst onto the comics page&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;40 years ago — on November 18, 1985 — a new comic strip appeared in the newspaper: Calvin and Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hobbes was a stuffed tiger, but in the mind of 6-year-old Calvin he was a wryly observant companion for his day-to-day challenges and wildly imaginative adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adventures of the beloved duo lasted just a decade. Their creator — cartoonist Bill Watterson — walked away from Calvin and Hobbes at the height of its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watterson — who has given few interviews — seamlessly combined the silly, the fantastic and the profound in his strip. That slightly demented quality captured editor Lee Salem, who spoke with NPR's Renee Montagne in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem: I remember it when I first read it, and it all... it literally took my breath away. And I circulated it in the office, and the response was immediate. It was fresh, it was funny, the art was strong, and here's this archetypal little boy living a life that some of us lived or wanted to live or remembered living. ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the single favorites that I have is actually on my wall in the office, and it shows Calvin in bed, obviously with a fever or something. He's got a thermometer in his mouth. You hear the words from a television. He's watching a soap opera — you know, "If you leave your spouse and I'll leave mine and we can get married." And it goes on and on and on, as lurid soap operas sometimes do. And Calvin turns to the reader with a big grin on his face, and he says, "Sometimes, I learn more when I stay home from school than when I go." And I just thought that was so funny. And, amazingly, when it ran, we actually got complaints from readers who said, "Well, you know, you're advocating that children stay home and watch adult soap operas." And somehow, the whole sense of irony was lost in that, but I don't think it was lost on me. I love that strip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renee Montagne: You know, I describe him as a little boy with his tiger friend, but there's so much more to it than that. So there's one where they're sitting philosophizing, as they often do, on the grass, this time under a tree. Hobbes is looking at the sky and saying, "Do you think there's a god?" And they're both gazing and thinking, and then in the fourth panel, Calvin thinks about it. And then do you remember what he says?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: Yeah. "Yeah, well, someone is out to get me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Calvin was preceded into existence by some pretty famous little boys: Charlie Brown, Dennis the Menace. What made him different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: You know, we saw Calvin living in a world he never made, populated by adults and teachers, and he was trying to deal with that and accomplish what he could. I think Calvin has a bit more perhaps Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in him than Charlie Brown. Hobbes I see almost as the alter ego of Calvin. He's a balancing act that allows Calvin to exist. He provides commentary on some of Calvin's crazy adventures and attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagne: Hobbes goes from being a stuffed tiger when there's any other person in the room, to the real Hobbes we know and love. Is Hobbes real or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem: He is to me, and obviously he is to Calvin. Whether he is to the other characters or not is an open question. But I think one of the things Bill brought to the art board was this wonderful ability to take a child's imagination and fantasy life and make it real. It really is irrelevant whether Hobbes has an existence as we would define it. For Calvin, he is there. He's a buddy, he's a companion, he's a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Salem edited Calvin and Hobbes until the comic strip ended in 1995. Creator Bill Watterson said at the time that he wanted to explore a canvas beyond the four panels of a daily newspaper, and to work at what he called "a more thoughtful pace," but has produced little public work since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salem died in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;THE HONOURABLE MRS JUSTICE COLLINS RICE&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mrs Justice Collins Rice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a dispute between prominent ‘free software movement’ activists. The free software movement advances a philosophy and practice which values the freedom of users to create and share software enabling internet access, and challenges the dominance of ‘big tech’ software and systems over the online experience. That includes a preference for internet relay chat (‘IRC’), an online instant messaging system dating in origin from the 1990s, over the big social media platforms. The challenge the free software movement makes is not only of a technical, but also of a social, economic or ethical nature, and it espouses some wider sets of values accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claimant, Dr Matthew Garrett, describes himself as a software engineer, computer security expert, and free software activist, with an academic background in (computational) genetics. He gained his doctorate at Cambridge University, and has worked with ARM Ltd, a Cambridge-based software design company, throughout his career. He is currently based in ‘Silicon Valley’ in California, where he holds a senior position at NVIDIA, one of the top half dozen big tech companies globally, and a part-time lectureship at the University of California, Berkeley, teaching operating systems security for a masters course. He sets out that he has worked on some of the most significant projects in the free software movement and won a Free Software Foundation award in 2013 for his work on Secure Boot, UEFI and the Linux kernel (at the time, he states, the FSF was one of the most important organisations in the world for the advancement of free software).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defendants are a Manchester-based married couple, each of whom operates a UK website focusing on free software information, interests and campaigns, and hosting an IRC channel. Dr Roy Schestowitz describes himself as a software engineer, interdisciplinary researcher and fair competition advocate, with an academic background in medical biophysics. He operates the website www.techrights.org (‘Techrights’). Mrs Rianne Schestowitz describes herself as a computer scientist who works for a FOSS (free and open-source software) specialist. She operates the website news.tuxmachines.org (‘Tuxmachines’). Both websites have been in operation for some two decades. These websites are declared by Dr Schestowitz to be not-for-profit undertakings – they are, he says, a committed labour of love on which they both publish tirelessly to the extent of thousands of articles a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett brings a claim in libel over a series of 24 publications appearing on either Techrights or Tuxmachines or both, in August and September 2023. The publications complained of appear at Annex A to this judgment. Dr Garrett brings a further claim in data protection in respect of these and a number of other publications appearing on the websites at around the same time. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz counterclaim in harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litigation History&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett issued proceedings, and filed and served his particulars of claim, in April 2024. This had been preceded, as is usual, by a certain amount of correspondence before action, in which Dr Garrett had requested the removal of the publications from the websites. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz declined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz filed and served a defence and counterclaim in September 2024. The libel claim was resisted on the grounds that (a) none of the publications complained of had caused or was likely to cause serious harm to Dr Garrett’s reputation, and (b) one or more of the statutory defences of truth, honest opinion and publication on a matter of public interest applied. The data protection claim was resisted on the ground that the journalistic purposes exemption applied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz’s pleadings had been professionally prepared, but they have been acting in person in recent months, including representing themselves at trial. There was a significant amount of interlocutory case management activity, overseen by the Masters, in August and September of 2025, notably in relation to timetabling the provision of witness statements by or on behalf of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz. These had still not been forthcoming by the time of the pre-trial review before Griffiths J on 6th October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz did not attend the PTR. Griffiths J proceeded in their absence. His order confirmed, among other things, that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;1.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By the operation of CPR 32.10, because the Defendants have not served any witness statement or witness summary for use at trial by 29 August 2025, as required by the CCMC Order of Master Davison dated 15 January 2025 and the extension of time granted by the Order of Master Dagnall dated 27 August 2025, neither Defendant is permitted to call any witness to give oral evidence at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;2.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Any application for relief from sanctions will be considered in accordance with CPR 3.8 and CPR 3.9 in the event that such an application is made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There appears to be no record that any formal application was subsequently made, although I was shown an unsealed version of an application by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz to set aside the order of Griffiths J. Dr Schestowitz confirmed to me at the opening of the trial on 30th October 2025, at which he and Mrs Schestowitz were informally supported by a defamation solicitor, that in any event no further order was sought on that (unsealed) application and no further application was being made. He told me that he and Mrs Schestowitz had taken a deliberate decision not to submit any evidence or call any witnesses, on financial grounds. He confirmed that he understood that meant that, while he and Mrs Schestowitz would be able to put Dr Garrett to proof of his claims, to cross-examine the claimant witnesses (Dr Garrett and his solicitor), and to make submissions to me, they would not be able by these means to introduce evidence in support of their defence and counterclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defamation ‘Preliminary Issues’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There had been no ‘preliminary issues’ determination ahead of trial in this case. Mr Hamer, Counsel for Dr Garrett, explained that the parties’ pleadings had not been very far apart in this respect. Nevertheless, there was no formal agreement about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single natural and ordinary meaning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My preliminary task was therefore to “determine the single natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, which is the meaning that the hypothetical reasonable reader would understand the words to bear”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal principles I am required to apply in doing so are well established. I directed myself to the useful guidance on determination of ‘single natural and ordinary meaning’ distilled from the authorities (including that of the Supreme Court in Stocker v Stocker [2020] AC 593) and set out in Koutsogiannis v Random House Group[2020] 4 WLR 25,at [11] and [12]. The guidance of the authorities is of course just that – guidance – intended to simplify not complicate the exercise. And each case turns on its own facts. But the following briefly summarises the guidance as it applies to the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governing principle in determining ‘meaning’ is reasonableness. The intention of the publisher (here, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz respectively) is irrelevant in law: the test focuses on how words are read, not how or why they came to be written. It is an objective, not subjective, test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each publication must be considered as a whole, in the context in which an ordinary reasonable reader would have read it. That reference to ‘context’ was explained by Nicklin J in Riley v Murray [2020] EMLR 20 at [15]-[17]. I can, and where relevant should, take account of: (a) matters of common knowledge – facts so well known that, for practical purposes, everybody knows them; (b) matters to be treated as intrinsic to the publication – for example via a hyperlink; and (c) any other material that could reasonably be expected to have been known or read by all the readers of the publication complained of. But otherwise, no evidence beyond the publication complained of is admissible as to what it means. And natural and ordinary meaning does not rely on a reader having any special knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am guided away from over-elaborate or lawyerly analysis of text. I need to avoid both literalism, and any strained or forced interpretation. I can and must determine the single meaning I myself consider correct, and am not bound by the meanings advanced by the parties (so long as I do not alight on something more injurious than a claimant's pleaded meaning).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I am to keep in mind, as guided, the perspective of an ordinary, reasonable reader of each article complained of, reading it once through as it appears, and forming an impression of what it conveys on its face. The reasonable reader is neither naïve nor suspicious; is able to read between the lines and pick up an implication; and is allowed a certain amount of loose thinking without being ‘avid for scandal’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact/opinion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have further directed myself to Koutsogiannis at [16] and [17], as well as to Millett v Corbyn [2021] EWCA Civ 567, for guidance on considering whether the words complained of contain allegations of fact or expressions of opinion. I am reminded by the authorities that the test for the difference between fact and opinion is an objective one. That comes back to how the words would strike the ordinary reasonable reader. I have to look at the substance, not the intention of the writer or any label the writer may, or may not, have attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subject matter and immediate context can be especially important here. In the classic formulation, “opinion is something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark or observation” (Clarke v Norton [1910] VLR 494 at page 499). But sometimes care is needed: there is a difference between comment which is pure opinion and comment which is an imputation of underlying fact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Factual allegations can be published with varying degrees of certainty as to what is being imputed. These degrees of certainty have been classically analysed at three distinct levels : level 1: the claimant is 'guilty' of the conduct alleged; level 2: there is 'reason to suspect' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged; and level 3: there are 'grounds for investigating whether' the claimant is guilty of the conduct alleged (Chase v. News Group Newspapers[2002] EWCA Civ 172).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ are distinct preliminary issues, the authorities counsel against trying to resolve them in too linear or compartmentalised a fashion. I have to bear in mind whether this is a case in which the questions of ‘meaning’ and ‘fact/opinion’ might throw light on each other, such that it would be wrong to tackle them in a sequence which proves to be a trap of false logic. I note the risk and seek to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defamatory Tendency&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test at common law for whether a (natural and ordinary) meaning is defamatory is well-established: whether it substantially affects in an adverse manner the attitude of other people towards a claimant, or has a tendency to do so. Some recent authorities put it in terms of identifying that a claimant has breached the common, shared values of our society (Millett v Corbyn). This is not about actual impact at this stage, it is about the meaning of the words themselves and their inherent tendency to damage someone’s reputation. ‘Substantially’ imports a threshold of gravity or seriousness (Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2010] EWHC 1414).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach, Consideration and Determinations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I adopted the standard approach to the determination of meaning and the other preliminary issues. I read each article complained of quickly once through, before knowing what either party wanted to say about it. I formed and noted my initial impressions. I then read the parties’ pleadings and skeleton arguments or position statements, heard oral submissions (neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz chose to address me orally on the preliminary issues), and reserved judgment as to how far to adjust my initial views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table attached to this judgment at Annex B sets out the parties’ rival meanings and, in the final column, the matters I have now determined. Where relevant, I have included some short explanatory notes for my decisions where there appeared to be any significant dispute about a particular issue. The following general points also arise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I have had to reflect in a number of respects on whether my preliminary views on meaning needed to be moderated on the ground that they went further than those contended for by the Claimant. Where I have concluded that my meaning was simply a particularisation of matters expressed in more general terms by the Claimant, I have not done so. Where, however, I had identified a meaning not referred to in the Claimant’s pleading, I have withdrawn it for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, while each publication’s meaning is determined on its own terms, some common repetitive themes emerge. Dr Garrett is chiefly accused of an online campaign of material which is (variously) criminal, illegal or offensive. The criminal matters alleged include cybercrime, hate crime, blackmail, issuing threats of violence or death, and matters adjacent to terrorism. Other illegal matters alleged include defamation, harassment and online abuse. Offensive matters alleged include material that is variously racist, antisemitic, misogynist, homophobic or otherwise hateful or discriminatory, sexually incontinent, or drugs-related. Dr Garrett is alleged to have waged this campaign through the medium of IRC ‘sockpuppet’ accounts – accounts under pseudonymous user nicknames intended to be a vehicle for distributing material anonymously and deniably. Many posts from these accounts are reproduced in the articles complained of. Dr Garrett is also repeatedly alleged to be an uncontrolled user of illegal class A drugs, principally crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, I have concurred with the parties in understanding that most of the allegations relate to online behaviour. But there are some notable exceptions to that, chief of which is the allegation relating to Dr Garrett’s being an habitual cocaine user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, where criminal or illegal acts are alleged, the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Claimant – namely that these are allegations of fact at Chase level 1. An ordinary reasonable reader would, in my view, have no difficulty in understanding that Dr Garrett is straightforwardly being said to have committed them. Where, however, offensive attitudinal matters are alleged – racism, misogyny, etc – the meanings I have determined are closer to those contended for by the Defendants – namely that these are evaluative expressions of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although it is not formally admitted, there can be no doubt at all that each of the publications is of grossly ‘defamatory tendency’ at common law. They allege multiple and serious transgressions of society’s norms, up to and including the criminal law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Serious Harm’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By section 1(1) of the Defamation Act 2013, ‘A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leading authority on this provision is the decision of the Supreme Court in Lachaux v Independent Print Ltd [2020] AC 612. As Lord Sumption’s judgment makes clear ([12]-[14]), section 1(1) imposed a new threshold test for defamation claims, the application of which is to be determined by reference to the actual facts about the impact of a publication, and not just to the meaning of the words. It requires real-world effects to be established beyond the inherent ‘defamatory tendency’ of any publication. The statutory term ‘has caused’ points to some historic reputational harm, which can be shown actually to have occurred; and ‘is likely to cause’ points to probable, actual, future reputational harm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The serious harm test is a question of fact, and facts must be established by evidence. Facts and evidence – and causation – are matters which are entirely case-specific. But a claimant’s statutory task of establishing that publishees changed their minds for the worse about them – and to a degree warranting the description of ‘serious reputational harm’ – because of reading something, poses clear evidential challenges. That is partly because of the nature of the harm in question: the ‘harm’ of defamation is the effect of a publication in the mind of a third-party publishee (reader), and not any action they may take as a result (nor is it the direct effect of a publication on a claimant reading it themselves). And it is partly because of simple practical considerations: particularly in cases of mass publication, the minds of the publishees may be effectively evidentially unreachable. In such cases, finding enough readers willing to testify that they thought the worse of a claimant has long been recognised as a prohibitively impractical undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorities have therefore developed some detailed guidelines for trial courts applying the serious harm test in ‘mass publication’ cases. In such cases, Lachaux confirmed (at [21]) that a claimant may be able to discharge their evidential burden of establishing serious reputational harm by inference drawn from a factual matrix combining the meaning of the words, the situation of the claimant, the circumstances of the publication(s) complained of and the inherent circumstantial probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That matrix, in turn, has to be established as a matter of fact and evidence. But again, the authorities give some assistance. The well-established ‘grapevine’ or ‘percolation’ tendencies (Slipper v BBC[1991] 1 QB 283; Cairns v Modi[2013] 1 WLR 1015) of defamatory publications, particularly online and through social media of any kind, may in an appropriate case be factored into inference about scale of publication. And the likely identity, as well as the numbers, of at least some of a class of publishees may be relevant to the assessment of harm, for example where some individuals may be particularly positioned to lose confidence in a claimant or take adverse action as a result. But these are highly fact-specific matters; the inferences which may properly be drawn in any individual case depend entirely on the circumstances of that case. The Court of Appeal in Blake v Fox[2025] EWCA Civ 1321 has, however, recently indicated that if a claimant establishes a factual matrix of mass publication, grave defamatory tendency of the content, and the claimant’s significant reputational exposure, then the inference of serious reputational harm may have to be considered by a court to be irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consideration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approach, and Gravity of Imputation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett advances a wholly inferential case of serious harm, relying on this being a case of mass publication, very grave inherent defamatory content, the engagement of his own professional and reputational capital, and inherent probabilities. The burden lies on him to establish this underpinning factual matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a starting point, I have no difficulty in the first place in recognising the heavy gravity of the allegations made in each and every publication complained of. Dr Garrett’s responsibility for a relentless online campaign of harassment and abuse, by the covert means of sockpuppet accounts, is advanced as fact. Extensive, multiple and serious online criminality is advanced as fact. Dr Garrett is accused of publishing a range of toxic or highly offensive online material by reference to direct quotations from the sockpuppet accounts he is accused of authoring; this material is on its face grossly offensive in many dimensions and carries clear implications of the social and moral turpitude of its author. Habitual illegal class A drug use is advanced as fact. In the meanings I have determined – and as to which the parties’ pleaded cases were not in the end separated by a wide margin, since they largely spoke for themselves – the publications complained of are undoubtedly very grave indeed. I did not hear that seriously disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz however make a double challenge to Dr Garrett’s task of establishing a factual matrix to support an inference of serious harm. They put him to proof (a) that this is in fact a mass publication case, and (b) that his reputation is materially engaged – in each case, within the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Situation of the Claimant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking the latter first, the ‘situation of the claimant’ in this case is that Dr Garrett was born in Ireland and moved to England with his family as a very young child. He emigrated to California in 2009 and has not lived in the UK for 16 years. He holds UK, Irish and US citizenship. To succeed on his claim as brought, he has to demonstrate serious reputational harm within the court’s jurisdiction – that is, in England and Wales. His evidence about his reputation here is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett states that his reputation in England is both established, and ‘immensely important’ to him. Before 2009 he had worked for the University of Cambridge and had done other Cambridge-based work, starting by doing contract work and working for a tech start-up, before going on to work for Collabora (described as a private open-source software consulting company headquartered in Cambridge) and for Red Hat, a US company with a wholly-owned British subsidiary which had been his employer here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He draws attention to his current senior role with NVIDIA, which ‘does significant business in Britain’. In that role he has undertaken collaborative work with British companies including Collabora, Linaro, ARM and other consulting firms, including while present in the jurisdiction. He describes these ‘ongoing collaborations’ as being ‘extremely important in terms of providing value to my employer since then’. His evidence is that ‘the reason I am valuable to my employer and my previous employers, is that I am exceedingly good at working across a range of different technologies and with a range of different companies. If my ability to work with any of the companies who are working in a specific field is impaired, the value proposition of me for my employer goes down’. He states that damage to his reputation in England ‘would have an impact on NVIDIA’s willingness to continue employing me’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett draws attention to the fact that he holds a teaching position at a US university with an international reputation in his field, including in this country, and was awarded a ‘distinguished faculty award’ by that university. His evidence is that his past and present academic reputation is engaged in England. Of his future plans, he states that ‘my goal in the end, at the point where I am in a position to retire, is to be able to move back to the United Kingdom and potentially adopt a position at a university here’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he is regularly invited to speak at major events (with thousands of attendees) concerned with free software, Linux or cybersecurity generally, and has done so in the UK on half a dozen occasions in recent years. He has also spoken at major European events with significant attendance from UK participants, including in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett also gives evidence that he has many friends and colleagues in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did not hear this evidence materially challenged in substance. Dr Garrett’s evidence on the nature, extent and value of his reputation in England and Wales was clear and straightforward. I can and do accept it. It enables me to find as a fact that his professional, employment, academic and personal reputation is materially engaged within the jurisdiction. I make that finding accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extent of Publication&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principal dispute in this case on the question of serious reputational harm is, however, that of extent of publication (within the jurisdiction) of the articles complained of. Mr Hamer contended for an inference of a readership in the tens of thousands, within the jurisdiction, for each article complained of, to date. The evidence of this before me was limited. I do not of course have any evidence from Dr and Mrs Schestowitz, and the pre-trial disclosure exercise revealed no analytics for readership of the articles in question (the defence states that ‘site analysis data is wiped after short periods of retention’).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not in dispute that the websites get something like a million hits a day. A hit is not an indication of readership; a single page may require a number of ‘hits’ to be viewed. Dr Schestowitz made a challenge that something like half of those could be immediately discounted as machine-generated (bots, crawlers and so on). He made a challenge to the remaining figure based on the proportion of the anglophone world attributable to the UK being a percentage in the low single figures. He made a further challenge based on the high rate with which new articles are posted on both websites, and the relative age (and therefore incremental occlusion) of the material complained of. He challenged that there was no evidential basis in the ‘million a day’ figure for a readership above tens in the UK on any one day, and that many of them would likely be repeat viewers, reading the same articles again and again. Dr Schestowitz pointed out that neither he nor Mrs Schestowitz publishes on, or is a user of, mass social media platforms, that their websites attract viewers with similar preferences against modern social media, and that the grapevine or percolation effects often deployed in defamation litigation to encourage inference of mass publication are accordingly of limited application here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, and having been put to proof of extent of publication, Dr Garrett’s case that this is an instance of mass publication was advanced evidentially by him, and in argument by Mr Hamer, along the following lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, all of the articles complained of remain online, and have done so since their original publication more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a number of the articles appear reduplicated on both websites, and a number cross refer to each other via embedded hyperlinks. The final publication (the Wiki page) is a compendious hyperlink library of nearly all the articles complained of. The articles, in other words, contain within themselves mechanisms of accessibility and republication, and hence maximise readership potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, and bearing in mind the extent of his reputational engagement in the UK, recent Google searches on Dr Garrett’s name from a UK location were bringing up links to Techrights and Tuxmachines articles complained of (including the final Wiki page publication) on the first page, and, it appears, also did so around the time of the original publication (as one of the Tuxmachines posts seems to have acknowledged). That suggests both (a) the continuing ready accessibility of the material complained of to those interested in Dr Garrett and (b) the historical popularity of actual access to the Schestowitz websites via Google. Google is of course only one among a number of popular search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, both websites are well-established. It is conspicuous that each has been active over two decades; that is a significant marker in the field. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that they are serious, sought-after, well-regarded, popular and trusted in the anglophone free software community, including for news, campaigning and educational content. Neither Dr nor Mrs Schestowitz suggested otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece in the jigsaw Mr Hamer sought to assemble is a centuries-old English legal principle, derived from the case of Armory v Delamirie(1721) 93 ER 664, that, to the extent that there are gaps in trial evidence, a party who is responsible for them is not entitled to benefit from them. The principle in Armory has been recognised in the caselaw as having a potential to apply in defamation actions to assist a claimant in discharging their burden of proof, where a defendant has failed to provide disclosure or evidence of extent of publication (see, for example, Dudley v Phillips [2022] EWHC 930 (QB) at [25]). Here, Mr Hamer submitted, not only were the relevant analytical data not preserved or disclosed, but a deliberate decision was made by the Defendants to provide no evidence of the extent of the publications for which they were responsible, and therefore not to submit themselves to cross-examination about it. In those circumstances, Mr Harmer submitted, readership of at least tens of thousands could fairly be inferred in relation to any and all of the publications complained of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have reflected carefully on Dr Schestowitz’s challenge, Mr Hamer’s submissions and Dr Garrett’s evidence. I bear in mind the years-long persistence, cross-referencing and indexing apparent within the articles. I can and do place weight on the evidence I have to suggest that the publications complained of were accessible to, and accessed by, a UK public searching online for information about Dr Garrett. It is common ground that Techrights and Tuxmachines are popular and authoritative sites, including in the UK, among those interested or active in the free software community. I do not understand it to be in dispute that that wider community in the UK is otherwise than substantial, perhaps in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Dr Garrett is, I have accepted, someone with a profile in that community, and the allegations in the articles complained of are of a sensational and eye-catching nature (and tone). In these circumstances, it appears to me that a total readership of the articles to date, including by way of some onward republication (percolation), of the order of at least thousands is more probably than not a fair estimate. And if there are doubts about that, Dr Garrett is entitled to rely on the Armory principle to have them resolved in his favour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inherent Probabilities and Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A readership of at least thousands makes a fair case, in context, for regarding this as an example of ‘mass publication’. It is not of the order of a national newspaper or news channel. But nor is it a case dealing with publication to a limited class of identified or identifiable individuals. Just as important as the raw numbers is the identity of the likely readership. I am satisfied that publication in this case was to precisely the constituency – individuals in the UK interested in the free software community and in the doings of free software activists, and who had either already heard of or were likely to take an interest in Dr Garrett – with which Dr Garrett’s UK reputation was most closely engaged. I have to consider that in conjunction with the gravity of the allegations. Sockpuppetry, trolling, inappropriate sexual content and hate speech are allegations of profound breaches of the ‘netiquette’ of this community in their own right. The accusations about the content of this behaviour – serious online crime – push those allegations to the extremes of gravity in context. Coupled with the imputations going to Dr Garrett’s offline private life, including sexual misconduct (or crime) and the habitual use of illegal class A drugs, it is hard to imagine a more serious assault on the professional and personal reputation of a prominent free software activist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these circumstances, I accept Dr Garrett’s case that not only is the inherent meaning of the publications complained of grave, but they have caused and are likely to cause him serious reputational harm. Indeed, on the basis of the factual matrix advanced and established, and mindful of the guidance in Blake v Fox, the inference of serious harm may have to be regarded as inescapable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Statutory Defences to Defamation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statutory defences provided by the Defamation Act 2013 are set out as follows, as relevant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Defences&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;2.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Truth&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subsection (3) applies in an action for defamation if the statement complained of conveys two or more distinct imputations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If one or more of the imputations is not shown to be substantially true, the defence under this section does not fail if, having regard to the imputations which are shown to be substantially true, the imputations which are not shown to be substantially true do not seriously harm the claimant's reputation..&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;3.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Honest opinion&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the following conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first condition is that the statement complained of was a statement of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The second condition is that the statement complained of indicated, whether in general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The third condition is that an honest person could have held the opinion on the basis of—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any fact which existed at the time the statement complained of was published;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;anything asserted to be a fact in a privileged statement published before the statement complained of.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(5)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The defence is defeated if the claimant shows that the defendant did not hold the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(7)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of subsection (4)(b) a statement is a “privileged statement” if the person responsible for its publication would have one or more of the following defences if an action for defamation were brought in respect of it—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;a defence under section 4 (publication on matter of public interest);&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;4.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Publication on matter of public interest&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest; and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the defendant reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subject to subsections (3) and (4), in determining whether the defendant has shown the matters mentioned in subsection (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the statement complained of was, or formed part of, an accurate and impartial account of a dispute to which the claimant was a party, the court must in determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that publishing the statement was in the public interest disregard any omission of the defendant to take steps to verify the truth of the imputation conveyed by it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest, the court must make such allowance for editorial judgement as it considers appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(5)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, the defence under this section may be relied upon irrespective of whether the statement complained of is a statement of fact or a statement of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All three defences are pleaded in the present case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Truth Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pleading and evidence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pleading of the truth defence – that is, the pleading that what is said about Dr Garrett in the publications complained of, in the natural and ordinary meanings I have determined, is in objective fact true – relies on (a) a small number of messages Dr Garrett accepts he posted and (b) his asserted authorship of a campaign of threats, abuse and harassment conducted from a list of named sockpuppet accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorship or control of these accounts has consistently been strenuously denied by Dr Garrett. I have no evidence from the Defendants to support it. Instead, they necessarily rely on an inferential case built on a limited number of pleaded facts, some of which are undisputed. I consider them in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the defence relies on an incident a few years prior to the sockpuppet campaign, in which Dr Garrett admittedly registered himself online in two borrowed names for the purpose of making a rhetorical or satirical point about the owner of those names. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he did so openly, and with the knowledge of the owner (who had himself vacated the names in order to borrow another user’s nickname – which was in part Dr Garrett’s point in also doing so). Dr Schestowitz clearly takes exception to that particular piece of theatricality as a major breach of netiquette in its own right, and regards it as a sign or symptom of propensity for sockpuppetry. But the incident in question, on its face, is plainly something quite different from the covert use of sockpuppet accounts to publish illegal or offensive material, and is not in my judgment capable of indicating any sort of propensity to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, it is said there was an incident in which Dr Garrett’s own named account and one of the sockpuppet accounts experienced simultaneous dropped connections. If established, that could indicate dual operation by a single individual. The evidence from the Claimant is that the dropped connections were not in fact simultaneous. I have no evidential basis for doing otherwise than proceeding on that basis. This pleading cannot in the circumstances support an inference of Dr Garrett’s authorship of the sockpuppet posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, there are some facts pleaded which are capable of linking the sockpuppets to each other. They are not capable of being linked to Dr Garrett by that means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, it is pleaded that after Dr Schestowitz had made a complaint naming Dr Garrett as the suspected author of the complaints, they subsided. I have no evidence of this – of its extent, timing, or at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, it is suggested there is some similarity in the language used by Dr Garrett in his own account and that in one of the sockpuppet accounts. That suggested similarity is not particularised. I was not taken to it by Dr or Mrs Schestowitz. It is not immediately obvious on the face of the publications complained of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sixth, one of the sockpuppet accounts on one occasion posted a short insult in the Irish language. Dr Garrett’s evidence is that he does not speak Irish and would have been incapable of posting that insult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seventh, it is suggested that one of the sockpuppet accounts used the first person singular in referring to an accusation made against Dr Garrett. I was not taken to this example, or its context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took me to a small number of posts Dr Garrett had made on a website he had operated some 25 years ago, when he would have been aged about 20. In one, he made a comment about people feeling the need to punch someone. In another he referred to being sorely tempted to write a book entitled Axe-murdering for fun and profit as a disincentive to people bothering him. In a third he expressed exasperation with some individuals along lines that it made him want to stab them and then stab himself. In a later social media post in 2018 on Twitter (X), he was involved in a game of listing criteria for electing a new prime minister, in which he proposed ‘1. Cancel Brexit; 2. Decriminalise most drugs; 3. Spend less on candles [an internet meme]; 4. Resign’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no difficulty in immediately recognising all of these as examples of jocular or facetious rhetoric. Dr Garrett’s own evidence was that he now considered them callow and in poor taste; they were mostly decades old, and he would not express himself in this kind of way any longer. Dr Schestowitz plainly regarded them as unpleasant breaches of netiquette. But the proposition that these examples should be taken literally, and this sort of online discourse considered indicative of a propensity in real life to the use of sockpuppetry to threaten or commit violence, or to an illegal drugs habit, cannot begin to get off the ground. They are clearly nowhere near any such thing. Nor are such allusions to bladed weaponry as they contain any sort of basis for inferring that sockpuppet accounts under names such as ‘Dr Axe’ were being operated by Dr Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is Dr Garrett’s evidence that at least some of the sockpuppet posts were posted at a time when he can establish he was teaching a university class. It is also his evidence that it was not practically possible for him to have been the author of those posts, both because he did not have access to the IRC channel on his phone and because he could not have done so without attracting the attention of his students.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assessment and conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is plain that the onslaught of sockpuppet trolling to which Mrs Schestowitz in particular was subjected was a truly appalling experience – the very antithesis of everything Tuxmachines and Techrights stands for in the free software community. There is not the slightest suggestion that either Dr or Mrs Schestowitz did anything to invite or deserve it. They are both clearly and justifiably angered, dismayed, distressed and hurt by it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also plain that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz do not think highly of Dr Garrett in general. Some of that appears to have had its origins in differences of professional views. Some of it may be to do with his choices to move to Silicon Valley and to work for, with or alongside big tech companies; Dr Schestowitz explained clearly to me how and why they themselves have made different choices. Some of it may be to do with Dr Garrett’s modes of online expression and what they consider to be his poor netiquette; Dr and Mrs Schestowitz explained to me that these are matters they take very seriously, and that they are serious people running serious websites dealing in serious technical and socio-political matters. They do not admire facetiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also plain enough that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have found it entirely straightforward to convince themselves that Dr Garrett was behind the trolling. But the task they have given themselves in pleading the truth defence in defamation proceedings is to establish or prove, on the balance of probabilities, that that is objectively true. And they have made that exceptionally difficult for themselves by advancing no evidence for it. I can only uphold a truth defence if I am given a sufficient evidential basis for doing so. I have looked hard at the defence as pleaded. I can recognise the matters I have been shown, in all the contextual circumstances, as the reasons Dr and Mrs Schestowitz advance to explain their suspicions of Dr Garrett. But I cannot possibly recognise in them, singly or together, anything capable of establishing the objective truth that Dr Garrett was their troll. They are simply not capable of sustaining the weight of a truth defence, or enabling me properly to find that, more probably than not, what the publications said about Dr Garrett was the verifiable truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make such a finding, I would have both to reject Dr Garrett’s own clear evidence, and to discount the possibility that, if Dr and Mrs Schestowitz suspected Dr Garrett of the posts, some third party operator(s) responsible for the sockpuppets might at some level have encouraged that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found Dr Garrett in general a straightforward witness who gave a clear account of himself under sustained challenge in the witness box. I have been given no proper basis for rejecting his plain, unqualified and vehement denial that he ever had anything to do with the sockpuppet campaign against Dr and Mrs Schestowitz. The matters pleaded by way of the truth defence barely raise a statable case that he did. I accept Dr Garrett’s evidence. He is entitled in these circumstances to a clear finding that I have not been shown any evidence on which I can fairly place any weight, that he was responsible for the sockpuppets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being so, there is no such evidence before me that Dr Garrett habitually uses illegal class A drugs. There is no such evidence he has committed any crimes. There is no such evidence he has threatened, abused or harassed anyone, or that he has espoused or promulgated repugnant and hateful views. There is no basis on which I can properly find any of the many factual accusations levelled against him in the publications complained of to be true. The truth defence must fail in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Honest Opinion Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The honest opinion defence is pleaded bare, otherwise than by reference to the allegation that Dr Garrett was responsible for the sockpuppet trolling. In the meanings I have determined, the allegations identified as matters of opinion are all identified as descriptors of the content of the campaign he is alleged to have pursued. That is the only ‘basis of opinion’ articulated in the articles complained of for the purposes of section 3(3) of the Defamation Act 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, as I have concluded, I am unable to uphold the contended factual truth of Dr Garrett’s responsibility for the sockpuppet trolling, that is not a basis on which the honest opinion defence can be upheld either. An honest person has no basis in contemporaneous fact, as required by section 3(4)(a), for an opinion that Dr Garrett was responsible for an offensive and hateful campaign, when he cannot be shown to have been responsible for the campaign at all. The honest opinion defence is unsustainable accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Public Interest Defence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have reminded myself of the review of the authorities on this defence set out by Nicklin J in Turley v Unite The Union [2019] EWHC 3547 (QB) at [137]-[138]. A three stage approach has to be taken. Stage one asks whether the statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matter of public interest. The second establishes whether the defendant believed publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest. The third asks whether any such belief was reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pleading of the defence in the present case addresses the first question by asserting that all the statements complained of were publications on a matter of public interest, namely ‘the exposure of a vicious and persistent troll committing, among other wrongs, communication and harassment offences in an attempt by the Claimant to intimidate and obstruct promotion of computing standards argued for by the Defendants and that have wide significance within the field of computing’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authorities guide that public interest is a broad concept in this context, and can be considered in the light of whether publications make a contribution to a matter of public debate, but is distinguishable from matters that are personal or private. I can see that the promotion of high standards of online behaviour, and the calling out of unlawful, intimidatory or suppressive behaviour, are capable of being included in the broad ambit of a ‘matter of public interest’. The question here would really be about whether any of the publications complained of is recognisable as contributing to it. Dr and Mrs Schestowitz took a decision not to write general articles about the trolling they had received (nor, indeed, it would appear, to block the sockpuppet accounts), but instead (a) to republish quantities of it and (b) to attribute it to Dr Garrett in strongly and personally deprecatory terms. There can be little doubt on a fair reading of the articles that their focus is squarely on attacking Dr Garrett rather than any more objective or issues-based purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any event, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz face a major hurdle at the second stage of the test, because I have no evidence as to their beliefs at the time of publication. Here is what Nicklin J said at [138(vii)] in Turley v Unite:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A defendant wishing to rely upon the defence must have believed what s/he published was in the public interest: Economou [139(2)] and [153] per Warby J (at first instance: [2017] EMLR 4). The defendant must have addressed his/her mind to the issue. This element of the defence is not established by showing that a notional reasonable person could have believed that the publication was in the public interest, but that the relevant defendant did believe that it was. In terms of evidence, if a defendant leaves this issue unaddressed in his/her witness evidence, the defence is likely to fail at this initial hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the present case, of course, there is no witness evidence from either defendant at all. They are required to establish their state of mind by setting it out in evidence. They have not done so. I cannot just assume it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the third stage, had they been able to reach that far, the problems for sustaining this defence would only multiply. The reasonableness of any subjective public interest belief has to be tested objectively, including by probing what a publisher had done and not done to ‘guard as far as possible against the publication of untrue defamatory material’ and what checks and enquiries they had made. Here is Nicklin J again, at [138] of Turley v Unite:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(xv)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is a basic requirement of fairness and responsible journalism that someone who is going to publish a defamatory allegation against a person without being required to show that it is true should give him/her a fair opportunity to put his/her side of the story; … This is not only to be fair to the subject, it recognises that the subject may well have relevant factual information to provide that may affect the decision to publish or the terms in which the publication is presented… . The importance of making an attempt to present the subject of the publication’s side of the story may require the publisher to consider whether others who could reasonably be expected to have relevant information about the allegations should be approached… .&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(xvi)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Although … it will not always be necessary to approach the subject of a defamatory article for comment prior to publication, the circumstances in which a publisher will be able to satisfy the Court that it was reasonable not to have done so will necessarily be rare… .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no evidence as to any due diligence undertaken before the articles complained of were published. The defence is pleaded by reference to the reasonableness of reliance on the assemblage of matters I have considered in relation to the truth defence above, which, for the reasons I have given, are not reasonably recognisable as an exercise in considered research and verification. Dr Garrett was not approached to give his side of the story. One of the articles complained of (publication 14 and 15) reproduced a paragraph from a letter Dr Garrett had written on 5th August 2023, stating that ‘As I have previously informed you via email, I am not responsible for the elusive_woman IRC account or any of the other accounts you have incorrectly asserted I am linked to. I have provided evidence that I am not that person’ – namely that one of the postings from the account mentioned was made at a time he was teaching a class. The letter had gone on to challenge Dr Schestowitz for appearing to accept that others might have been involved in the trolling, but that part of the letter was not reproduced. Beneath the (cropped) picture of the letter was commentary beginning ‘Oh, wow! How will I know if you are lying again?’ and continuing with invective and multiple accusations against him. This has little claim to being in the nature of affording a fair right of reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Schestowitz made an eloquent case to me for the websites he and his wife operate being quintessentially public interest, not-for-profit endeavours, conscientiously dedicated to the interests of the free software community, trusted and well-regarded as such. I can accept that. I can also easily understand that he and Mrs Schestowitz had felt attacked and threatened by the sockpuppet trolling, on both a personal basis and on behalf of all they were trying to do and achieve with their websites. That is not, however, enough to engage the public interest defence to publication of libels that cannot be shown to be true, blaming and defaming someone for the trolling on no better basis than that produced in these proceedings. Any belief in the public interest in naming and shaming Dr Garrett – repeatedly, and in the most personal and derogatory terms – on such a basis could not in my judgment be regarded as a reasonable one for the purposes of the defence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these circumstances, the public interest defence inevitably fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary and conclusions on liability in defamation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are proud of Techrights and Tuxmachines – their lives’ dedicated labour, passion and achievement. They are proud of the websites’ decades-long record of hosting an important and well-regarded IRC for the free software community in the UK and beyond, and of the thousands of informed and informative articles the websites have carried, including the results of some significant investigative journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were understandably horrified to become the victims of an anonymous internet campaign of abuse, threats and harassment a couple of years ago. Nothing could have been further from the websites’ ethos, and it must have been traumatising for them on a personal level. Their response was publicly and repeatedly to blame Dr Garrett for it all, having convinced themselves they had some reasons for suspecting him of being behind the anonymous trolling – and to do so in a manner that was bitter, highly personal and thoroughly derogatory. They were undeterred by his protests that he had nothing to do with it. They steadfastly refused to take their accusatory material down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett has been successful in advancing a defamation claim to the point at which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz are required by law either to concede the claim or defend it. They chose to defend it, but they chose to do so without advancing any evidence in support of their defences. A court’s job is to apply the law to the facts as it finds them, and to find the relevant facts according to the evidence before it. If it is provided with no evidence in support of a libel defence, there is a limit to what a court can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have considered the defences pleaded by Dr and Mrs Schestowitz as best I can, given that they provided me with no evidence to work with. The bases they advanced for their suspicions that Dr Garrett was behind the sockpuppet trolling were simply not capable in the circumstances of adding up to an evidential proof on which a court could properly find that was, objectively, true. That allegation was at the heart of their resistance to Dr Garrett’s claim, and they have not enabled me properly to do anything other than reject it as capable of founding a defence, either by establishing that they had done due diligence at the time, or by advancing evidence or proof of objective truth I could consider at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A defamation claimant in these circumstances is entitled to a judgment, and to remedies, which repudiate the publications complained of, vindicate his reputation, and restore his good name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Data Protection Claim&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Hamer indicated to me at trial that, in the event that I upheld Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation, I could consider myself invited to conclude that it was unnecessary for me to consider the data protection claim on its merits. In the circumstances, I accept that invitation. Although the data protection claim extends to a number of publications additional to those on which the libel claim was based, and although it extends to the processing of Dr Garrett’s personal data in forms other than publication, I am satisfied that embarking on a full analysis of the data protection claim would be disproportionate to any additional vindicatory justice, or remedies, it could potentially achieve for Dr Garrett.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Harassment Counterclaim&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides as follows, as material:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;1.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Prohibition of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A person must not pursue a course of conduct—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which amounts to harassment of another, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(1A) A person must not pursue a course of conduct —&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which involves harassment of two or more persons, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;which he knows or ought to know involves harassment of those persons, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(c)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;by which he intends to persuade any person (whether or not one of those mentioned above)—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(i)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;not to do something that he is entitled or required to do, or&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(ii)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;to do something that he is not under any obligation to do.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this section …, the person whose course of conduct is in question ought to know that it amounts to or involves harassment of another if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct amounted to harassment of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;3.&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Civil remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An actual or apprehended breach of section 1(1) may be the subject of a claim in civil proceedings by the person who is or may be the victim of the course of conduct in question.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On such a claim, damages may be awarded for (among other things) any anxiety caused by the harassment and any financial loss resulting from the harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;3A. Injunctions to protect persons from harassment within section 1(1A)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This section applies where there is an actual or apprehended breach of section 1(1A) by any person (“ the relevant person ”).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In such a case—&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(a)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any person who is or may be a victim of the course of conduct in question, or&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(b)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;any person who is or may be a person falling within section 1(1A)(c),&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;may apply to the High Court or the county court for an injunction restraining the relevant person from pursuing any conduct which amounts to harassment in relation to any person or persons mentioned or described in the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz’s counterclaim is pleaded by reference to Dr Garrett’s alleged responsibility for the sockpuppet course of conduct. For the reasons I have already given, I cannot make the necessary findings of fact on which that allegation inevitably relies. The counterclaim as pleaded necessarily fails for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the trial hearing, Dr and Mrs Schestowitz also made extensive and sustained submissions objecting to the manner in which Dr Garrett and his legal team have been conducting this litigation against them. It is plain that they have both, in general, found the experience of being proceeded against for libel intrusive, frightening and intimidatory. I was told that they experienced it as motivated by an intention to harm them and their websites financially, and to interfere with their investigative journalism. They objected specifically to Dr Garrett’s having made contact with their internet service provider and other web hosts in an attempt to have the publications taken down, to the obtaining of their postal and online contact details, to the threatening tone of solicitors’ correspondence, to the conduct of the disclosure process, to the conduct by the same firm of solicitors of a second set of proceedings against them which Dr and Mrs Schestowitz had unsuccessfully sought to have consolidated with Dr Garrett’s claim, and to a reference made in formal documentation to a previous name of Mrs Schestowitz, a matter to which she took extremely strong exception. They felt, in short, that they had been ‘harassed’ by this litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I emphasise that none of this formed any part of their counterclaim as pleaded, nor is it evidenced, and I am not as a result in any proper position to make any findings of liability in harassment based on it. I also had to explain the constraints of legal professional privilege on some of the matters Dr and Mrs Schestowitz wanted to explore with Dr Garrett and his solicitor under cross-examination, in relation to their counterclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to record also that Dr Garrett in turn takes strong exception to the manner in which Dr Schestowitz has himself conducted this litigation as a litigant in person. Mr Hamer referred to what he considered to be racist attacks on Dr Garrett’s lawyers, posted on Techrights, which he described as probably the worst example he had seen of such conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this may need to be explored further if and when it comes to the stage of dealing with the costs of this litigation. That is a matter on which the parties will need to reflect following hand-down of this judgment. It may be that formal submissions and witness evidence may in due course be needed to resolve it. But none of it is properly relevant to the determination of liability on the counterclaim as pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the reasons I have given, I cannot be satisfied that, more probably than not, Dr Garrett was responsible for the course of conduct comprising the sockpuppet trolling. The counterclaim must fail accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remedies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libel damages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The starting point for any award of damages in any tort is that the court should award a sum of money which will, as nearly as possible, restore the injured party to the same position he would have been in had the tort never been committed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the nature and history of libel, and its focus on reputational harm and the restorative vindication of reputation, has resulted in the evolution of a distinctive approach to assessing damages for defamation. As Nicklin J observed in Monir v Wood [2018] EWHC 3525 QB at [228], ‘Damages for libel cannot be calculated on any mathematical basis. By definition, they seek to provide compensation for harm that it is almost impossible to quantify in monetary terms’. The exercise is necessarily therefore a broad and holistic one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is further underlined by Nicklin J in his observations in Lachaux v Independent Print[2021] EWHC 1797 (QB) at [227] about claims for aggravated damages in defamation (of which this is one):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In my judgment, separating out a specific award for aggravated damages is unnecessary and, I consider, generally unwise. The Court’s task is to assess the proper level of compensation, taking into account all the relevant factors, which include any elements of aggravation. If, as the authorities recognise, the assessment of libel damages can never be mechanical or scientific, attributing a specific figure to something as nebulous as aggravation has an unconvincing foundation. Worse, as it would represent the imposition of a clearly identified additional sum of money, it risks the appearance of being directly attributed to the conduct of the defendant. That comes perilously close to looking like a penalty. For these reasons, I consider the better course is to fix a single award which, faithful to the principles by which damages in defamation are assessed, is solely to compensate the Claimant. The award can properly reflect any additional hurt and distress caused to the Claimant by the conduct of the Defendants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as being broad and holistic, the exercise is also highly fact-specific. But the framework of principle does include maintaining broad comparability within the tort and between torts. So regard may be had to other awards in defamation cases of a comparable nature (although the authorities emphasise that no two defamation cases are ever really the same). Regard may also be had to the (very differently assessed) awards in personal injury cases to ensure that damages for defamation are, and are seen to be, proportionate and realistic. But these comparative exercises are by way of guidance only, and the focus must remain, intensely, on the circumstances of the individual case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relevant legal principles particularly applicable to assessing libel damages were set out clearly by Warby J (as he then was) in Sloutsker v Romanova[2015] EWHC 2053 at [74]-[82], and in Barron v Vines [2016] EWHC 1226 at [20]-[21]. Broadly, the purpose of an award of damages in defamation proceedings is to compensate for injury to reputation and to feelings, and in particular to vindicate claimants, so far as money can to do that. Vindication and compensation are not to be thought of in compartmentalised terms: the overall purpose of the award remains to restore a claimant, to the extent money can do so, to the position as if the libel had not occurred. But in defamation cases that means not only redressing the balance in terms of quantifiable losses, but unequivocally, albeit proportionately, restoring a claimant’s standing to its previous state. As the authorities put it, the sum awarded must be an outward and visible sign of vindication, sending a message restoring a claimant’s good name ‘sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge’. If an award fails to achieve vindication, it fails properly to compensate and restore the status quo ante.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In assessing damages, the court takes account of all the relevant facts, and in particular the gravity of the defamation, the extent of its publication, and evidence of the harm it has done. The award must in the end be no more than is justified by the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of that aim, and proportionate to that need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive relief&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive relief is regularly afforded to successful defamation claimants, to restrain the publication of the same or similar libel. Final injunctive relief, restraining publication post-judgment, is distinctively different from pre-trial interim relief, since the implication of the judgment is necessarily that the published libel is not a species of free speech protected by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Nicklin J’s observation about permanent, post-judgment, injunction in Lachauxat [239] was that ‘it is the natural remedy that flows from the Court’s decision’, and, in the absence of satisfactory undertakings, it may be necessary to injunct further publication to give full effect to that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, importantly, it remains a discretionary remedy. It is not available as of right. In considering whether to exercise its discretion, and if so how, a court will have regard to all the circumstances of a case, including the conduct of the parties, and will focus in particular on assessing the risk of repetition of the defamation should injunctive relief not be granted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order for publication of judgment summary&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 12 of the Defamation Act 2013 provides as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Power of court to order a summary of its judgment to be published&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(1)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Where a court gives judgment for the claimant in an action for defamation the court may order the defendant to publish a summary of the judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(2)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The wording of any summary and the time, manner, form and place of its publication are to be for the parties to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(3)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the parties cannot agree on the wording, the wording is to be settled by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;section&gt;(4)&lt;/section&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If the parties cannot agree on the time, manner, form or place of publication, the court may give such directions as to those matters as it considers reasonable and practicable in the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(5)…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As confirmed by Monir v Wood at [239]-[242], the power to order publication of a judgment summary is itself a distinct incursion into a defendant’s rights to freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 of the ECHR, and must be exercised mindfully of that. The incursion involved must be justified by reference to the legitimate aim of protecting reputation, and necessary and proportionate to that aim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum of damages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant relevant factors in the present case seem to me to be these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, there is the gravity of the libellous allegations in this case which, in multiple and detailed respects, profoundly impugn Dr Garrett’s personal integrity, social standing and professional credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, there is the fact that they were published from websites regarded as authoritative and reliable, and repeatedly, to the very audience – including the free software community in England – in which Dr Garrett’s reputation here is most deeply invested, and which has the highest capacity to think the worse of him as a result. This was a substantial audience estimated to be of the order of at least thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, there is the fact that Dr and Mrs Schestowitz have insisted on the truth of their allegations all the way to trial, have offered no evidence for it, have refused to take down the material complained of and have made no retraction of or apology for the content. They appear to have thought that this was a point of journalistic principle and integrity, but they do not appear to have engaged in that capacity with the need or desirability for doing more, when faced with Dr Garrett’s assurances that he had nothing to do with the sockpuppet accounts, than simply dismissing them as probable lies. Mrs Schestowitz did however, in her closing submissions at trial, offer Dr Garrett an apology to the extent of having hurt his feelings. I thought that was at least well-intentioned and genuine, and I give her credit for it. I note also that, while Dr Schestowitz challenged Dr Garrett hard in a range of matters under cross-examination, he did so courteously and without directly maintaining the underlying truth of the content of the allegations beyond those of his responsibility for the trolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, I note Dr Garrett’s evidence that the libels have caused him to fear for his professional and academic reputation, for the security of his employment and for his future employment prospects. He has had experience of being approached directly by a colleague and a former colleague over the content of the publications and had to defend himself, and has suffered the natural anxiety and humiliation of wondering what others are thinking of him and whether he may be being avoided or overlooked for opportunities because of what has been said about him. I bear in mind also that he does not suggest there is evidence to date that he has suffered actual employment detriment, and I note the strength of his professional reputation and the extent to which that might be able in itself to be robust to the depredations of gossip and rumour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Hamer asks for a single global sum to vindicate Dr Garrett’s reputation and compensate him for distress in relation to all the publications complained of. He proposed a range of comparator decisions for my consideration, in support of a submission that libel damages approaching £100,000 would be appropriate. I have considered these. I noted in particular the case of Fentiman v Marsh [2019] EWHC 2099 in which an award of £55,000 was made in respect of allegations in a blog read by about 500 people that the claimant, a company CEO, was a hacker responsible for illegal cyber-attacks on a company. The tone of the allegations there were something comparable to those in the present case – somewhat personally and floridly put. I hold the effects of inflation in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my judgment, in all these circumstances, the minimum sum necessary to convince a fair-minded bystander of the baselessness of the allegations against him, to vindicate his reputation and restore his standing, and to compensate him for the consequences he has suffered, is £70,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Injunctive Relief&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz continue to publish and republish the libels. They have no entitlement to do so. This is not a form of freedom of expression which is protected by law. They have published further similar defamatory statements since the commencement of these proceedings. In the absence of any indication that they will voluntarily desist, remove the material objected to, and give satisfactory undertakings not to repeat the same or similar allegations, they face being compelled to do so by means of an injunction enforceable by proceedings for contempt of court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 12 Order&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A principal consideration in deciding whether to exercise the discretion to compel publication of a summary of a libel judgment is whether it is likely to be effective in coming to the attention of those to whom the original libel was published, and therefore in undoing its original reputational harm and vindicating the claimant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publication of a short summary of this judgment on Techrights and Tuxmachines would, in my view, be likely to be effective in reaching the UK audience to which the libels were published. It would be a clear statement to the free software community here that Dr Garrett cannot be regarded as having any stain on his character arising out of the accusations carried by those websites and complained of in these proceedings. That would, in my judgment, be a necessary and proportionate means of vindicating and protecting his reputation and rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decision&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Garrett’s claim in defamation succeeds. He is entitled to the vindication of this judgment, and to the remedies I have indicated. The counterclaim of Dr and Mrs Schestowitz in harassment is dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr and Mrs Schestowitz experienced appalling anonymous abuse, threats and harassment online. They reacted by using their websites – well-established, respected and trusted in the free software community, and carrying their own personal authority as free software activists – to blame and upbraid Dr Garrett for being responsible for this, and to vilify him accordingly. They have been unable to establish any recognisable basis in law for doing so. They have advanced no evidence for it; I was shown nothing in these proceedings capable of establishing in a court of law that Dr Garrett was in fact responsible or had anything to do with it. Their own campaign of allegations is not in these circumstances a lawful exercise of free speech, much less an example of investigative journalism. It is unsubstantiated character assassination and it must stop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; A 21 year old bug report requesting support of the XDG Base Directory specification is finally being addressed by Firefox. The Firefox 147 release should respect this XDG specification around where files should be positioned within Linux users' home directory. &lt;lb/&gt;The XDG Base Directory specification lays out where application data files, configuration files, cached assets, and other files and file formats should be positioned within a user's home directory and the XDG environment variables for accessing those locations.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Banished Bottom of the Housing Market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How America Destroyed Its Cheapest Homes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, a young man down on his luck in a new city is more likely to land in jail or on the street than on his feet. Fifty years ago, he had another option. A place to wash up, get a hot meal, meet other young men—even start over. All he had to do was put his pride on the shelf and get himself to—well, you can spell it out: the YMCA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Village People’s 1978 disco hit celebrated one of the less-remembered services offered by the YMCA. From the 1860s, the YMCA began building single-room occupancy (SRO) units “to give young men moving from rural areas safe and affordable lodging in the city.” At its peak in 1940, the YMCA had more than 100,000 rooms—“more than any hotel chain at the time.” The Y wasn’t the only provider of such housing; indeed, there was a vibrant market for hotel living that existed well into the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variously and derogatively known by many names—rooming houses, lodging houses, flophouses—SROs provided affordable, market-rate housing to those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. SROs were the cheapest form of residential hotels, specializing in furnished single rooms for individuals, usually with shared kitchens and bathrooms. A typical SRO rent in 1924 was $230 per month—in today’s dollars.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As late as 1990, as many as two million people lived in residential hotels—more than lived “in all of America’s public housing”—according to Paul Groth, author of Living Downtown.2 Today, not so much. SROs like those offered by the YMCA were the safety net that kept many people off the streets—and their disappearance from the housing supply explains much of modern-day homelessness. What we destroyed wasn’t just a housing type but an entire urban ecosystem: one that provided flexibility, independence, and affordability at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with so much of our urban history, this destruction was by design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, hotel living was a normal way of life for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. As hotelkeeper Simeon Ford colorfully put it in 1903, “We have fine hotels for fine people, good hotels for good people, plain hotels for plain people, and some bum hotels for bums.” SROs, the “bum hotels,” were the backbone of affordable housing, serving “a great army” of low-paid but skilled workers. Clustered in lively downtown districts with restaurants and services that acted as extensions of the home, SROs offered liberation from family supervision and the constraints of Victorian mores. Rooming house districts let young people mix freely and even allowed same-sex couples to live discreetly—signs of a more secular, modern urban culture. Downtown hotel life, Groth notes, “had the promise to be not just urban but urbane.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And therein lay the problem: the urbanity of SROs collided head-on with the moralism of the Progressive Era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reformers drew on a long tradition of anti-urban bias, seeing the emergent twentieth-century city as a problem, with cheap hotels at its heart. They pathologized hotel dwellers as “friendless, isolated, needy, and disabled” and cast SROs as “caldrons of social and cultural evil.” Some of the cheapest hotels were unsafe and exploitative, but reformers cared less about improving conditions than about what the hotels symbolized. They blamed rooming houses for loneliness, sexual licentiousness, civic apathy—even suicide. To them, the presence of “social misfits” proved that hotels caused moral disorder. In reality, people lived in SROs because they were cheap and offered greater independence—especially for career-oriented young women. Firm in their belief in the “One Best Way to live,” the reformers exalted the single-family home as the “bulwark of good citizenship” and succeeded in stigmatizing hotel life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the turn of the century, they set their sights on changing the law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning in the late 19th century, reformers used building and health codes to erase what they saw as “aberrant social lives.” San Francisco’s early building ordinances targeted Chinese lodging houses, while later codes outlawed cheap wooden hotels altogether. By the early 1900s, cities and states were classifying lodging houses as public nuisances. Other laws increased building standards and mandated plumbing fixtures, raising costs and slowing new construction. Urban reformers next embraced exclusionary zoning to separate undesirable people and noxious uses from residential areas. SROs were deemed inappropriate in residential zones, and many codes banned the mixed-use districts that sustained them. In cities like San Francisco, zoning was used to erect a “cordon sanitaire” around the prewar city “to keep old city ideas from contaminating the new.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residential hotels, like apartments, were swept into the same category of “mere parasitic” uses that Euclid v. Ambler—the 1926 case that upheld zoning—treated as potential health hazards. Redlining and federal loan criteria starved urban hotels of capital, while planners simply omitted them from surveys and censuses—as if their residents didn’t exist. By the urban renewal era, the existence of the old city was itself seen as an affront, and it, too, had to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In effect, SROs became a “deliberate casualty” of the new city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic and policy shifts hastened their decline. Industrial jobs moved to peripheral locations only accessible by car, urban highway expansion targeted lodging-house neighborhoods, and cities encouraged office development on increasingly valuable downtown land. The “moral blight” of hotel districts had increasingly become economic blight, necessitating renewal. And because SROs didn’t count as “permanent housing” in official statistics, clearance programs could claim to displace no one. San Francisco’s urban renewal experience was typical: redevelopment in and around the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center area ultimately eliminated an estimated 40,000 hotel rooms. The public housing that replaced hotel districts—if it was built at all—often failed to accommodate single adults. To bureaucrats, the bulldozer was salubrious, “eliminating dead tissue” and “clearing away the mistakes of the past.” To the people who lived there, it wiped out their last foothold in the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the mid-twentieth century, “millions” of SRO hotel rooms disappeared through closures, conversions, and demolition across major cities, and the modest hotel market that remained was shrinking fast. With almost no new SROs built since the 1930s, the remaining stock was vanishing by the thousands in the 1970s. New York City had 200,000 SROs when it banned new hotel construction in 1955; only 30,000 remained by 2014. As tenants changed and land values climbed, owners who once fought to save their lodging houses now wanted out; it was officials who suddenly wanted to preserve them. Tenant movements and new government programs emerged in the 1970s and ’80s, but Reagan-era cuts gutted funding, and many remaining hotels decayed into the “street hotels” opponents had long imagined: unsanitary, unsafe, and unfit for all but the city’s most desperate residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, demand for SRO housing was rising sharply. In the 1970s, states emptied mental hospitals without funding alternatives, pushing thousands of people with serious needs into cheap downtown hotels unequipped to support them. What was left of the SRO system became America’s accidental asylum network—the last rung of shelter for those the state had abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of people were barely hanging on, and a full-blown homelessness crisis had emerged in American cities for the first time since the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SRO crisis was no accident, Groth argues, but the result of government policy at all levels that picked winners and losers in the housing market. The people we now call “chronically homeless” were once simply low-income tenants, housed by the private market in cheap rooms rather than by public programs. Once that market was dismantled, the result was predictable: the homelessness wave of the late 1970s and 1980s followed directly from the destruction of SROs. Today’s crisis—nearly 800,000 unhoused people in 2024—is the long tail of that loss, compounded by decades of underbuilding in expensive cities and soaring rents. As one advocate put it, “The people you see sleeping under bridges used to be valued members of the housing market. They aren’t anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Alex Horowitz of The Pew Charitable Trusts writes, if SROs had “grown since 1960 at about the same rate as the rest of the U.S. housing stock, the nation would have roughly 2.5 million more such units”—more than three times the number of homeless individuals. While we can’t rebuild the old SRO market we destroyed, cities now face a new opportunity: a vast surplus of obsolete office space that could be converted into inexpensive rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Horowitz argues cities should make shared housing—“co-living,” in today’s parlance—legal again. Office vacancies are soaring at the same time deeply affordable housing is vanishing. Horowitz and the architecture firm Gensler modeled what cities could actually build. Their analysis suggests that a vacant office tower could be converted into deeply affordable rooms for half the per-unit cost of new studio apartments. A typical 120–220 square foot unit with shared kitchens and bathrooms could rent to people earning 30–50% of area median income. Urban development has become so expensive that such conversions are likely to only be feasible if subsidized, but Horowitz argues that conversions offer a better way to leverage scarce public dollars: for instance, a $10 million budget might produce 125 co-living rooms instead of 35 studios, providing a way to scale deeply affordable housing much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a great idea—but in many cities, it’s illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While several cities have made efforts to undo SRO prohibitions, in many American metropolises, restrictions abound—from zoning that bans shared housing or residential uses in office districts to minimum-unit-size rules that outlaw SRO-scale rooms. Building codes with strict egress and corridor rules and ventilation requirements make conversions technically infeasible, while parking mandates add unnecessary costs. Meanwhile, “unrelated occupancy” limits prohibit the very household types SROs serve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these barriers is structural; every one is a policy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talk endlessly about the “missing middle.” But the real catastrophe was the “banished bottom”—the deliberate destruction of the cheapest rung of the housing ladder. Re-legalizing SROs won’t instantly restore a once deeply affordable housing market that provided housing at scale, but it would at least make it possible for cities to create a much cheaper form of housing that could benefit some of the 11 million extremely low-income renter households and the 800,000 homeless people in America. No city will meaningfully address the need for deeply affordable housing until it restores this missing rung—and accepts that not everyone needs a full apartment to have a full life. Surely, an SRO is better than a sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, while the YMCA is generally not in the SRO business anymore, its Austin branch is redeveloping itself as a mixed-use center with 90 deeply discounted affordable units for families. It’s a worthy project—but it highlights the gap: more than 80% of Austin’s homeless residents are single adults, the very group the Y once housed. We used to have a place they could go—but what happened to that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Y is as much a question as an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
