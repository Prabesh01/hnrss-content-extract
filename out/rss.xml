  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve all sat in those presentations. A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along. We‚Äôre so used to it we expect it. We accept it. We even consider it ‚Äòlearning‚Äô. As an educator I push against ‚Äòdeath by PowerPoint‚Äô and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach. The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills. Most often the only victims are our audience‚Äôs inspiration and interest. This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 16th 2003. NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit. Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them. Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one. Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The launch proceeded as normal. The crew settled into their mission. They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments. One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank. At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank. As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle‚Äôs left wing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing. Foam falling during launch was nothing new. It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place. But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth‚Äôs atmosphere during launch and re-entry. In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn‚Äôt know how it would respond to re-entry. There were a number of options. The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull. NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up. Or they could risk re-entry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides. The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia. This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint. The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks. NASA felt the engineers didn‚Äôt know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger. They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth‚Äôs atmosphere as normal. Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003. Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle‚Äôs left wing were abnormally high and then were lost. Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew. At 0912, as Columbia should have been approaching the runway, ground control heard reports from residents near Dallas that the shuttle had been seen disintegrating. Columbia was lost and with it her crew of seven. The oldest crew member was 48.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shuttle programme was on lock down, grounded for two years as the investigation began. The cause of the accident became clear: a hole in a tile on the left wing caused by the foam let the wing dangerously overheat until the shuttle disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The questions to answer included a very simple one: Why, given that the foam strike had occurred at a force massively out of test conditions had NASA proceeded with re-entry?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edward Tufte, a Professor at Yale University and expert in communication reviewed the slideshow the Boeing engineers had given NASA, in particular the above slide. His findings were tragically profound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, the slide had a misleadingly reassuring title claiming that test data pointed to the tile being able to withstand the foam strike. This was not the case but the presence of the title, centred in the largest font makes this seem the salient, summary point of this slide. This helped Boeing‚Äôs message be lost almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, the slide contains four different bullet points with no explanation of what they mean. This means that interpretation is left up to the reader. Is number 1 the main bullet point? Do the bullet points become less important or more? It‚Äôs not helped that there‚Äôs a change in font sizes as well. In all with bullet points and indents six levels of hierarchy were created. This allowed NASA managers to imply a hierarchy of importance in their head: the writing lower down and in smaller font was ignored. Actually, this had been where the contradictory (and most important) information was placed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there is a huge amount of text, more than 100 words or figures on one screen. Two words, ‚ÄòSOFI‚Äô and ‚Äòramp‚Äô both mean the same thing: the foam. Vague terms are used. Sufficient is used once, significant or significantly, five times with little or no quantifiable data. As a result this left a lot open to audience interpretation. How much is significant? Is it statistical significance you mean or something else?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally the single most important fact, that the foam strike had occurred at forces massively out of test conditions, is hidden at the very bottom. Twelve little words which the audience would have had to wade through more than 100 to get to. If they even managed to keep reading to that point. In the middle it does say that it is possible for the foam to damage the tile. This is in the smallest font, lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA‚Äôs subsequent report criticised technical aspects along with human factors. Their report mentioned an over-reliance on PowerPoint:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edward Tufte‚Äôs full report makes for fascinating reading. Since being released in 1987 PowerPoint has grown exponentially to the point where it is now estimated than thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day. Yet, PowerPoint is blamed by academics for killing critical thought. Amazon‚Äôs CEO Jeff Bezos has banned it from meetings. Typing text on a screen and reading it out loud does not count as teaching. An audience reading text off the screen does not count as learning. Imagine if the engineers had put up a slide with just: ‚Äúfoam strike more than 600 times bigger than test data.‚Äù Maybe NASA would have listened. Maybe they wouldn‚Äôt have attempted re-entry. Next time you‚Äôre asked to give a talk remember Columbia. Don‚Äôt just jump to your laptop and write out slides of text. Think about your message. Don‚Äôt let that message be lost amongst text. Death by PowerPoint is a real thing. Sometimes literally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Jamie&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Lucky 13: a look at Debian trixie&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After more than two years of development, the Debian Project has released its new stable version, Debian 13 ("trixie"). The release comes with the usual bounty of upgraded packages and more than 14,000 new packages; it also debuts Advanced Package Tool (APT) 3.0 as the default package manager and makes 64-bit RISC-V a supported architecture. There are few surprises with trixie, which is exactly what many Linux users are hoping for‚Äîa free operating system that just works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian's stable releases are aptly named; the project prioritizes stability over shipping the latest software. The freeze schedule for trixie called for a soft freeze in April, which meant that (for example) the KDE Plasma 6.4 release in June was too late to make the cut‚Äîeven though trixie was not released until August. Users who prefer to live on the edge will want to run another distribution or follow Debian development by running the testing release that previews the next stable version‚ÄîDebian 14 ("forky"). Truly adventurous users may take their chances with the unstable ("sid") release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, trixie is up-to-date enough for many folks; it includes GNOME 48, KDE Plasma 6.3, Xfce 4.20, GNU Emacs 30.1, GnuPG 2.4.7, LibreOffice 25.2, and more. Under the hood, it includes the most recent Linux LTS kernel (6.12.41), GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 14.2, GNU C Library (glibc) 2.41, LLVM/Clang 19, Python 3.13, Rust 1.85, and systemd 257. The release notes have a section for well-known software that compares the version in Debian 12 against Debian 13. While some of the versions lag a bit behind the upstream, they are not woefully outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project now supports six major hardware architectures: x86-64/amd64, 32-bit Arm with a hardware FPU (armhf), 64-bit Arm (arm64), IBM POWER8 or newer (ppc64el), IBM S/390 (s390x), and 64-bit RISC-V. The i386 architecture is not supported for trixie, though the project continues to build some i386 packages to run on 64-bit systems; users with i386 systems cannot upgrade to trixie. The MIPS architectures (mipsel and mis64el) have also been removed in trixie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Arm EABI (armel) port that targets older 32-bit Arm devices prior to Arm v7 is still supported with trixie, but this release is the end of the line. There is no installation media for armel systems, but users who have bookworm installed can upgrade to trixie if they have supported hardware: the Raspberry Pi 1, Zero, and Zero W are the only devices mentioned in the release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgrades from bookworm are supported, of course. The release notes suggest that users convert APT source files to the DEB822 format before the upgrade. APT 3.0 includes an "apt modernize-sources" command to convert APT data source files to DEB822, but that is not available in bookworm. Users are also expected to remove all third-party packages prior to running the upgrade. I tested the upgrade on one of my servers, after taking a snapshot to roll back to if needed, and all went smoothly. Users who are considering an upgrade should read the release notes carefully before forging ahead; in particular, users should be aware that it's possible (but not certain) for network interface names to change on upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For users who want to start fresh, Debian offers a variety of installer images and download methods; users can choose a 64MB minimal ISO image with the netboot installer, all the way up to a set of Blu-ray images. The project recommends using BitTorrent or Jigsaw Download (jigdo) for the largest images. BitTorrent probably needs no introduction, but jigdo is not as well-known. Jigdo is a method of downloading all of the individual packages for an image from multiple mirrors and then assembling them into an ISO image on the user's machine. It was a bit fiddly to use jigdo to download an image, but not overly so‚Äîand the speed of the whole process was comparable to simply downloading an ISO of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian's network install ("netinst") image is probably the best option for server installations and for experienced Linux users; it includes the packages required for a base install and then fetches the remaining software from Debian mirrors. Unlike the tiny netboot image, it includes the option of using either the graphical installer or the text-based installer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The installer is a bit of a throwback to an earlier era when users were expected to know a lot more about the workings of a Linux system. Users who have only worked with distributions like Fedora and Ubuntu will notice that installing Debian requires many more steps than other popular distributions. For example, many desktop distributions have eliminated the step of setting a password for the root user‚Äîinstead, it is generally assumed that the primary user will also be the system administrator, so the default is to give the primary user sudo privileges instead. Debian does not take that approach; &lt;del&gt;in fact, there is no way to give a user sudo privileges during installation. Setting up sudo has to be done manually after the installation is completed&lt;/del&gt; Update: Users can skip creation of a root account and the installer will then set up the regular user as an administrator with sudo permissions. Apologies for the error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some folks, installing Debian will be a bit of a chore and may even be confusing for users who are new to Linux. For example, the text-mode installer requires users to specify the device for GRUB boot loader installation, without providing a default. If one chooses an invalid partition, the installer tells the user that the operation has failed and drops back to a menu listing all the installation steps. Presumably if one picks the wrong partition it will happily install GRUB to that and render the system unbootable. This is not insurmountable for experienced Linux users, but it would no doubt be a hurdle for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More experienced Linux users are likely to appreciate the amount of control offered by the installer. For example, Fedora's recent web-based installer makes it difficult to even find the option to perform custom partitioning. Debian has a guided partitioning option for those who do not want to fuss with it, but the option to create custom partitions is not hidden from the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian has a better installation option for newer Linux users, though it is easy to miss: the live install images, which use the Calamares installer. Its workflow is more akin to the installation process one finds with Fedora and Ubuntu; it also sets up the primary user with sudo privileges rather than creating a root password. Unfortunately, the live images are not listed on the main page for installer images‚Äîthough they are mentioned, briefly, in the release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debian installer also has the option of using a Braille display and/or speech synthesizer voice for the installation. I have not tried these options, but they are available for users who need them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;X.org&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many distributions are in the process of phasing out X.org support for GNOME and KDE as the upstream projects have started doing so. For example, Fedora will remove X.org session support for GNOME in Fedora 43, and the plan is for Ubuntu to do the same in its upcoming 25.10 release. GNOME will be completely removing X.org support in GNOME 49, which is planned for September.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much has already been said about this, of course, and there is likely little new left to be said or that needs to be said. However, for users who still need or want X.org support, Debian 13 includes X.org sessions for GNOME and KDE. In testing trixie, I've spent some time in the GNOME and KDE X.org sessions as well as the Wayland sessions; if there are any gotchas or horrible bugs, I haven't encountered them (yet). This might be a compelling reason for some folks to switch to (or stick with) Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Trying trixie&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Debian for my personal web site and blogs, but it has been quite some time since I used it as my primary desktop operating system. Debian (and Ubuntu) derivatives, such as Linux Mint and Pop!_OS, yes‚Äîbut it's been several years since I've used vanilla Debian on the desktop for more than casual tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debian release announcement boasts about the number of packages included in trixie: 64,419 packages total, with 14,100 added and more than 6,000 removed as obsolete since bookworm. That is quite a few packages, but falls short of some other distributions. For example, "dnf repoquery --repo=fedora --available" shows more than 76,000 packages available for Fedora 42.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After installing Debian, I went to install some of my preferred software, such as aerc, Ghostty, niri, and Speech Note. The aerc packages in trixie are current, but Ghostty and niri are not packaged for Debian at all. Ghostty is written in Zig, which is also not available, so users who want to build it from source will need to install Zig separately and then build Ghostty. Speech Note is packaged as a Flatpak, but Debian does not enable Flatpaks or Flathub in the GNOME Software Store by default. Users who want Flatpaks on Debian via Flathub will need to install the flatpak package and manually add the Flathub repo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \ https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users will need to add the gnome-software-plugin-flatpak package for Flatpak support in GNOME Software, and plasma-discover-backend-flatpak to add it to KDE Discover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trixie ships with the Firefox extended-support release (ESR) by default: Firefox 128, which was released in July 2024. Happily, Mozilla offers a Debian repository for those who want to run more current versions. Even better, there is a little-advertised utility called extrepo that has a curated list of external repositories users might want to enable for Debian. To enable the Mozilla repository, for example, a user only needs to install extrepo, run "extrepo enable mozilla" as root (or with sudo), update the package cache, and look for the regular Firefox package. In all, extrepo includes more than 160 external repositories for applications like Docker CE, Signal, and Syncthing. Unfortunately, the extrepo utility does not have a separate "list" command to show the available repositories, though running "extrepo search" with no search parameter will return all of its DEB822-formatted repository entries. Some of the software is in an external repository due to a non-free license, other software (like Firefox) just has a development cycle that outpaces Debian's.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As one might expect, the Debian desktop experience is not dramatically different from other distributions; GNOME 48 on Debian is little different than GNOME 48 on Fedora, and the same is true for KDE, Xfce, etc. The primary difference is that users can expect more or less the same desktop experience running Debian stable in two years that they have today, which is not necessarily true for other distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the features in Debian 13 is something that most users won't notice or appreciate at all: a transition to 64-bit time_t on 32-bit architectures, to avoid the Year 2038 problem. The short version is that 32-bit integers cannot hold a Unix epoch timestamp for dates after January 19, 2038. That may seem like a distant concern, even irrelevant for Debian trixie; after all, Debian 13 is only supported by the project until 2030. However, the project expects that some 32-bit embedded systems will still be running trixie in 2038, so Debian developers did the heavy lifting to complete the transition to 64-bit time_t now. LWN covered the early planning for this in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now, most users have retired their DSA SSH keys; if not, now is the time to do so. DSA keys were disabled by default with OpenSSH in 2015, and they are entirely disabled now with the openssh-client and openssh-server packages in trixie. If there is a device that can, for some reason, only be connected to with DSA, users can install the openssh-client-ssh1 package and use ssh1 to make the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we covered in June 2024, Debian 13 has switched to using a tmpfs filesystem for the /tmp directory. By default, Debian allocates up to 50% of memory to /tmp, but this can be changed by following the instructions in the release notes. Note that this also applies to systems that are upgraded to trixie from bookworm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Forward to forky&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian Project Leader (DPL) Andreas Tille recently announced "&lt;quote&gt;Debian's 100000th birthday&lt;/quote&gt;", so clearly the project has a bit of experience with putting out solid releases. Granted, he was reporting the number in binary, but even when converted to decimal numbers (32 years), it's an impressive track record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While testing, I installed trixie on a couple of systems, including a new Framework 12-inch laptop. My original intent was to just see whether Debian had any problems with the new hardware (it didn't), but now I'm leaning toward sticking with Debian on this system for a while to see if stability suits me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With trixie out the door, the Debian Project has already turned its attention to working on forky, which has no release date set. Debian has stuck to a loose schedule of a new stable release roughly every two years. Most likely we will see Debian 14 sometime in 2027. After the forky release, trixie will still receive updates from Debian's security team through 2028, and then from its LTS team through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of yet, there are no major new features or changes announced for forky; it seems likely that those will be coming to light in the coming months now that the project has trixie out the door. LWN will, of course, be reporting on those developments as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;

This will be enabled for you by adding that initial user to the 'sudo' group. Admittedly it's quite a wall of text. If you do leave the root password empty (and only then) is sudo installed automatically, with a config file that grants sudo access to users in the sudo group, in addition to putting the initial user in that sudo group.

I never tried it, though. Since I know my approach works, it always felt risky to try it in the other way. :) Also, I have a sudoers file that I just cp(1) into /etc/sudoers.d and it works, which is easy. (Although it is painful to install and configure sudo(8) until I actually have sudo(8).)

You can examine the patches applied to various versions here: https://sources.debian.org/patches/firefox-esr/. The new ML features postdate Firefox 128, I believe, so it's unclear right now if they'll turn those off or not. I wouldn't be surprised if they do... If you want current-ish Firefox without some of the AI-type stuff, you might check out LibreWolf or other forks.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Question: Can we improve temporal reasoning by learning better representations?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method: A novel negative sampling scheme provably enables learning temporal representations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: CRTR learns representations that enable solving Rubik's Cube without hand-crafted heuristics and improves the success rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In classical AI, perception relies on learning spatial representations, while planning‚Äîtemporal reasoning over action sequences‚Äîis typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both spatial and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure, due to reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik‚Äôs Cube. In particular, for the Rubik‚Äôs Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow solving the puzzle much faster than BestFS‚Äîthough with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of efficiently solving arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without hand-crafted search heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRTR performs well in all the evaluated domains. Success rate as a function of search budget across five domains. CRTR compared to baselines: CRL, Supervised and DeepCubeA. Results are averaged over 5 seeds; shaded regions indicate standard error. For the Rubik's Cube, both the supervised and random baselines achieve a success rate of zero for all search budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distances given by CRTR representations reflect the temporal structure well. Correlation (Spearman's œÅ) between the distance induced by learned embeddings and actual distance across the training, CRTR compared with CRL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRTR solves most tasks without requiring any search. Adding BestFS results in shorter solutions. We plot the fraction of configurations solved with a solution length of at most x, while limiting the number of nodes created to 6000. Surprisingly, on the Rubik's cube CRTR achieves a higher success rate without search, solving all board configurations within the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRTR without search exhibits a block-building-like behavior. Intermediate states from solving a randomly scrambled cube, illustrating how the algorithm gradually builds partial structure. The average solve is about 400 moves, and we see similar block building behavior across solves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I heard someone say that Bitcoin is dangerous because you could easily make a typo when entering an address, sending money to the wrong person, and have no recourse. There are dangers associated with Bitcoin, such as losing a private key, but address typos are not a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Checksums&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several kinds of Bitcoin addresses. Each is at least 20 bytes (160 bits) long, with at least 4 bytes (32 bits) of checksum. The chances of a typo resulting in a valid checksum are about 1 in 232.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Used addresses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs ignore the checksum for this section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because addresses are formed by cryptographic hash functions, we can assume the values are essentially randomly distributed in the space of possible addresses. The addresses are deterministic, but for modeling purposes, random is as random does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means a typo of an actual address is no more or less likely to be another actual address than an address typed at random. This is unlike, say, English words: a mistyped English word is more likely to be another English word than random keystrokes would be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been on the order of a billion Bitcoin addresses used, in a space of 2160 possibilities. (Actually more since some addresses have more than 160 bits.) There‚Äôs about a 1 in 1039 chance that a random 160-bit sequence corresponds to an address somewhere on the Bitcoin blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addresses close in edit distance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone with the Caesarean handle Veni Vidi Vici on X asked&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What about the odds that out of those 1B addresses, two of them are one character swap away from each other?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs an interesting question. Let‚Äôs assume the addresses are Base58-encoded strings of length 26. Addresses could be longer, but assuming the minimum length increases the probability of addresses being close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many addresses are within one or two character swaps of another? I addressed a similar question here a couple weeks ago. If all the characters were unique, the number of strings within k swaps of each other would be&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;|S1(26, 26 ‚àí k)|&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where S1 denotes Stirling numbers of the first kind. For k = 1 this would be 325 and for k = 2 this would be 50,050. This assumes all the characters are unique; I haven‚Äôt thought through the case where characters are repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For round numbers, let‚Äôs say there are a billion addresses, and for each address there are a million other addresses that are close in some sense, plausible typos of the address. That would be 1012 addresses and typos, spread out in a space of ‚âà1045 (i.e. 5826) possible addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there‚Äôs an implicit Birthday Problem here. No particular address is likely to collide with another, even when you allow typos, but what about the likelihood that some address collides?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say we partition our space of 1045 addresses into N = 1029 addresses with a million possible typos for each address. Then as a rule of thumb, you‚Äôd need around ‚àöN random draws before you have a 50-50 chance of seeing a collision. Since 109 is a lot less than 1014.5, it‚Äôs unlikely that any two addresses collide, even when you consider each address along with a million associated typos.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Meta might be secretly scanning your phone's camera roll - how to check and turn it off&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ZDNET's key takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta could be scanning your camera roll right now.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's using your photos to provide AI-powered suggestions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check Facebook settings to turn off the features.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta could be analyzing and retaining your phone's photos without your explicit consent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some Facebook users have noticed that, deep within their app settings, Meta has switched on two toggles that allow it to access their camera roll to offer AI-powered suggestions, including "personalized creative ideas, like travel highlights and collages."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? The toggles for the AI suggestion features, called "camera roll sharing suggestions," appear to be turned on for users who claim they haven't seen a pop-up from Facebook asking for permission to enable them. If you get that "cloud processing" pop-up and tap "Allow" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your "media and facial features" to be analyzed by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you, unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, to be clear, you're still giving Meta the right to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who never knowingly opted in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, unknowingly opted-in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Open the Facebook app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grab your iPhone or Android phone.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Go to the Menu &amp;gt; Settings and Privacy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon. This will take you directly to Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Select Settings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now, scroll down and look for "Camera roll sharing suggestions."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the "Camera roll sharing suggestions" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Look for the option labeled "Camera roll sharing suggestions" and tap it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Turn off both toggles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find the option labeled "Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook." If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Find the option labeled "Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing." If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where is this feature being tested?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, "We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is this a potential privacy issue?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In the Eighth Circuit, the Fight Over Sig Sauer‚Äôs P320 FMECA Goes Public&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secrecy battle over the Army‚Äôs Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer‚Äôs P320 has followed Glasscock v. Sig Sauer to the Eighth Circuit. A media intervenor is now asking the appellate court to keep key records open‚Äîand their brief places Practical Shooting Insights (this site) squarely in the middle of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What‚Äôs new&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Trace intervenes in the appeal. The newsroom moved to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing sealed filings tied to class certification and the FMECA, arguing the public‚Äôs right of access and noting the district court cited the FMECA nine times when it certified the class.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sig Sauer says ‚Äúnational security‚Äù and asks for deference to the Army. In opposing intervention, Sig Sauer urges the court to leave FMECA-related material sealed and to give the Army time to weigh in, framing the dispute in terms of protecting ‚Äúmilitary secrets.‚Äù&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A second FMECA document emerges. Sig Sauer‚Äôs opposition confirms there are two FMECA records in the class-certification exhibits: a FMECA Spreadsheet and a FMECA Memorandum‚Äîthe latter not previously described in public filings‚Äîraising fresh questions about what the memo contains and who authored it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PSI‚Äôs reporting is part of the record. The Trace‚Äôs filing tells the court the unredacted FMECA was found on CourtListener, de‚Äëobscured, and published on Practical Shooting Insights, where it ‚Äúremains available‚Äù‚Äîand it recounts Sig Sauer‚Äôs own executive discussing it on a podcast while pointing viewers to this website.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FMECA document was previously published here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Trace‚Äôs pitch: This isn‚Äôt secret anymore&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trace walks the appellate court through how the FMECA left the bottle: it was posted on this website and then widely republished; a YouTube explainer discussing it surpassed 100,000 views. The filing quotes Sig Sauer‚Äôs VP of Consumer Affairs Phil Strader being asked on the Behind the Lens podcast why the FMECA shouldn‚Äôt be public and responding, ‚ÄúNo, there‚Äôs not‚Äù (nothing to hide), while directing viewers to this website to see the document and describing its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reporting regarding Phil Strader‚Äôs interview was previously published here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many times has the unredacted FMECA been ‚Äúshared‚Äù? The filings don‚Äôt give a precise share count. What they do document is widespread republication and discussion, including the 100k‚Äëplus video and multiple re‚Äëposts mirroring the PSI copy. In other words, the genie is out of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trace also points to DoD Instruction 5230.24, the policy Sig Sauer invokes, noting it does not authorize withholding unclassified information about evaluations of performance and reliability of military equipment‚Äîand that the PSI‚Äëhosted FMECA bears no DoD distribution markings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sig Sauer‚Äôs response: Let the Army decide‚Äîand keep the lid on&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sig Sauer tells the Eighth Circuit The Trace lacks standing and that parallel briefing is already underway in the district court. Substantively, Sig Sauer leans on military‚Äësecrets concerns, requests time for the Army to opine on release, and characterizes the FMECA as controlled technical information created under the MHS contract. (The company also recounts how the spreadsheet briefly became public in another case before being pulled down.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two details in Sig Sauer‚Äôs papers matter going forward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) The ‚ÄúFMECA Memorandum.‚Äù Sig Sauer identifies the memo alongside the previously published spreadsheet. If the memo is Sig Sauer‚Äëauthored, it could reveal how the company framed the Army analysis internally‚Äîan issue directly relevant to notice, risk mitigation, and marketing claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2) Ongoing Army communications. Sig Sauer‚Äôs litigation counsel filed a declaration stating he asked the Army about the FMECA‚Äôs distribution status and that key Army decision‚Äëmakers were unavailable the week of the deadline; Sig Sauer says the Army may submit information and seeks additional time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The transparency question, distilled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is the FMECA ‚Äúnational‚Äësecurity‚Äù material? The Trace says no‚Äîand points to DoDI 5230.24‚Äôs carve‚Äëout: it does not provide authority to withhold unclassified evaluations of performance and reliability‚Äîexactly what a FMECA is. It also underscores the lack of any DoD marking on the PSI copy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Is secrecy even possible at this point? The record shows the unredacted spreadsheet is online on this website, has been reposted broadly, and has been discussed by Sig Sauer‚Äôs own executive on air‚Äîwho told listeners where to find it. One video discussing it has 100,000+ views.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters to the class action‚Äîand to owners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The district court relied on the FMECA repeatedly when certifying the Missouri class, including on notice and risk‚Äëmitigation questions‚Äîthe very issues consumers care about. Keeping the heart of that analysis under seal on appeal would blunt the public‚Äôs ability to scrutinize a product‚Äësafety fight with real‚Äëworld consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My role, plainly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practical Shooting Insights is an independent site covering the shooting‚Äësports and firearms industry. The Trace‚Äôs filing names PSI as the first publisher of the unredacted spreadsheet and quotes Strader pointing viewers here. I will continue to publish filings and analysis so readers can compare the arguments to the documents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What to watch next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) Whether the Eighth Circuit permits intervention and applies the strong presumption of public access to class‚Äëcertification records.&lt;lb/&gt; 2) If the Army weighs in‚Äîand on what basis‚Äîregarding the FMECA‚Äôs distribution status.&lt;lb/&gt; 3) Disclosure of the FMECA Memorandum. If it‚Äôs Sig Sauer-authored, it could illuminate internal framing of hazards and fixes‚Äîmaterial at the core of consumer‚Äëprotection claims.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Curious Case of Flunking My Anthropic Interview (Again)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a vague overview of what just happened:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I recently applied for Anthropic's Developer Relations role.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My friend who works there gave me a glowing recommendation (thanks again, dude!).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I completed their secret take-home assignment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On top of their secret take-home assignment, I independently published diggit.dev and a companion blogpost about my [sincerely] positive experiences with Claude. I was hoping that some unsolicited "extra credit" would make me look like an exceptional/ambitious candidate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I posted diggit.dev to HackerNews and it hit the frontpage!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I submitted my take-home assignment and my unsolicited extra credit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They sent me the "unfortunately" email.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic obviously didn't do anything wrong. I'm just bummed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code truly is one of my favorite dev tools ever, and if you've suffered through my talks/interviews, you're probably sick of my enthusiasm for software. I was particularly excited to interview with Anthropic because I respect their approach to responsible AI adoption. This very blog is too often a crazed celebration of humans, of software, of AI, of progress, of sincerity -- I, I felt like I was a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time I flunked an Anthropic interview (ca. 2022), I accidentally clicked a wrong button during their automated coding challenge. It was easy to swallow that failure. I made an honest mistake; I expect companies to reject candidates who make honest mistakes during interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is different. I didn't misclick any buttons. My best wasn't good enough. I'm not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This essay started as a fantasy: some hero at Anthropic reads this on HackerNews and vouches for me and I get the job and I help them guide humanity toward post-scarity AI abundance, forever and ever, amen. I'm ashamed of these thoughts. It's the same folly of explaining to an ex-girlfriend why she's wrong about her own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dating was difficult for me. I don't mind feeling ugly or low-status or whatever -- I know my place. But it hurts to feel seen, feel considered, but ultimately rejected due to mysterious forces: "He's cute, but he's too weird."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm weird. My eccentric habits have been an overall boon for my career, for my relationships, for my well-being. But it's moments like these when I just want to turn all my weird off. I want to be a square peg for this square hole and do honest work and feed my family and help humanity thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't turn my weird off, so I think I defensively dial it up sometimes. I exaggerate my eccentricities. It's easy to swallow criticism when it isn't the real me, when it isn't my best, when it's honest mistakes -- what a load of crap. This is me. This is my best. Hello, world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it's all coming back in waves, in gasps -- I spent so much of my life being an unlikable jerk. Becoming somebody else has been slow/painful and I'm so deeply afraid of regressing. Over the past decade, I've been striving to spread joy, to do good, to be better. I'm trying so hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And all this keyboard vomit is a promise to myself that I'm not giving up. I hate this feeling, and I'm staring these nightmares straight in their stupid eyeballs, and they're not blinking. I am still alive, and I have so much more to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm okay. I mean it. I don't need (or deserve) your sympathy. I'm so lucky to be alive, at this time, at this place, in this body, with these people. My life is great, and it will get even better if I keep putting in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spewing my insides like this onto The Internet is terrifying, but I suspect many strangers are facing similar feelings. It's rough out there. Whatever it is, wherever you are, I hope this helps. You've got this. You're not alone, and we're only human.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm pleased to announce the release of SilverBullet v2, your next open source, self hosted, and programmable notes application.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This release has fewer features than ever. Yes, you read that right. SilverBullet had accumulated a wide, but somewhat incoherent set of features over the years. V2 does away with a lot of them. These include online mode, the special query language and template languages, command links, anchors, space script, space config, attribute extractors, object decorators, live embeds, federation and probably more.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A lot of these previously ‚Äúbaked in‚Äù features have now been reimagined on the unifying foundation of Space Lua, SilverBullet‚Äôs Lua dialect.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is SilverBullet&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre new to SilverBullet, let‚Äôs back up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SilverBullet is a tool to develop, organize, and structure your personal knowledge and to make it universally accessible across all your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In SilverBullet you keep your content as a collection of markdown Pages (called a Space). You navigate your space using the Page Picker like a traditional notes app, or through Links like a wiki (except links are bi-directional).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you are the writer type, you‚Äôll appreciate SilverBullet as a clean markdown editor with Live Preview. If you have more of an outliner personality, SilverBullet has Outlining tools for you. Productivity freak? Have a look at Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More of a database person? You will appreciate Objects and Queries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And if you are comfortable (learning to) program, you will love dynamically generating content with Space Lua (SilverBullet‚Äôs Lua dialect), and use it to create custom commands and widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SilverBullet is a self-hosted web application. You need to install it on a server. Perhaps you do this on a Raspberry Pi you didn‚Äôt have a use for, or a VPS somewhere in the cloud. SilverBullet is distributed as a single self-contained server binary or Docker container. While this is a bit more complicated to set up than simply downloading a desktop or mobile app, since your space is centrally stored on a server under your control, you can now access it from anywhere you can access your server.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is a video introduction that shows you some of SilverBullet v2‚Äôs features:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What‚Äôs new&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The biggest new feature in v2 is what was removed. The removal of features put extra pressure on coming up with new ways to rebuild old functionality, which in effect meant we really doubled down on Space Lua and greatly expanded its APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Features previously built as Plugs (in TypeScript) are now slowly being rebuilt as SilverBullet Lua Libraries, and collected in silverbullet-libaries and community forums.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What was previously known as ‚Äúsync mode‚Äù is now the default and only mode in SilverBullet v2. This means that all your content is continuously kept in sync between your clients via your server, and all processing happens locally. No internet connection? No problem, you will have access to all your notes, can edit them and everything works the same as when online.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In addition, tons of minor fixes, refinements and tweaks were made.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installation&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Installation options&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Upgrading&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre a 0.x (‚Äúv1‚Äù) user, upgrading to v2 will be a breaking change due to removed features. See the dedicated page on this topic: Migrate from v1.&lt;lb/&gt; Therefore, be sure to backup before upgrading. Upgrading is as simple as following the regular installation instructions and pointing at your existing space folder.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Support SilverBullet development &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you use SilverBullet, I highly encourage you to become a Github SilverBullet sponsor. The more financial support I receive, the more time I can spend on core SilverBullet development ‚Äî see Sustainable SilverBullet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
