  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for the valuable feedback on the drafts: Chung-Ming Chien, Moritz Boehle, Richard Hladík, Eugene Kharitonov, Patrick Perez, and Tom Sláma. I’d also like to thank the rest of the Kyutai team for the the research discussions without which this article could not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of October 2025, speech LLMs suck. Many LLMs have voice interfaces, but they usually work by transcribing your speech, generating the answer in text, and using text-to-speech to read the response out loud. That’s perfectly fine in many cases (see Unmute), but it’s a wrapper, not real speech understanding. The model can’t hear the frustration in your voice and respond with empathy, it can’t emphasize important words in its answer, it cannot sense sarcasm, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, there are LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, Qwen, Moshi) that understand and generate speech natively. But in practice, they’re either not as smart, or they behave like text model wrappers. Try asking any of them “Am I speaking in a low voice or a high voice?” in a high-pitched voice, and they won’t be able to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, speech LLMs lag behind text LLMs. But why? For text, we found out a few years ago that if you take a lot of text data, a big Transformer, and a lot of GPUs, you’ll get some pretty damn good text continuation models. Why can’t we just replace text with audio and get pretty damn good speech continuation models?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a teaser, here’s what happens when you try to do that naively (warning, loud):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll have a look at why audio is harder to model than text and how we can make it easier with neural audio codecs, the de-facto standard way of getting audio into and out of LLMs. With a codec, we can turn audio into larger discrete tokens, train models to predict continuations for these tokens, and then decode those back into audio: see animation above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyutai folks have done a lot of work in this space, which is part of the reason I chose to cover this topic. We’ll start from the basics and build up all the way to Mimi, our neural audio codec. It was originally developed for Moshi and later adopted by others for their models, notably Sesame’s CSM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To tokenize text, everybody uses a technique called byte-pair encoding and rarely changes the tokenizer: OpenAI has been using the same tokenizer since GPT-4o, an ancient model if you count in LLM years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can even get decent results without tokenizing text at all, just predicting individual characters. One of the first posts that got me excited about machine learning was Andrej Karpathy’s RNN effectiveness blog post from 2015. Karpathy trains a three-layer LSTM on a single GPU and gets it to generate decent-looking code and LaTeX:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember this was ten years ago, back when we didn’t even know that attention is all we need. Now compare Karpathy’s results to a sample from WaveNet, a model DeepMind published a year later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purely acoustically, the audio sounds good, but it rarely even manages to produce a single correct English word. We can’t be too hard on WaveNet, though. The samples from Karpathy’s RNNs are only a few thousand characters long, but this 10-second audio consists of 160k audio samples, and WaveNet creates it by painstakingly predicting sample-by-sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to build models that are coherent over time scales this long, and the model also takes very long to run for so many steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So instead of running the model to predict the samples one-by-one directly, we’d like to train a model to compress the audio into a more manageable size. We could compress the audio, use an LLM to predict a continuation in the compressed representation, and then decompress the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first, let’s get a baseline model by generating audio sample by sample, like WaveNet does. The code for all of these experiments is open-source! Check it out here. I forked Andrej Karpathy’s nanoGPT repo, a simple implementation of GPT-2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text and audio are kind of the same from the perspective of the language model: it’s just tokens in, tokens out. The only thing we need to do is to quantize the continuous values of the samples into discrete buckets. Like WaveNet, we’ll use the "μ-law algorithm" to get 256 buckets. We’ll treat those as 256 possible tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s train a language model on audio tokenized like this. For the dataset, we’ll use the Libri-Light dataset, following AudioLM (with Neil Zeghidour, Eugene Kharitonov). Its train split contains 50k hours in total, but we’ll go with 1000 hours for this experiment. With this sample-by-sample tokenization, we end up with a dataset of 53 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We train a small-ish transformer of 151.28M parameters, about the size of the smallest GPT-2 variant. When we sample from the model, it makes babbling sounds (warning, loud at times!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, it goes into a “crackling mode” that it can’t seem to get out of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also trained a smaller model, which I teased at the beginning. It’s prone to generate nightmare fuel screeches (loud!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, we’re not AGI yet. It sounds speech-like, but you can’t make out a single word and the voice keeps changing. No wonder: the context size of the model is 2048, which, for 16 kHz audio, translates to 128ms, not even the length of one word. Also, these 10-second examples took 30 minutes to generate on an H100, so we’re a few orders of magnitude away from being real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s build a neural audio codec to compress the audio. The hope is that if we reduce the sampling rate 100x, the model will also become “100x more coherent”. An old idea in machine learning is to do this using an autoencoder: a model that takes an input, compresses it into a smaller “latent space”, and then tries to reconstruct the original input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our case, we’ll want an autoencoder whose latent space is quantized so that we can feed the latents into a language model and produce continuations. (You can generate continuations with unquantized latents, but it’s trickier – see the Further reading section.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bear with me, because we’ll take a detour from audio: let’s build a quantized autoencoder on images from Fashion MNIST. We’ll take a subset with the first three classes: t-shirt/top, trouser, and pullover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s train a regular autoencoder to encode the images into two-dimensional space:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each frame shows one batch of training, with some batches skipped. The little images are the autoencoder’s reconstructions for the images in the batch. I’ve added colors for the three classes (t-shirt/top=blue trousers=green, pullover=yellow), but the autoencoder doesn’t get a class as input – the space just naturally clusters by class. Let's zoom in on a few reconstructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, the reconstruction quality is not great. The images are blurry and the first two images are reconstructed to nearly the same thing. But we used a tiny network (4 fully connected layers for the encoder and decoder each) and projected into a mere two dimensions, so we can’t expect too much of our model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s quantize these embeddings using a clustering. We’ll do something like k-means: we’ll maintain a list of the positions of the cluster centers. We initialize the positions randomly. For each training batch, we look at which embeddings would go to each cluster. (We don’t modify the embeddings, we just look at the assignment). Then we’ll nudge each cluster center towards the average position of these embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, if a center is unused for a while, we teleport it to a random embedding from the batch, because otherwise it has no way to get unstuck from its current position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the reconstructions of the cluster centers getting refined over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll make the encoder and decoder themselves better at handling quantized embeddings during training, because currently, we’re just fitting the clustering on top of an autoencoder that is not “aware” it’s being quantized. We’d like the autoencoder to adapt to the quantization as we train it. Currently, we’re doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

x_reconstructed = decoder(z)

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of feeding the unquantized embedding into the decoder, we’ll first move it to the closest cluster:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

z_quantized = to_nearest_cluster(z)     # 👈
x_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)  # 👈

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a snag: if we do this, we won’t be able to train the autoencoder any more, because the quantization operation is not differentiable, meaning there is no gradient flowing from the loss to the weights of the encoder. Essentially, we’re no longer able to answer the question: “if I want the loss to decrease a bit, in which direction should I nudge the encoder’s weights?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll fix this problem by pretending it doesn’t exist. Yes, really. We’ll think of &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; moved by an arbitrary vector that doesn’t affect the gradient. That will make the gradient of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; equal to that of &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt;, which is why this is also known as the straight-through estimator of the gradient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;x = get_batch()
z = encoder(x)

residual = z - to_nearest_cluster(z)
# .detach() means "forget that this needs a gradient"
z_quantized = z - residual.detach()
x_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)

loss = reconstruction_loss(x, x_reconstructed)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the forward pass, &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt; is set to the same value as before, but importantly, the gradient of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is now equal to that of &lt;code&gt;z_quantized&lt;/code&gt; rather than just being 0 because of the non-differentiable &lt;code&gt;to_nearest_cluster(z)&lt;/code&gt; operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a price to pay for this lie. When training, the encoder’s weights will be updated to improve the reconstruction loss, but they’re updated as if the quantization didn’t happen, so they won’t move in the optimal direction. But as long as the embeddings stick close to their cluster centers, the gradient direction will still be mostly correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can actually encourage the encoder to make embeddings that are easily quantizable by adding a commitment loss: a penalty for each point based on how far it is from its cluster center. The gradient of this loss will push the points closer to their cluster centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By quantizing at training time and adding a commitment loss, it’s no longer just a clustering being fit on top of the embeddings. The model itself is trained to be good for quantization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the training dynamics look different: the commitment loss adds a certain “stiffness” that doesn’t allow the embeddings to move around as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the reconstructions look like when we use the quantized representations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how the first two images are reconstructed to exactly the same image. That’s simply because their embeddings got assigned to the same cluster and therefore quantized to the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model described here is known as a “VQ-VAE”: a vector-quantized variational autoencoder. The word “variational” here is just a vestigial leftover that doesn’t mean anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve the reconstruction fidelity, we can just increase the number of cluster centers. But keeping track of too many centers can get prohibitively expensive in terms of compute and memory required, so we’ll do a clever trick: if we want 2^20 (~1M) possible values, we won’t create 2^20 clusters directly. Instead, we’ll use two separate quantizers with 2^10=1024 clusters and combine their result. Each embedding will then be quantized to a tuple of two integers in [0..1023], yielding 2^20 possible combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, but how? Well, recall the &lt;code&gt;residual&lt;/code&gt; variable we used in the straight-through estimator, defined as &lt;code&gt;z - to_nearest_cluster(z)&lt;/code&gt; the shift from the quantized embedding to the unquantized one. It represents the part of the original vector &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; that we didn’t manage to take into account when quantizing to &lt;code&gt;to_nearest_cluster(z)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So for each embedding in the batch, we have a corresponding residual vector. The solution is obvious: we’ll quantize these residuals exactly the same way we did with the original embeddings, by training another vector quantizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, the 2D positions for a single quantizer don’t define images because we need to combine the two quantizers, so we’ll just visualize everything as dots:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each image is then represented as the index of the cluster of the embedding and that of the residual. Let’s try to reconstruct a few images with this two-level quantizer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reconstructions of the first two images are similar, but no longer the exact same: the first image is represented as (4, 3) and the second as (4, 5). In other words, they share the same token for the first level, but differ in how the residual is quantized. The differences are quite subtle, so here’s a comparison between the one-level and two-level reconstructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to emphasize that the second quantization level makes modifications to the embedding, not the output pixels directly. This can be seen by the fact that the leftmost and rightmost image are encoded as (4, 3) and (30, 3) respectively. So they have the same residual code, 3, but it modifies the two reconstructed images in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the reconstructions are still not very accurate. The upper bound on the quality is the reconstruction from unquantized embeddings, so if your autoencoder is bad (and ours is), improving the quantization won’t save you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll stop here, but a natural extension to this idea is to go beyond two levels. Just take the residuals of the two-level reconstruction and quantize those, and so on. This generalized Residual Vector Quantization algorithm looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def rvq_quantize(z):
    residual = z
    codes = []

    for level in range(levels):
        quantized, cluster_i = to_nearest_cluster(level, residual)
        residual -= quantized
        codes.append(cluster_i)

    return codes
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residual vector quantization was first applied to neural audio codecs in SoundStream, but the idea has been around since the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applying RVQ to audio is fairly straightforward. As our autoencoder, we’ll use a convolutional neural network (CNN) similar to what Jukebox uses. The details of the architecture aren’t too important here. What’s important is that it’s a network that takes an audio with t samples and converts it to a vector of shape (t/128, 32). In other words, it downsamples by a factor of 128 and gives us 32-dimensional float representations. The decoder then takes the (t/128, 32) embeddings and decodes them back into t samples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;audio = get_batch()               # shape: [B, T]
z = encoder(audio)                # shape: [B, T/128, 32]
audio_reconstructed = decoder(z)  # shape: [B, T]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As before, we’ll add an RVQ after the encoder. The only difference from the image case is that for each audio sample, we have t/128 embedding vectors, not just a single one as we did for images. We just quantize these independently (even though the encoder “sees” more audio than what corresponds to that one vector). During training, we also have a batch dimension, so our model now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;audio = get_batch()                         # [B, T]
z = encoder(audio)                          # [B, T/128, 32]

# Combine the batch and time dimensions
z = rearrange(                              # [B*T/128, 32]
    z, "b t_emb d -&amp;gt; (b t_emb) d"
)

codes = rvq_quantize(z)           # integers, [B*T/128, levels]
z_quantized = codes_to_embeddings(codes)    # [B*T/128, 32]
z_quantized = rearrange(                    # [B, T/128, 32]
    z_quantized, "(b t_emb) d -&amp;gt; b t_emb d"
)

audio_reconstructed = decoder(z_quantized)  # [B, T]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last missing piece before we can train our first neural audio codec is a loss function. There’s a whole rabbit hole we could go into about which one to choose, but we’ll avoid it and just use a very simple one. We’ll compute the log amplitude spectrogram of the original and reconstructed audio, and take their difference. The loss is the mean square of this difference between spectrograms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it harder for the model to overfit to this loss, we take the spectrogram with three different parameters for the short-time Fourier transform, and let our loss be the mean between the three sub-losses. This is called the multi-scale spectral loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s train some codecs! We’ll look at how varying the number of RVQ levels affects the reconstruction quality. As we expected, increasing the number of levels helps, decreasing the spectral loss:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s hear what the codecs sound like. We’ll use the three codecs to reconstruct this audio from the Expresso dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the reconstructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the audio gets better as we add more RVQ levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with 16 levels, there is some crackling, the audio sounds muffled, and there is a constant high-pitched noise. Later we’ll discuss how we could improve the codec further, but for demonstration purposes, this will do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have a neural audio codec: we can turn audio into LLM-friendly tokens and back. Codec just means a tokenizer for audio, but we say codec because that’s the term used for classic compression like MP3. I’ll be using codec and tokenizer interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s come back to what we wanted to do in the first place: modeling audio. Specifically, we’ll make a model that can take an audio prefix and generate a plausible continuation for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as a reminder, we want to train good audio LLMs so that we have models that understand and produce speech natively, understanding emotion, emphasis, and so on. They could also be fine-tuned into text-to-speech, speech-to-text, or translation models, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now that you’re convinced that audio LLMs are the path to AGI, let’s train a few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our dataset, we’ll use Libri-Light, like we did for our sample-by-sample model earlier. This time we’ll use 10000h of audio instead of 1000h. It’s a dataset of public-domain audiobooks, so if we have a good model for it, maybe we’ll be able to generate more stories. (Don’t get your hopes up too much.) All we need to do is to convert the audio dataset into a sequence of discrete tokens so that we can feed it into an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll do that using our 8-level RVQ codec. From an audio with t samples, we’ll get an array of tokens of shape (t/128, 8). But now there’s an issue: how to deal with the fact that for each time step, there’s not one but eight tokens? This is not a problem we have to deal with in text LLMs, where we have a single sequence of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll do the simplest thing possible and just flatten the array into 1D of shape (t/128 * 8), and have our LLM predict the eight levels in separate time steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big disadvantage is that we lose some of our temporal compression. We downsampled the audio 128x, but now we’re inflating it 8x again by flattening the levels. That makes inference less efficient, and possibly worse quality because the effective context size decreases. We'll be using the 8 RVQ codec rather than the 16 RVQ one to avoid making the compression even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also predict all RVQ levels for a single step at once (”parallel pattern”), but it also makes things harder for the model because it has to decide on all levels at once. There are a bunch of other schemes people have tried to balance compression and quality. Here are a few tried out in MusicGen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, as of 2025, there is no single solution that “won”: every paper does something different, and the schemes can get quite involved. Just look at this diagram from MiMo-Audio, a model released in September 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to finally train a codec-wrapped language model! As I’ve mentioned, our code is based on Andrej Karpathy’s nanoGPT codebase for training text LLMs. We just need to modify it to accept audio as input. But that’s easy, because LLMs don’t care about what kind of tokens you’re feeding in – it’s all just numbers. Once we’ve tokenized the dataset and flattened it into a 1D sequence, we’re good to go. Tokenized this way, our 10000 hours of audio take up 134 GB. For comparison, storing this much data as uncompressed audio would take over 1 TB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re going to use the exact same model architecture and hyperparameters as for the sample-by-sample model: the only difference is in the tokenization. We also have a 10x bigger dataset, but the sample-by-sample model can’t even fit the dataset with 1k hours, so more data wouldn’t save it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I trained the model on 8 H100s for about 5 days. To get some samples, I decided to prompt the model with a sample of Libri-Light reading of two lines from Michael Field’s poem July. (As I learned when working on this, Michael Field is a pen name of Katherine Harris and Edith Emma Cooper.) Let’s see what kind of poetry we can get from our model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some signs of life, but we don’t have a poet yet. It sounds like somebody speaking behind a curtain. You can’t really make out what it’s saying, but the intonation is there: it sounds like somebody reading from a book, which is indeed what the model was trained on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also maintains a coherent voice, until it decides for the last few seconds to switch to a different one. That is also consistent with the data: we sample the training data from a concatenation of all the audiobooks chopped up into segments and mixed together, so the model does encounter boundaries between different speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our codec was deliberately simplistic, which explains why the results aren't great—but there's been a good amount of research on neural audio codecs in the last four years that we could leverage. We won’t implement all the improvements here, but instead we’ll look at what happens when we use Mimi as the tokenizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mimi is a modern neural audio codec built here at Kyutai for Moshi, our audio language model. It’s since been used as the tokenizer for other models as well, like Sesame CSM, VoXtream, and LFM2-Audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Mimi sounds a lot better than the homemade codec we trained earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of the multi-scale spectral loss, Mimi uses an adversarial loss, like a GAN. There’s a discriminator network that tries to classify audios as being original or reconstructed by the codec, and the goal of the codec is to fool this discriminator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another improvement Mimi adds is using RVQ dropout: it uses 32 RVQ levels but during training, the reconstruction is sometimes randomly truncated to a lower number of levels. That allows us to run Mimi for a lower number of RVQ levels at inference time and still get decent results, because it doesn’t rely on all levels being present. For our codec, we had to train separately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s hear our example audio reconstructed with Mimi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our purposes, a variant with fewer levels might have the advantage of being easier to model because it’s more compressed. Let’s train models with 8- and 32-level Mimi and compare the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I trained the exact same model architecture as before, the only thing that changes is the tokenizer. It’s 10k hours from Libri-Light as the dataset, just like when we used our simple codec. Mimi has a sample rate of 24 kHz but Libri-Light uses 16 kHz, which puts a cap on how good it can sound, since we lose the higher frequencies of the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mimi downsamples the audio a lot more aggressively, too: its sample rate is 12.5 frames per second, whereas we used 125 frames per second for our codec – 10x higher! This means the dataset is also smaller on disk. With our codec, it took 134 GB, but for Mimi it’s “just” 54 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a poem generated with the model trained on Mimi-tokenized data. I prompted it with two lines from the poem, as before:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is my best attempt at a transcription:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;And corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;Illness worried in the fur&lt;lb/&gt;this and pelan in stones&lt;lb/&gt;during the turan’s ciscerey&lt;lb/&gt;headforths nepet Paul Twain.&lt;lb/&gt;He sees zin in them.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tad too surrealist for my taste, but maybe Lewis Carroll would like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make: I lied to you just now. But just a bit, and for didactic purposes. In fact, the model above was trained on audio from a 31-level Mimi, where I omitted the very first level, which contains the “semantic token”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of this token is to represent semantic information of the audio, without necessarily aiding reconstruction. I won’t go into how these work, but in one sentence, Mimi’s semantic tokens are distilled from WavLM, which you can think of as a BERT for speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get a feeling for what information semantic tokens encode, let’s take this example audio, passed through Mimi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s train a language model trained on the full Mimi, including semantic tokens. We’re going to run the model in a way where we keep the semantic tokens from the original audio but we discard the others, and let the model predict them. That means the information from the semantic tokens is fixed (”teacher-forced”), but the model is free to decide the others according to what continuations it finds plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen to two different reconstructions we obtain this way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The voice is completely different, but it’s saying the same thing! This means the semantic tokens encode what the person is saying, but are invariant to the voice. That’s useful because it helps the model focus on what to say, not how to say it. In that regard, they’re closer to text tokens, which also don’t contain information about the voice, intonation, timing, or emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s take the model trained on semantic Mimi and ask it to complete the poem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;and corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;from the man was nothing moan.&lt;lb/&gt;The low death and heart&lt;lb/&gt;She came fyde wood.&lt;lb/&gt;A finteriest, a fall,&lt;lb/&gt;all them.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It still makes up words and the sentences are not too coherent, but clearly, the proportion of real words is much higher; the model is “more semantic”. The acoustic quality is the same, which is what we’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s listen to a second poem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;and corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;hope won and she&lt;lb/&gt;who is just a night in Tatan&lt;lb/&gt;in doe ock-ohm?&lt;lb/&gt;the whom?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the whom?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can sacrifice some acoustic quality to improve the semantics by reducing the number of RVQ levels. Let’s do 8. That way, we get higher audio compression, and a proportionally higher part of the loss comes from the semantic token, since now it’s 1/8 tokens and not just 1/32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed about this model is that it learned to memorize the Librivox notice, so it sometimes generates things like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 6 of The Founday, by R. Auclair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This is a Librivox recording. All Librivox recordings are in the public domain. For information, or to volunteer, please visit librivox.org.&lt;lb/&gt;Reading by: Kelvert&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeating the training data is generally not what you want, but in our case it’s a great sign of life, because the previous models couldn’t even manage that. It also makes up the book, author, and reader, so there is still novelty here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s try to make some more poetry:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When grass is gone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;and corn still grassy;&lt;lb/&gt;When so we could say&lt;lb/&gt;that in fairy interesting wife&lt;lb/&gt;who lay there and gone&lt;lb/&gt;that save the rosy light of life&lt;lb/&gt;Jay Dien, the antique mollity&lt;lb/&gt;and a mollity the beast of gray failed summon&lt;p&gt;end of poem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recording is in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[different voice]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;So we have formed a float that sent in would rattle down. The piece of opportunity reading and assimila—&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great. There are several signs of the model being better than the previous ones. I love that it makes up the word “mollity” and then repeats it in the next line. Also, it realizes that it’s reciting a poem and ends the section with “end of poem”. Then it decides it’s the end of the chapter/section and it ends with the “This recording is in the public domain.” disclaimer. After that, it changes the voice and continues talking. That makes sense, since the clips from various audiobooks are just shuffled and concatenated during training, so here the model simulated a clip boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We might get even better results by weighing the loss of the semantic tokens higher than the acoustic tokens, to make the model focus more on the meaning than the sound – in fact, Moshi uses a semantic loss factor of 100x! But we have to stop somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve managed to use neural audio codecs to make an audio language model that generates somewhat coherent speech. Obviously, that’s not where the state of the art is in 2025 (and we’re not trying to reach it here) but keep in mind that by using the exact same model without neural audio codecs gives us this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, still a long way to go to match text models! Currently, there seems to be a trade-off between speech understanding and reasoning abilities. At the beginning, I mentioned that the speech-native models (Gemini, ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, Qwen, Moshi) aren’t able to tell you whether you’re speaking in a high or low voice, despite the fact that they’re trained to natively understand audio. This is likely because they’re trained on a lot of data generated synthetically with text-to-speech and/or because understanding the tone of the voice (apparently) doesn’t help the models make more accurate predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyutai took a stab at creating a voice chat based on an audio language model with Moshi (demo, paper), released in July 2024. Moshi might not be the AI you’d pick to do your homework for you, but cut it some slack: it was the first end-to-end voice AI, released even before OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moshi models an “inner monologue” text stream in parallel with audio streams for itself and the user. The text stream is helps it plan what it’s going to say, and ablations showed that the text stream helps the model massively. At the same time, it’s a bit sad: most of the reasoning seems to be delegated to the text stream and the audio streams are just there to provide an integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just Moshi: as the “am I speaking in a high voice” experiment shows, this over-reliance on text in favor of audio is an issue for all audio LLMs. And that’s even though the dominant modeling approach is somewhat different than Moshi’s: interleaving text and audio tokens instead of modeling them in parallel streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over a year after Moshi, audio models still lag behind text LLMs. But why? To me, this mysterious unsolved “modality gap” makes audio ML an exciting field to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA may sideline SpaceX and choose a different company to land its astronauts on the moon later this decade, acting space agency chief Sean Duffy suggested during TV appearances Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duffy emphasized that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon’s surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA’s efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They push their timelines out, and we’re in a race against China,” Duffy told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday morning, referring to SpaceX’s development of Starship — the vehicle the company plans to use as a lunar lander for NASA. “So, I’m going to open up the contract. I’m going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If NASA were to cancel or amend its contract with SpaceX, it could signal a remarkable reversal of a plan the space agency has had in place since 2021. That’s when NASA chose Starship — which is still in the early stages of development and has racked up three in-flight failures and a couple successful suborbital test flights so far in 2025 — to serve as lunar lander during the historic moon landing mission, called Artemis III.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duffy’s remarks on Monday come as that 2021 decision is facing new scrutiny from space industry leaders who are concerned that the logistics involved with using SpaceX’s Starship are too complex and may cause NASA to lose the new moon race, as CNN previously reported. The Artemis III moon-landing mission is currently set to take place as soon as mid-2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on Duffy’s remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What could happen next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exact timeline for NASA to potentially alter its deal with SpaceX or bring on a new contractor was not immediately clear. In a separate interview on Monday with Fox News’ “Fox &amp;amp; Friends,” Duffy said he’s “in the process of opening that contract up,” referring to the Artemis lunar lander agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA already has two different companies contracted to provide lunar landers: SpaceX with its Starship vehicle, and Blue Origin, the space venture founded by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, which is developing a lander called Blue Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is Starship, however, that is slated to fly the Artemis III mission in 2027, which would mark the first time astronauts have set foot on the lunar surface since the Apollo program concluded five decades ago. (Blue Origin, which received its NASA contract in 2023, is looking to use Blue Moon to complete Artemis missions later in the program, such as Artemis V.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens said that the space agency gave SpaceX and Blue Origin until October 29 to present “acceleration approaches” for lunar lander development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“NASA is also going to request plans from the entire commercial space industry - through an RFI (or Request for Information) - for how NASA can increase the cadence of our mission to the Moon,” the statement reads. “President Trump and Secretary Duffy have a mission to beat China back to the Moon. That’s why they are harnessing the power of the American space industry and seeking solutions to develop more ways to land on the Moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timeline of Artemis III has been the focus of hawkish lawmakers concerned that the landing will not occur before taikonauts — or Chinese astronauts — reach the moon. China has said it will accomplish that feat by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his remarks to CNBC, Duffy suggested it could be Blue Origin that takes over SpaceX’s position in the Artemis III mission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to CNN’s request for comment regarding Duffy’s remarks, Blue Origin said only that it is “ready to support.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Duffy also warned that NASA may opt to open up the competition more broadly to providers that do not yet have contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If SpaceX is behind, but Blue Origin can do it before them, good on Blue Origin,” Duffy said. “But … we’re not going to wait for one company. We’re going to push this forward and win the second space race against the Chinese.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if NASA’s plans to issue a RFI will result in any new companies securing contracts. In government contracting parlance, RFIs are typically considered part of an informal fact-finding process whereas Requests for Proposals, or RFPs, are a more formal solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space industry experts have expressed concerns about the timelines for both SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s Blue Moon, noting that the vehicles are complex and may need to be refueled in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In-orbit refueling has never been attempted, the experts noted, and lunar landers requiring such a step could require prohibitively long development timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what other US companies may be in a position to join SpaceX and Blue Origin in competing for NASA Artemis contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynetics, an aerospace company based in Alabama, was among the companies that originally bid for a lunar lander contract alongside Blue Origin and SpaceX. Dynetics did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to the control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges' g&amp;gt;0.3) on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain Of Thoughts drops 74.9 → 57.2 and RULER-CWE 84.4 → 52.3 as junk ratio rises from 0% to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error forensics reveal several key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for continual pretraining as a training-time safety problem and motivating routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Brain rot” burst into public discourse as a shorthand for how endless, low-effort, engagement-bait content can dull human cognition—eroding focus, memory discipline, and social judgment through compulsive online consumption. If large language models learn from the same internet firehose, the question becomes unavoidable: what happens when we keep feeding models the digital equivalent of junk food? Studying “Brain Rot” for LLMs isn’t just a catchy metaphor—it reframes data curation as cognitive hygiene for AI, guiding how we source, filter, and maintain training corpora so deployed systems stay sharp, reliable, and aligned over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distinct from prior work that primarily focuses on data quality for training LLMs, we aim to provide a new view on data quality - the extent to which content is trivial and easy to consume for humans in social media. The properties, conceptualized via tweet shortness/popularity or content semantics, are not intuitively related to the cognitive capabilities that we expect LLMs to master in learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intervention Method: The core idea was to simulate how an LLM's “mind” changes when fed different information diets. (1) We used continual pre-training as the main intervention — exposing models to either junk or clean data for a sustained period, just as humans continually absorb online content. (2) Afterward, every model went through the same instruction tuning step to ensure format consistency and eliminate task-specific bias.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Receipe: To operationalize the idea of “junk,” we built two complementary metrics for selecting data from real Twitter/X posts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring Cognitive Function: We leverage existing benchmarks to examine the multifaceted ``cognitive functions'' of LLMs. The benchmarks cover different capabilities that were hypothesized to be affected by the junk-data intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Psychometrically validated small human questionnaires to assess personality-like tendencies.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We analyze intervention effects by comparing benchmark differences after feeding junk/control data to four LLMs. The difference is measured by Hedges' g across 4 LLMs. In the above figure, both M1 and M2 produce non-trivial effects (Hedges' g &amp;gt; 0.3) on reasoning and long-context capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the remaining benchmarks the two interventions diverge, implying that engagement degree (M1) is not a proxy for semantic quality (M2) but represents a distinct dimension of data quality.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In dose-response testing, M1 engagement intervention demonstrates more significant and progressive impacts on reasoning and long-context capabilities than M2 intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We analyze the reasoning failures in ARC-Challenge to identify different failure modes. We find that the majority failures can be attributed to "thought skipping" (e.g., the model fails to generate intermediate reasoning steps), which significantly increases in models affected by brain rot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the cognitive decline associated with brain rot is not easily mitigated by standard fine-tuning techniques. Even after extensive instruction tuning (IT) or post-doc continual pre-training on high-quality control data, the models exhibit lingering effects of the junk data they were initially exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduced and empirically validated the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis, demonstrating that continual exposure to junk data—defined as engaging (fragmentary and popular) or semantically low-quality (sensationalist) content—induces systematic cognitive decline in large language models. The decline includes worse reasoning, poorer long-context understanding, diminished ethical norms, and emergent socially undesirable personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fine-grained analysis shows that the damage is multifaceted in changing the reasoning patterns and is persistent against large-scale post-hoc tuning. These results call for a re-examination of current data collection from the Internet and continual pre-training practices. As LLMs scale and ingest ever-larger corpora of web data, careful curation and quality control will be essential to prevent cumulative harms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Gypsy Life of Robert Louis Stevenson&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—Robert Louis Stevenson, Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With time people become the stories we tell about them. Then, except in the rarest cases, oblivion. Time whittled Sappho down to fragments. Others have not survived at all. If we take the cosmic view, no one will.&lt;lb/&gt; So what is biography for? What good is its effort to demystify the secretive recesses of human character? The biographer Hermione Lee has said, “I want to penetrate those secret places, find out everything, and be completely ruthless. It’s paradoxical—I wouldn’t want it done to me, yet I’m very keen to do it to other people. And the thing that attracts me to these people is their secret self.” The biographer’s interest is the same as the novelist’s. Both are storytellers. Both deal in facts. And as we know, sometimes facts are make-believe. Sometimes fiction is truer than nonfiction. Novels used to be called histories or lives. Stories are everywhere.&lt;lb/&gt; Another expert biographer, Richard Holmes, has said, “You spend a lot of time alone with your subject, but in the end you must go out and engage your readers. Readers must be able to imagine this other life as vividly as possible and understand it as personally as possible. I think it has to be an affectionate understanding, too. At least, I find that. I’ve never written about someone I didn’t learn to like, and even to love. I call it ‘a handshake across time.’”&lt;lb/&gt; The best biographers make happy readers of us, involving us—like novelists, historians, playwrights and poets—in lives other than our own. They enlarge experience. Leo Damrosch’s new biography of Robert Louis Stevenson, Storyteller, is a splendid affair because Damrosch writes out of love, not uncritically, and not only for his subject, but also for the grand literary conversation of which he is a part.[1] Author of highly regarded books on Rousseau, Casanova, Jonathan Swift, and the circle of Samuel Johnson, Damrosch is the kind of scholar who knows a character when he sees one. He gets stories and the connections they afford us. Stevenson proves a perfect subject for him—eccentric, vital, adventurous, and, with good reason, beloved. Storyteller is thoroughly researched and copiously illustrated, but more than that, it is deeply moving in its shape and detail. It is not only about one marvelous man, whom many of us wish we could have known, but also about a great marriage, illuminating friendships and the freedom-seeking literary life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; I’ll begin at the end.&lt;lb/&gt; In some ways, Stevenson resembles D. H. Lawrence—a rebel with a conservative streak, a world traveler, an invalid (possibly consumptive), who married a strong older woman and died, like Lawrence, at 44. He wrote with what Italo Calvino called a “marvelous lightness” in multiple genres—several wonderful novels and stories, dozens of superb essays, and letters that, in unexpurgated form, deserve comparison to Byron’s for their vigorous wit. While not among our greatest poets, Stevenson wrote some indelible verses. His “Requiem,” to be found on his tomb in Samoa as well as in books, is one of the best epitaphs we have in English. He actually wrote it during a serious illness in San Francisco, but friends and family made proper use of it after his death:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the wide and starry sky,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Dig the grave and let me lie.&lt;lb/&gt;Glad did I live and gladly die,&lt;lb/&gt;And I laid me down with a will.&lt;lb/&gt;This be the verse you grave for me:&lt;lb/&gt;Here he lies where he longed to be;&lt;lb/&gt;Home is the sailor, home from the sea,&lt;lb/&gt;And the hunter home from the hill.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never mind the use Philip Larkin made of one of its lines for “This Be the Verse.” Damrosch’s placement of “Requiem” in his penultimate chapter is narrative perfection. Maybe it’s the natural shape of Stevenson’s life, or maybe it’s Damrosch’s enthusiasm for his subject, but this is a dream biography.&lt;lb/&gt; Many pages of Storyteller take up Stevenson’s frailty, his scrawniness, bouts of lung trouble and travels in search of a cure. He and his wife, Fanny, built a sprawling mansion in Samoa, which they called Vailima. There he enjoyed a few final years of robust health. It wasn’t TB that killed him, but a stroke—he had always loved tobacco and whisky. Damrosch quotes an account written by Stevenson’s stepdaughter, Belle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems he had been looking on watching my mother making a salad, and was dropping the oil for her with a perfectly steady hand. He suddenly said, “What is that?” or “What a pain!” and put both hands to his head. “Do I look strange?” he asked, and then he reeled and fell backwards. His favourite boy Sosimo [a Samoan servant] caught him and carried him into the big room, and he never was conscious after.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They had been in Samoa for just over four years,” Damrosch remarks, “—the longest Louis ever lived in one place during his entire adult life.”&lt;lb/&gt; Samoan people genuinely honored Stevenson, calling him Tusitala, or “storyteller.” During a period of civil strife on the island, a taboo had been declared against doing any harm to Vailima and its inhabitants, even though Louis (as he was familiarly called) sided with one chieftain over the others. Having been a socialist when young—about the time he renounced the Scottish Calvinism he was raised with—he had become a skeptic about political causes. Samoa changed that by showing him the dark side of Western imperialism, and in A Footnote to History (1892) he wrote passionately for the cause of independence. The chief Stevenson had favored, Mata’afa, lost in the civil war and was banished (at least he wasn’t beheaded like some of his cohort). Another chief stood at Stevenson’s funeral to deliver a eulogy: “When Mata’afa was taken, who was our support but Tusitala? We were in prison, and he cared for us. We were sick, and he made us well. We were hungry, and he fed us. The day was no longer than his kindness. You are great people and full of love. Yet who among you is so great as Tusitala? What is your love to his love?”&lt;lb/&gt; In a few photographs we can see the burning energy and spirit in Stevenson’s eyes. His conversation won him fervent friends, some of whom fell out with him over time. None of the friends in Damrosch’s account moves me more than Henry James, who loved Louis and Fanny Stevenson from the moment he met them in London. When other friends complained about Stevenson leaving home and setting sail for the Pacific islands, James defended him, though he missed Louis terribly. James’s letters to Fanny after Louis’s death move me right down to the ground:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To “my dear Fanny Stevenson” James sent a long and tender letter of sympathy, beginning with “What can I say to you that will not seem cruelly irrelevant and vain?” After praising her “courage and patience and fortitude,” which would be much needed, he went on to say, “To have lived in the light of that splendid life, that beautiful, bountiful being—only to see it, from one moment to the other, converted into a fable as strange and romantic as one of his own, a thing that has been and has ended, is an anguish into which no one can enter with you fully, and of which no one can drain the cup for you. You are nearest to the pain, because you were nearest the joy and the pride.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;James went on, and I simply must quote it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;He has gone in time not to be old—early enough to have been so generously young and late enough to have drunk deep of the cup. There have been—I think—for men of letters few deaths more romantically right. Forgive me, I beg you, what may sound cold-blooded in such words—and as if I imagined there could be anything for you “right” in the rupture of such an affection and the loss of such a presence. I have in my mind, in that view, only the rounded career and the consecrated work. When I think of your own situation I fall into a mere confusion of pity and wonder—with the sole sense of your being as brave a spirit as he was (all of whose bravery you endlessly shared) to hold on by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may wonder that I have begun my review with this postmortem. I dwell on it not only because it touched me more than I have been touched by a biography in many years, but because Damrosch earns my tears. I should turn next to two crucial aspects of Stevenson’s life: the quality of his writing and the extraordinary woman he married, who made him a better writer and gave him his happiest years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; My ancestors were Scottish, and Robert Louis Stevenson was an honored name in our household. I remember our illustrated edition of A Child’s Garden of Verses (1885), of which Henry James had written, “A child might have written it if a child could see childhood from the outside.” But in poems like “Rain” and “My Shadow,” Stevenson writes from the inside of childhood, at his best when he avoids moralizing. Damrosch quotes the famous couplet called “Happy Thought,” which a lesser critic would find sentimental: “The world is so full of a number of things, / I’m sure we should all be as happy as kings.” Damrosch sees that the poem is not sentimental at all: “Astonished by the richness of the world, a child is amazed that people are not happy.” In our time, astonishment and awe are among the things people who think themselves sophisticated will sneer at. They are idiots, already pickled in their opinions. Damrosch understands his subject’s generous sympathy, the way he captures “what it’s like to be small.”&lt;lb/&gt; I have never forgotten “The Land of Counterpane,” even though I had no idea what a counterpane was, and of course “The Land of Nod”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From breakfast on through all the day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;At home among my friends I stay;&lt;lb/&gt;But every night I go abroad&lt;lb/&gt;Afar into the land of Nod.&lt;lb/&gt;All by myself I have to go,&lt;lb/&gt;With none to tell me what to do—&lt;lb/&gt;All alone beside the streams&lt;lb/&gt;And up the mountain-sides of dreams.&lt;lb/&gt;The strangest things are there for me,&lt;lb/&gt;Both things to eat and things to see,&lt;lb/&gt;And many frightening sights abroad&lt;lb/&gt;Till morning in the land of Nod.&lt;lb/&gt;Try as I like to find the way,&lt;lb/&gt;I never can get back by day,&lt;lb/&gt;Nor can remember plain and clear&lt;lb/&gt;The curious music that I hear.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the same way, I remember my early childhood encounter with a dramatic recording of Treasure Island (1883), in which the deaths of Billy Bones and Old Pew scared the bejesus out of me. I found stalwart adulthood in Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey but, like everyone else, was most beguiled by Long John Silver and his parrot, Captain Flint. Any boy of my generation would have wanted to be Jim Hawkins. In a late poem, “In the Attic,” Seamus Heaney seems to have felt the same:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I age and blank on names,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;As my uncertainty on stairs&lt;lb/&gt;Is more and more the lightheadedness&lt;lb/&gt;Of a cabin boy’s first time on the rigging,&lt;lb/&gt;As the memorable bottoms out&lt;lb/&gt;Into the irretrievable,&lt;lb/&gt;It’s not that I can’t imagine still&lt;lb/&gt;That slight untoward rupture and world-tilt&lt;lb/&gt;As a wind freshened and the anchor weighed.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just weeks ago, I re-read Treasure Island in a cheap paperback with a cheesy cartoon for a cover and was transported once again by its perfect plotting and the lucid exactitude of its prose: an island snake hisses “with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top,” and tropical foliage has “a kind of poisonous brightness.” Call it a children’s book or a young adult novel or what you will, it’s bloody great—and pretty bloody, too. When Stevenson met Mark Twain in New York, the two must have wondered at having found their biggest success writing for young people, but both excelled at conveying the violence that makes our moral choices important and difficult. They understood what it means to grow.&lt;lb/&gt; Treasure Island and Kidnapped (1886) are probably two of the most influential novels on my own life. I’ve never read Catriona (1893), the sequel to Kidnapped, which Damrosch praises on its literary merits, nor have I read The Master of Ballantrae (1889) or the important and unfinished final novel, Weir of Hermiston (1896). Based on Damrosch’s critical overviews, I should make time for them.&lt;lb/&gt; The adventure story and the historical romance were two genres at which Stevenson excelled, but he was also brilliant at the macabre psychological parable in his novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and the supernatural in his short story “Thrawn Janet” (1881). The first of these takes on the very “fortress of identity” (in Jekyll’s words) that has so obsessed us of late but turns it into something timeless. Damrosch tells us that the novella caused a furious argument between Stevenson and his wife, in which she comes off better than he does. When Louis read aloud his first draft, as Fanny’s son Lloyd recalled, “Her praise was constrained; the words seemed to come with difficulty; and then all at once she broke out with criticism. He had missed the point, she said; had missed the allegory; had made it merely a story—a magnificent bit of sensationalism—when it should have been a masterpiece.” Damrosch continues, “Fanny’s point was that Louis had ruined the story by turning it into a mere tale about a secret life. . . . What was needed was not just a character wearing a disguise, but something far more profound: a character struggling with a deeper hidden self that breaks loose and fights for supremacy.” Louis resisted, then came around, went back to work, and gave her the masterpiece she wanted. Thereafter, he jokingly referred to her as “the critic on the hearth.”&lt;lb/&gt; A friend reminds me of novels like The Wrong Box (1889), one of several Stevenson wrote in collaboration with his stepson, Lloyd. I remember an enjoyable movie but haven’t read the book. It’s the short stories I’ve dwelt in lately, including “The Body Snatcher” and “A Lodging for the Night,” a brilliant tale of the medieval French poet François Villon. Stevenson never idealizes his protagonist: “The poet was a rag of a man, dark, little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and thin black locks. He carried his four-and-twenty years with feverish animation. Greed had made folds about his eyes, evil smiles had puckered his mouth. The wolf and pig struggled together in his face. It was an eloquent, sharp, ugly, earthy countenance.” The style is kinetic, giving us action rather than explanation. You can learn from him. It was not until late in Stevenson’s short life that he felt free to write about women and sexual attraction, but within the Victorian mores of the time, he produced work charged with dark human energy, wildness and suspense that made so many of his tales excellent fodder for the movies.&lt;lb/&gt; Like Lawrence, he was also a pioneering travel writer, starting with his early books about France, An Inland Voyage (1878) and Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes (1879). The second of these is a small classic, an inspiration to nearly every travel writer since. It also inspired Richard Holmes, who undertook to follow the same journey as a way of empathizing with Stevenson the Francophile and wrote about it years later in Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer (1985). In his Paris Review interview, Holmes remembers “working out that for his Travels, Stevenson had this wonderful smell of wet Scottish tweed, French tobacco, and warm brandy. Because it always rained up there, he always rolled his own cigarettes, and he always carried a large flask of Cognac in his pocket. And then of course there was the smell of his donkey, Modestine.” Holmes practiced a peripatetic method of which Stevenson would have approved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny Stevenson was the kind of woman most people found fascinating—beautiful and brainy and brave. You can test your feelings about people in this biography by how they respond to her. Some, including Alice James, found her skin too dusky and her manners vulgar—like Louis, she rolled her own cigarettes. Down with Alice, says I. The writer Edmund Gosse described Fanny as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;She was one of the strangest people who have lived in our time, a sort of savage nature in some ways, but very lovable—extraordinarily passionate, and unlike everyone else in her violent feelings and unrestrained ways of expressing them—full of gaiety, and with a genius for expressing things picturesquely. . . . I think R.L.S. must have caught some of his ways of feeling from her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gosse would, according to Damrosch, come “to resent what he saw as Fanny’s power over Louis, but still he admired her.”&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny was ten years older than Louis. They became lovers long before she secured a divorce from her philandering husband, Sam Osbourne. Louis’s sexual experiences had begun early in his life as an Edinburgh student, so by the time he met Fanny in Bohemian circles in France, they were both pretty well liberated from social mores, interested in living as artistic gypsies. Her daughter, Belle, would write that “Louis brought into our lives a sort of joyousness hard to describe.” For his part, Stevenson fell fiercely in love with Fanny’s cool-headed humor. Belle again: “Fanny Osbourne’s voice was low in tone, and she spoke with very little modulation. Louis described it as sounding like ‘water running under ice.’”&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny hesitated, returning to her husband more than once out of love for him and concern for their children, one of whom had died young. Finally, Sam’s infidelity became too much, and Louis’s persistence won through. The couple married in San Francisco in 1880. He was thirty, she forty. Louis had been so ill with lung disease that neither believed he would live much longer. Yet Belle later recalled passing in a hallway outside their bedroom “and stopping suddenly at a light joyous sound. With a catch at my heart, I realized it was the first time I had ever heard my mother laugh.” Damrosch concludes,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More than any of Louis’s biographers, Richard Holmes does justice to this remarkable union. “When one considers other Victorian literary marriages—Hardy’s, say, or Dickens’s—Stevenson’s is something phenomenal, dynamic, explosive. It contained energies, tempests, fireworks, and sheer anarchic excitement that would have obliterated any conventional household. To find anything like his relationship with Fanny—and the comparison is significant in the largest way—one would have to look forward to Lawrence and Frieda.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a kind of person who despises enthusiasm, or fears it, and cannot abide happiness in others. I have seen this. The same sort of person looks at a Cassandra and does not believe a word she says. Fanny was a Cassandra figure, partly in her bouts of gloominess compared to Louis’s general “optimism.” Stevenson’s parents had been worried about their son’s liaison with an older woman, yet they fell in love with her when they met her, which speaks well of them. Louis’s father, Thomas, a wealthy engineer whose own father had devised the famous Stevenson lighthouses, nicknamed his daughter-in-law Cassandra, only partly in jest. Margaret, Louis’s mother, was a more joyful figure, and proved to be resilient after her husband’s death, sailing with Louis’s gypsy family to the South Seas. Louis had grown up with money, abandoned engineering for law, then abandoned law for literature, but he had always been able to depend on an allowance to keep him afloat. Fanny’s life had been more precarious, her risk-taking more remarkable.&lt;lb/&gt; The couple moved constantly in search of a healthy environment for Louis. For some productive years they lived at Skerryvore, their house in Bournemouth. The climate was disastrous for Louis, but he made some of his strongest friendships there, especially with Henry James. Damrosch quotes a fascinating description of Fanny by one of their visitors, who observed Stevenson “rolling a limp cigarette in his long, limp fingers, and talking eagerly all the while.” Then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opposite him sits Mrs. Stevenson, the tutelary genius of Skerryvore, a woman of small physical stature, but surely of heroic mould. Her features are clear-cut and delicate, but marked by unmistakable strength of character; her hair of an unglossy black, and her complexion darker than one would expect in a woman of Dutch-American race. I have heard her speak of a Moorish strain in her ancestry. . . . Beneath a placid though always alert and vivacious exterior, Mrs. Stevenson conceals much personal suffering and continual anxieties under which many a stronger woman might well break down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny managed their lives, found them homes to live in, and when they contemplated their South Sea voyages, it was she who sought out, rented and stocked the three successive boats they sailed on. In one of the stranger images of Fanny, she can be seen on the deck of a sailboat holding two pistols, shooting at sharks. It’s a glimpse of unexpected cruelty, rather like the young Louis mercilessly beating Modestine on his travels through the Cévennes.&lt;lb/&gt; They endured rough seas, making a bold menagerie together with Margaret, Lloyd and Belle. As Louis wrote to one acquaintance, “Six months on tinned meats, without any vegetables, is a thing to be remembered; most hardships become easy with continuance, not hardship of diet; towards the end I think we could all have wept at sight of an onion.”&lt;lb/&gt; In Samoa, while Louis’s health improved, Fanny did ultimately have a complete nervous collapse, perhaps due to the accumulated pressures of their life. She recovered and endured Louis’s death and sold Vailima, eventually finding another younger lover and dying in Santa Barbara, California, in 1914. Belle took her ashes to be buried with Louis. The unconventionality continued, as Fanny’s younger lover became Belle’s second husband. Lloyd kept writing books with little success and died in Glendale, California, in 1947. Belle died in Santa Barbara in 1953.&lt;lb/&gt; As it turned out, the storyteller, Tusitala, had been the most remarkable figure in their lives. “He was indeed all his life a bag of bones,” wrote his friend Sidney Colvin, who would later publish a censored edition of his letters. “Nevertheless when he was in the room it was the other people, and not he, who seemed the shadows.” For Richard Holmes, “He was the man who opened the magic door. His wit, his style, his courage, his wanderlust, all enchanted me. . . . He made England seem small, and the world look big.” Jorges Luis Borges would write, “Ever since childhood Stevenson has been for me one of the forms of happiness.”&lt;lb/&gt; Leo Damrosch set forth in this book “to celebrate what is great in his writing, and to inspire new readers to enjoy it.” I would say “Mission accomplished,” but Stevenson would deplore the cliché.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it’s the natural shape of Stevenson’s life, or maybe it’s Damrosch’s enthusiasm for his subject, but this is a dream biography.&lt;lb/&gt; Many pages of Storyteller take up Stevenson’s frailty, his scrawniness, bouts of lung trouble and travels in search of a cure. He and his wife, Fanny, built a sprawling mansion in Samoa, which they called Vailima. There he enjoyed a few final years of robust health. It wasn’t TB that killed him, but a stroke—he had always loved tobacco and whisky. Damrosch quotes an account written by Stevenson’s stepdaughter, Belle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems he had been looking on watching my mother making a salad, and was dropping the oil for her with a perfectly steady hand. He suddenly said, “What is that?” or “What a pain!” and put both hands to his head. “Do I look strange?” he asked, and then he reeled and fell backwards. His favourite boy Sosimo [a Samoan servant] caught him and carried him into the big room, and he never was conscious after.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They had been in Samoa for just over four years,” Damrosch remarks, “—the longest Louis ever lived in one place during his entire adult life.”&lt;lb/&gt; Samoan people genuinely honored Stevenson, calling him Tusitala, or “storyteller.” During a period of civil strife on the island, a taboo had been declared against doing any harm to Vailima and its inhabitants, even though Louis (as he was familiarly called) sided with one chieftain over the others. Having been a socialist when young—about the time he renounced the Scottish Calvinism he was raised with—he had become a skeptic about political causes. Samoa changed that by showing him the dark side of Western imperialism, and in A Footnote to History (1892) he wrote passionately for the cause of independence. The chief Stevenson had favored, Mata’afa, lost in the civil war and was banished (at least he wasn’t beheaded like some of his cohort). Another chief stood at Stevenson’s funeral to deliver a eulogy: “When Mata’afa was taken, who was our support but Tusitala? We were in prison, and he cared for us. We were sick, and he made us well. We were hungry, and he fed us. The day was no longer than his kindness. You are great people and full of love. Yet who among you is so great as Tusitala? What is your love to his love?”&lt;lb/&gt; In a few photographs we can see the burning energy and spirit in Stevenson’s eyes. His conversation won him fervent friends, some of whom fell out with him over time. None of the friends in Damrosch’s account moves me more than Henry James, who loved Louis and Fanny Stevenson from the moment he met them in London. When other friends complained about Stevenson leaving home and setting sail for the Pacific islands, James defended him, though he missed Louis terribly. James’s letters to Fanny after Louis’s death move me right down to the ground:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To “my dear Fanny Stevenson” James sent a long and tender letter of sympathy, beginning with “What can I say to you that will not seem cruelly irrelevant and vain?” After praising her “courage and patience and fortitude,” which would be much needed, he went on to say, “To have lived in the light of that splendid life, that beautiful, bountiful being—only to see it, from one moment to the other, converted into a fable as strange and romantic as one of his own, a thing that has been and has ended, is an anguish into which no one can enter with you fully, and of which no one can drain the cup for you. You are nearest to the pain, because you were nearest the joy and the pride.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;James went on, and I simply must quote it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;He has gone in time not to be old—early enough to have been so generously young and late enough to have drunk deep of the cup. There have been—I think—for men of letters few deaths more romantically right. Forgive me, I beg you, what may sound cold-blooded in such words—and as if I imagined there could be anything for you “right” in the rupture of such an affection and the loss of such a presence. I have in my mind, in that view, only the rounded career and the consecrated work. When I think of your own situation I fall into a mere confusion of pity and wonder—with the sole sense of your being as brave a spirit as he was (all of whose bravery you endlessly shared) to hold on by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may wonder that I have begun my review with this postmortem. I dwell on it not only because it touched me more than I have been touched by a biography in many years, but because Damrosch earns my tears. I should turn next to two crucial aspects of Stevenson’s life: the quality of his writing and the extraordinary woman he married, who made him a better writer and gave him his happiest years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; My ancestors were Scottish, and Robert Louis Stevenson was an honored name in our household. I remember our illustrated edition of A Child’s Garden of Verses (1885), of which Henry James had written, “A child might have written it if a child could see childhood from the outside.” But in poems like “Rain” and “My Shadow,” Stevenson writes from the inside of childhood, at his best when he avoids moralizing. Damrosch quotes the famous couplet called “Happy Thought,” which a lesser critic would find sentimental: “The world is so full of a number of things, / I’m sure we should all be as happy as kings.” Damrosch sees that the poem is not sentimental at all: “Astonished by the richness of the world, a child is amazed that people are not happy.” In our time, astonishment and awe are among the things people who think themselves sophisticated will sneer at. They are idiots, already pickled in their opinions. Damrosch understands his subject’s generous sympathy, the way he captures “what it’s like to be small.”&lt;lb/&gt; I have never forgotten “The Land of Counterpane,” even though I had no idea what a counterpane was, and of course “The Land of Nod”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From breakfast on through all the day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;At home among my friends I stay;&lt;lb/&gt;But every night I go abroad&lt;lb/&gt;Afar into the land of Nod.&lt;lb/&gt;All by myself I have to go,&lt;lb/&gt;With none to tell me what to do—&lt;lb/&gt;All alone beside the streams&lt;lb/&gt;And up the mountain-sides of dreams.&lt;lb/&gt;The strangest things are there for me,&lt;lb/&gt;Both things to eat and things to see,&lt;lb/&gt;And many frightening sights abroad&lt;lb/&gt;Till morning in the land of Nod.&lt;lb/&gt;Try as I like to find the way,&lt;lb/&gt;I never can get back by day,&lt;lb/&gt;Nor can remember plain and clear&lt;lb/&gt;The curious music that I hear.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the same way, I remember my early childhood encounter with a dramatic recording of Treasure Island (1883), in which the deaths of Billy Bones and Old Pew scared the bejesus out of me. I found stalwart adulthood in Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey but, like everyone else, was most beguiled by Long John Silver and his parrot, Captain Flint. Any boy of my generation would have wanted to be Jim Hawkins. In a late poem, “In the Attic,” Seamus Heaney seems to have felt the same:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I age and blank on names,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;As my uncertainty on stairs&lt;lb/&gt;Is more and more the lightheadedness&lt;lb/&gt;Of a cabin boy’s first time on the rigging,&lt;lb/&gt;As the memorable bottoms out&lt;lb/&gt;Into the irretrievable,&lt;lb/&gt;It’s not that I can’t imagine still&lt;lb/&gt;That slight untoward rupture and world-tilt&lt;lb/&gt;As a wind freshened and the anchor weighed.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just weeks ago, I re-read Treasure Island in a cheap paperback with a cheesy cartoon for a cover and was transported once again by its perfect plotting and the lucid exactitude of its prose: an island snake hisses “with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top,” and tropical foliage has “a kind of poisonous brightness.” Call it a children’s book or a young adult novel or what you will, it’s bloody great—and pretty bloody, too. When Stevenson met Mark Twain in New York, the two must have wondered at having found their biggest success writing for young people, but both excelled at conveying the violence that makes our moral choices important and difficult. They understood what it means to grow.&lt;lb/&gt; Treasure Island and Kidnapped (1886) are probably two of the most influential novels on my own life. I’ve never read Catriona (1893), the sequel to Kidnapped, which Damrosch praises on its literary merits, nor have I read The Master of Ballantrae (1889) or the important and unfinished final novel, Weir of Hermiston (1896). Based on Damrosch’s critical overviews, I should make time for them.&lt;lb/&gt; The adventure story and the historical romance were two genres at which Stevenson excelled, but he was also brilliant at the macabre psychological parable in his novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), and the supernatural in his short story “Thrawn Janet” (1881). The first of these takes on the very “fortress of identity” (in Jekyll’s words) that has so obsessed us of late but turns it into something timeless. Damrosch tells us that the novella caused a furious argument between Stevenson and his wife, in which she comes off better than he does. When Louis read aloud his first draft, as Fanny’s son Lloyd recalled, “Her praise was constrained; the words seemed to come with difficulty; and then all at once she broke out with criticism. He had missed the point, she said; had missed the allegory; had made it merely a story—a magnificent bit of sensationalism—when it should have been a masterpiece.” Damrosch continues, “Fanny’s point was that Louis had ruined the story by turning it into a mere tale about a secret life. . . . What was needed was not just a character wearing a disguise, but something far more profound: a character struggling with a deeper hidden self that breaks loose and fights for supremacy.” Louis resisted, then came around, went back to work, and gave her the masterpiece she wanted. Thereafter, he jokingly referred to her as “the critic on the hearth.”&lt;lb/&gt; A friend reminds me of novels like The Wrong Box (1889), one of several Stevenson wrote in collaboration with his stepson, Lloyd. I remember an enjoyable movie but haven’t read the book. It’s the short stories I’ve dwelt in lately, including “The Body Snatcher” and “A Lodging for the Night,” a brilliant tale of the medieval French poet François Villon. Stevenson never idealizes his protagonist: “The poet was a rag of a man, dark, little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and thin black locks. He carried his four-and-twenty years with feverish animation. Greed had made folds about his eyes, evil smiles had puckered his mouth. The wolf and pig struggled together in his face. It was an eloquent, sharp, ugly, earthy countenance.” The style is kinetic, giving us action rather than explanation. You can learn from him. It was not until late in Stevenson’s short life that he felt free to write about women and sexual attraction, but within the Victorian mores of the time, he produced work charged with dark human energy, wildness and suspense that made so many of his tales excellent fodder for the movies.&lt;lb/&gt; Like Lawrence, he was also a pioneering travel writer, starting with his early books about France, An Inland Voyage (1878) and Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes (1879). The second of these is a small classic, an inspiration to nearly every travel writer since. It also inspired Richard Holmes, who undertook to follow the same journey as a way of empathizing with Stevenson the Francophile and wrote about it years later in Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer (1985). In his Paris Review interview, Holmes remembers “working out that for his Travels, Stevenson had this wonderful smell of wet Scottish tweed, French tobacco, and warm brandy. Because it always rained up there, he always rolled his own cigarettes, and he always carried a large flask of Cognac in his pocket. And then of course there was the smell of his donkey, Modestine.” Holmes practiced a peripatetic method of which Stevenson would have approved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny Stevenson was the kind of woman most people found fascinating—beautiful and brainy and brave. You can test your feelings about people in this biography by how they respond to her. Some, including Alice James, found her skin too dusky and her manners vulgar—like Louis, she rolled her own cigarettes. Down with Alice, says I. The writer Edmund Gosse described Fanny as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;She was one of the strangest people who have lived in our time, a sort of savage nature in some ways, but very lovable—extraordinarily passionate, and unlike everyone else in her violent feelings and unrestrained ways of expressing them—full of gaiety, and with a genius for expressing things picturesquely. . . . I think R.L.S. must have caught some of his ways of feeling from her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gosse would, according to Damrosch, come “to resent what he saw as Fanny’s power over Louis, but still he admired her.”&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny was ten years older than Louis. They became lovers long before she secured a divorce from her philandering husband, Sam Osbourne. Louis’s sexual experiences had begun early in his life as an Edinburgh student, so by the time he met Fanny in Bohemian circles in France, they were both pretty well liberated from social mores, interested in living as artistic gypsies. Her daughter, Belle, would write that “Louis brought into our lives a sort of joyousness hard to describe.” For his part, Stevenson fell fiercely in love with Fanny’s cool-headed humor. Belle again: “Fanny Osbourne’s voice was low in tone, and she spoke with very little modulation. Louis described it as sounding like ‘water running under ice.’”&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny hesitated, returning to her husband more than once out of love for him and concern for their children, one of whom had died young. Finally, Sam’s infidelity became too much, and Louis’s persistence won through. The couple married in San Francisco in 1880. He was thirty, she forty. Louis had been so ill with lung disease that neither believed he would live much longer. Yet Belle later recalled passing in a hallway outside their bedroom “and stopping suddenly at a light joyous sound. With a catch at my heart, I realized it was the first time I had ever heard my mother laugh.” Damrosch concludes,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More than any of Louis’s biographers, Richard Holmes does justice to this remarkable union. “When one considers other Victorian literary marriages—Hardy’s, say, or Dickens’s—Stevenson’s is something phenomenal, dynamic, explosive. It contained energies, tempests, fireworks, and sheer anarchic excitement that would have obliterated any conventional household. To find anything like his relationship with Fanny—and the comparison is significant in the largest way—one would have to look forward to Lawrence and Frieda.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a kind of person who despises enthusiasm, or fears it, and cannot abide happiness in others. I have seen this. The same sort of person looks at a Cassandra and does not believe a word she says. Fanny was a Cassandra figure, partly in her bouts of gloominess compared to Louis’s general “optimism.” Stevenson’s parents had been worried about their son’s liaison with an older woman, yet they fell in love with her when they met her, which speaks well of them. Louis’s father, Thomas, a wealthy engineer whose own father had devised the famous Stevenson lighthouses, nicknamed his daughter-in-law Cassandra, only partly in jest. Margaret, Louis’s mother, was a more joyful figure, and proved to be resilient after her husband’s death, sailing with Louis’s gypsy family to the South Seas. Louis had grown up with money, abandoned engineering for law, then abandoned law for literature, but he had always been able to depend on an allowance to keep him afloat. Fanny’s life had been more precarious, her risk-taking more remarkable.&lt;lb/&gt; The couple moved constantly in search of a healthy environment for Louis. For some productive years they lived at Skerryvore, their house in Bournemouth. The climate was disastrous for Louis, but he made some of his strongest friendships there, especially with Henry James. Damrosch quotes a fascinating description of Fanny by one of their visitors, who observed Stevenson “rolling a limp cigarette in his long, limp fingers, and talking eagerly all the while.” Then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opposite him sits Mrs. Stevenson, the tutelary genius of Skerryvore, a woman of small physical stature, but surely of heroic mould. Her features are clear-cut and delicate, but marked by unmistakable strength of character; her hair of an unglossy black, and her complexion darker than one would expect in a woman of Dutch-American race. I have heard her speak of a Moorish strain in her ancestry. . . . Beneath a placid though always alert and vivacious exterior, Mrs. Stevenson conceals much personal suffering and continual anxieties under which many a stronger woman might well break down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Fanny managed their lives, found them homes to live in, and when they contemplated their South Sea voyages, it was she who sought out, rented and stocked the three successive boats they sailed on. In one of the stranger images of Fanny, she can be seen on the deck of a sailboat holding two pistols, shooting at sharks. It’s a glimpse of unexpected cruelty, rather like the young Louis mercilessly beating Modestine on his travels through the Cévennes.&lt;lb/&gt; They endured rough seas, making a bold menagerie together with Margaret, Lloyd and Belle. As Louis wrote to one acquaintance, “Six months on tinned meats, without any vegetables, is a thing to be remembered; most hardships become easy with continuance, not hardship of diet; towards the end I think we could all have wept at sight of an onion.”&lt;lb/&gt; In Samoa, while Louis’s health improved, Fanny did ultimately have a complete nervous collapse, perhaps due to the accumulated pressures of their life. She recovered and endured Louis’s death and sold Vailima, eventually finding another younger lover and dying in Santa Barbara, California, in 1914. Belle took her ashes to be buried with Louis. The unconventionality continued, as Fanny’s younger lover became Belle’s second husband. Lloyd kept writing books with little success and died in Glendale, California, in 1947. Belle died in Santa Barbara in 1953.&lt;lb/&gt; As it turned out, the storyteller, Tusitala, had been the most remarkable figure in their lives. “He was indeed all his life a bag of bones,” wrote his friend Sidney Colvin, who would later publish a censored edition of his letters. “Nevertheless when he was in the room it was the other people, and not he, who seemed the shadows.” For Richard Holmes, “He was the man who opened the magic door. His wit, his style, his courage, his wanderlust, all enchanted me. . . . He made England seem small, and the world look big.” Jorges Luis Borges would write, “Ever since childhood Stevenson has been for me one of the forms of happiness.”&lt;lb/&gt; Leo Damrosch set forth in this book “to celebrate what is great in his writing, and to inspire new readers to enjoy it.” I would say “Mission accomplished,” but Stevenson would deplore the cliché.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Hidden Engineering of Niagara Falls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Niagara Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world. With a vertical drop of more than 50 meters or 164 feet and a flow rate that often exceeds 2800 cubic meters per second or 100,000 cubic feet per second, it’s one of North America’s crown jewels. Roughly ten million people visit the falls every year just to catch a glimpse of the curtains of water pouring over the edge and the constant clouds of mist at the bottom. But Niagara Falls isn’t just a tourist attraction. The special geology and hydrology of this region, situated between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, have resulted in some fascinating feats of infrastructure, from shipping to electricity to water control. It’s basically a microcosm of all the things I love. The falls themselves have required quite a bit of engineering over the years, and they’ve even been shut off for maintenance. Let’s take a little tour of the Niagara Peninsula (even though it’s really an isthmus), and I’ll show you some of the things that aren’t usually listed in a guidebook. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s get oriented first. This is a map of the isthmus. We’ve got Lake Erie to the south, Lake Ontario to the north, Buffalo and western New York to the East, and Ontario, Canada, to the west. The Niagara River runs northward, connecting the two great lakes. And right in the middle, it plunges off the Niagara Escarpment, creating the famous falls. On the US side, there are the American Falls and the smaller Bridal Veil Falls. And on the Canadian side is the Horseshoe Falls where a majority of the river flows. It’s pretty impressive to see in person, but it’s actually not entirely a benefit. Because these falls pose a major problem for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Great Lakes form the largest inland freshwater transportation system in the world. Since the 19th century, they’ve served as the backbone for moving iron ore, coal, grain, and manufactured goods between the American heartland and the Atlantic Ocean. Ore from Minnesota and grain from the Midwest can travel by ship all the way to steel mills or export terminals on the East Coast. Barges and freighters are efficient at moving bulk cargo in a way rail and trucks can’t match. For a time, the Niagara Escarpment was a natural bottleneck between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, preventing goods from moving directly between the upper lakes and the Atlantic. Freight had to be offloaded and portaged around the falls before it could continue its journey. The Erie Canal solved the problem somewhat, starting in 1825, bypassing Lake Ontario. But it could only accommodate smaller vessels, and even before the Canal opened, another solution was being planned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Welland Canal runs through the peninsula west of the Niagara River, connecting two massive areas by shipping traffic for the first time in 1829. The canal fueled the early growth of cities along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River - including Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City - and it’s been rebuilt and moved several times over its life. The Welland Canal is really a titanic engineering achievement and, were it not positioned next to one of the natural wonders of the world, it would probably be famous in its own right. Because of the huge difference in elevation between the two lakes created by the escarpment, eight separate locks are required to allow ships to traverse between them. And all different kinds do - from personal leisure craft to the lakers that stay in fresh water to the salties that travel between the lakes and the ocean through the St. Lawrence Seaway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting on the upstream, Lake Erie side of the canal, the first lock isn’t really for lifting or lowering ships so much as for control. The level of Lake Erie actually fluctuates throughout the year, and there are longer-term trends as well. Wind storms also raise the level locally similar to the way storm surge works during hurricanes. The control lock does just that: it controls the level in the downstream canal. It prevents excess water from rushing down the canal when the lake is high, kind of like an airlock on a spaceship keeps air from rushing out when astronauts step outside for a spacewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downstream of the control lock, the canal splits in two. The original pathway of the canal flows through the eponymous town of Welland, while the larger and newer section of canal, the Welland Bypass… well, it bypasses Welland to the east. If you look carefully, you’ll also notice a small river, the Welland River, which passes underneath both the original and bypass canals. On the way downstream from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, shipping traffic passes over aqueducts that pass over a natural river. A hydrological wonderland!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing downstream from the aqueducts, the remaining seven locks are lift locks, more like what you think of when you imagine a lock. Notice how they’re clustered tightly around the terrain and not distributed evenly along the length of the canal. That’s the Niagara escarpment, the same geological feature that the water cascades down at the falls. This is the elevation diagram of the entire Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway system from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean, and you can see that this drop is the biggest one of the whole thing. And that’s pretty important for another part of the infrastructure on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power available from a moving fluid is directly proportional to the flow rate multiplied by the height of the drop. In most hydropower applications, that height is created artificially by a dam. There aren’t that many places in the world where you have both a large volume of flowing water and a significant natural drop in elevation. But that combination made Niagara Falls the birthplace of large-scale electric power in North America. In 1895, the Niagara Power Company opened the Edward Dean Adams Power Plant, built with Westinghouse AC generators based on the ideas and patents of Nikola Tesla. The plant served as the basis for the modern electrical grids we have today, and many of the fundamental concepts are basically unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the power infrastructure at Niagara Falls definitely has changed. Where the Adams Power Plant put out about 40 megawatts of power in 1895, now the combined capacity from the region is in the neighborhood of 5 gigawatts. But in both cases, it wasn’t as simple as putting a turbine at the base of the falls. While it might be technically possible to generate power by placing a water wheel directly in the stream of a waterfall like a kid’s bath toy, it’s not the most efficient way (plus it would take away from the beauty). The water used to power the hydroelectric plants on both the US and Canadian sides of the Niagara River is water that never actually flows over the falls. Instead, it’s diverted into five massive tunnels - two on the US side and three on the Canadian side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most tunnels, you can’t really see the extent of the hydro tunnels at Niagara Falls. There are a few conspicuous clues though, like these gigantic buildings. These interesting protrusions from the landscape house enormous steel doors, nearly 60 feet tall, that can drop down into the tunnels and close off the flow for inspections and maintenance. Both the Ontario and New York sides of the river feature similar structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the tunnels, water flows into major hydropower plants on both sides of the border: the twin Adam Beck stations on the Canadian side and Robert Moses station on the US side. Then it’s released into the the lower part of the river below the falls. When you add them up, that’s 39 turbines with a combined capacity of more than 4000 megawatts. It’s a tremendous amount of power generation in one place. But actually, that’s not all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tunnels divert 50-75% of the flow of the Niagara River. That wide range in percentage of diversion isn’t because we don’t know how much is diverted, but because we actually control how much water is diverted, depending on the tourist requirements agreed upon in a treaty by both nations. During the day in peak tourist season, more water is allowed to flow over the falls to ensure the grandeur of the falls is on full display for the huge crowds of tourists that visit every year. At night and during the winter, more of the flow is diverted to generate power. That’s all managed by this structure upstream of the falls: the international control dam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought this is an interesting dam, since it doesn’t even go all the way across the river. But it doesn’t need to. This structure’s not meant to create a reservoir; it just subtly adjusts the level in the river to control how much water flows over the falls versus into the hydropower intakes. The US side of the Niagara River is pretty shallow, so that side acts kind of like an uncontrolled spillway. Then, the gates on the Canadian side can be adjusted to balance the competing demands on water between tourism and power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s one big problem with those competing needs: they both have the same timing. We want thunderous cascades of water over the falls during the day when tourists are visiting, but daytime is also when the demand for electricity is highest. It’s like if solar panels only worked at night. To accommodate this, both the US and Canada have pumped storage plants. At night, excess electricity is used to pump diverted water into reservoirs, essentially storing both the power and the extra water that’s available during off-peak hours. Then, during the day, the water is released back into the forebay of the power plants. You get a little extra power from that drop out of the reservoir into the forebays, so both sides have small hydropower facilities to capture that. But more importantly, you get a lot more water during the day than would otherwise be available to run through the big plants, making more power when it’s needed most. And there’s just something funny to me that the infrastructure is duplicated on both sides of the river, like neither country was willing to be one-upped by the other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this diversion noticeably reduces the flow of water over the falls. Even when they are at ‘full blast’ during the day in the tourist season, only 50% of the flow of the Niagara River makes it over the falls. You can imagine how powerful the falls would be if 100% of the flow were to cascade over. It might seem like this diversion detracts from the majesty of the falls, but in another sense, it actually preserves it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All waterfalls undergo some degree of erosion as the water and sediment suspended in it scours away the rocks and soil underneath. Without any diversion, Niagara Falls would be receding towards Lake Erie at a rate of about 3 feet every year. At the end of the last ice age, the falls were right at the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, but thousands of years of erosion have caused them to work their way upstream. You can actually see how far it’s already progressed by looking at this elevation map. Over the last 12,000 years or so, the falls have migrated by erosion to their current location. By diverting a significant portion of the flow, the power plants have actually slowed the rate of erosion to approximately one foot per year, which will help preserve the falls for a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While flow on the falls is downregulated by diversion for hydropower, the falls are never ‘turned off’...except for the one time in the 1960s. The smaller American Falls (and nearby Bridal Veil Falls) have a pile of loose rocks and boulders, called talus, at their base. This pile of rocky debris actually extends a good fraction of the way up the falls, and officials worried that the falls might ultimately transition into a series of rapids cascading down the slope of talus rather than remaining a majestic waterfall. So, in 1969, the Army Corps of Engineers built a temporary cofferdam between the New York shoreline and Goat Island, diverting the water over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and leaving the American Falls dry(ish)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the engineers got a chance to inspect the situation, they determined that the best course of action was just to leave the majority of the talus in place, since it seemed to be stabilizing the cliff face. Sometimes, doing mostly nothing is a decision you make as an engineer, even if you have to do a monumental amount of work to come to that conclusion. So the cofferdam was taken out, and water has flowed continuously over all the falls since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really highlights the complexity of Niagara Falls. On the one hand, you have one of the natural wonders of the world, an absolutely enormous set of waterfalls that inspire awe and wonder in the countless travelers who are lucky enough to take in the view. The same thing that makes it impressive for tourists (the big drop) makes it valuable for power and a major challenge for shipping. And out of that comes all kinds of fascinating infrastructure, not only to facilitate the tourism but the other stuff too: a major canal with locks and aqueducts, the international dam control gates, pumped storage reservoirs, epic tunnels, towering gates, massive hydropower plants, and so much more. It’s really a pretty remarkable place for engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strix Halo is the codename for AMD’s highest end mobile chip, which is used in the Ryzen AI MAX series. It combines a powerful CPU with 16 Zen 5 cores and a large GPU with 20 RDNA 3.5 Workgroup Processors (WGPs). The sizeable iGPU makes Strix Halo particularly interesting because GPUs have high bandwidth requirements. Strix Halo tackles that with a 256-bit LPDDR5X-8000 setup combined with 32 MB of memory side cache. The latter is often referred to as Infinity Cache, or MALL (Memory Attached Last Level). I’ll refer to it as Infinity Cache for brevity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infinity Cache has been around since RDNA2 in AMD’s discrete consumer GPU lineup, where it helped AMD hit high performance targets with lower DRAM bandwidth requirements. However, Infinity Cache’s efficacy has so far been difficult for me to evaluate. AMD’s discrete GPUs have performance monitoring facilities accessible through AMD’s developer tools. But those tools stop providing information past L2. Strix Halo stands out because it has an Infinity Cache implementation, and all the accessible performance monitoring features typical of a recent AMD GPU. That includes programmable performance counters at Infinity Fabric and memory controllers. It’s an opportunity to finally get insight into how well AMD’s Infinity Cache does its job in various graphics workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Special thanks goes out to ASUS for sampling their ROG Flow Z13. This device implements AMD’s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 with 32 GB of LPDDR5X in a thin and light form factor. It superficially represents a convertible tablet from Microsoft’s Surface line, and is remarkably portable for a device with gaming credentials. Without ASUS’s help, this article wouldn’t have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Infinity Fabric, Performance Monitoring, and Theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD’s Infinity Fabric aims to abstract away details of how data travels across the chip. It does so by providing endpoints with well defined interfaces to let blocks make or handle memory requests. Infinity Fabric also provides a set of programmable performance counters. AMD documents a single DATA_BW performance event that counts data beats at endpoints. DATA_BW targets an endpoint via its 8-bit instance ID, and can count either reads or writes. AMD never documented Infinity Fabric instance IDs for Strix Halo. So, I did some guessing by generating traffic at various blocks and observing bandwidth counts at all possible instance IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instance IDs start from the Coherent Stations (CS-es), just like on server platforms. CS blocks sit in front of memory controllers and ensure cache coherency by probing another block if it might have a modified copy of the requested cacheline. If it doesn’t, which is most of the time, the CS will pass the request on to its attached Unified Memory Controller (UMC). Because CS blocks observe all requests to physical memory backed by DRAM, it’s a logical place to implement a memory side cache. That’s exactly what AMD does on chips with Infinity Cache. Cache hits let the CS avoid going to the UMC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strix Halo has 16 memory controllers and CS instances, each handling a 16-bit LPDDR5X channel. The GPU occupies the next eight instance IDs, suggesting it has a wide interface to Infinity Fabric. CPU core clusters come next. Each octa-core Zen 5 Core Complex (CCX) connects to Infinity Fabric via one endpoint. Miscellaneous blocks follow. These include the NPU, media engine, the display engine, and a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up Performance Monitoring&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cache misses usually cause a request to the next level in the memory hierarchy, while cache hits do not. Therefore, my idea is to compare traffic levels at the CS and UMC levels. Traffic that shows up at the CS but not at the UMCs can be used as a proxy for Infinity Cache hits. There are a few problems with that approach though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Strix Halo only provides eight Infinity Fabric performance counters. I have to use two counters per endpoint to count both read and write data beats, so I can only monitor four CS-es simultaneously. Memory traffic is interleaved across channels, so taking bandwidth observed at four CS-es and multiplying by four should give a reasonably accurate estimate of overall bandwidth. But interleaving isn’t perfectly even in practice, so I expect a few percentage points of error. The UMC situation is easier. Each UMC has its own set of four performance counters, letting me monitor all of them at the same time. I’m using one counter per UMC to count Column Address Strobe (CAS) commands. Other available UMC events allow monitoring memory controller frequency, bus utilization, and ACTIVATE or PRECHARGE commands. But that stuff goes beyond what I want to focus on here, and collecting more data points would make for annoyingly large spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-CCX traffic presents a second source of error as mentioned above. If a CS sends a probe that hits a modified line, it won’t send a request to the UMC. The request is still being satisfied out of cache, just not the Infinity Cache that I’m interested in. I expect this to be rare because cross-CCX traffic in general is usually low compared to requests satisfied from DRAM. It’ll be especially rare in the graphics workloads I’m targeting here because Strix Halo’s second CCD tends to be parked in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU-side traffic in general presents a more significant issue. Strix Halo’s Infinity Cache narrowly targets the GPU, and only GPU-side memory requests cause cache fills. CPU memory accesses will be counted as misses in a hitrate calculation. That may be technically correct, but misses the point of Infinity Cache. Most memory traffic comes from the GPU, but there’s enough CPU-side traffic to create a bit more of an error bar than I’d like. Therefore, I want to focus on whether Infinity Cache is handling enough traffic to avoid hitting DRAM bandwidth bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A final limitation is that I’m sampling performance counters with a tool I wrote years ago. I wrote it so I could look at hardware performance stats just like how I like looking at Task Manager or other monitoring utilities to see how my system is doing. Because I’m updating a graphical interface, I sample data every second and thus have lower resolution compared to some vendor tools. Those can often sample at millisecond granularity or better. That opens the window to underestimating bandwidth demands if a bandwidth spike only occurs over a small fraction of a second. In theory I could write another tool. But Chips and Cheese is an unpaid hobby project that has to be balanced with a separate full time job as well as other free time interests. Quickly rigging an existing project to do my bidding makes more efficient use of time, because there’s never enough time to do everything I want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I logged data over some arbitrarily selected graphics workloads, then selected the 1-second interval with the highest DRAM bandwidth usage. That should give an idea of whether Strix Halo comes close to reaching DRAM bandwidth limits. Overall, the 32 MB cache seems to do its job. Strix Halo is able to stay well clear of the 256 GB/s theoretical bandwidth limit that its LPDDR5X-8000 setup can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximate CS-side bandwidth demands do indicate several workloads can push uncomfortably close to 256 GB/s. A workload doesn’t necessarily have to get right up to bandwidth limits for memory-related performance issues to start cropping up. Under high bandwidth demand, requests can start to pile up in various queues and end-to-end memory latency can increase. GHPC and Ungine Valley fall into that category. 3DMark Time Spy Extreme would definitely be DRAM bandwidth bound without the memory side cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking an interval with maximum bandwidth demands at the CS gives an idea of how much bandwidth Strix Halo’s GPU can demand. Strix Halo has the same 2 MB of graphics L2 cache that AMD’s older 7000 series “Phoenix” mobile chip had, despite more than doubling GPU compute throughput. Unsurprisingly, the GPU can draw a lot of bandwidth across Infinity Fabric. 3DMark Time Spy again stands out. If AMD wanted to simply scale up DRAM bandwidth without spending die area on cache, they would need well over 335 GB/s from DRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curiously, Digital Foundry notes that Strix Halo has very similar graphics performance to the PS5. The PS5 uses a 256-bit, 14 GT/s GDDR6 setup that’s good for 448 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth, and doesn’t have a memory side cache like Strix Halo. 448 GB/s looks just about adequate for satisfying Time Spy Extreme’s bandwidth needs, if just barely. If Strix Halo didn’t need to work in power constrained mobile devices, and didn’t need high memory capacity for multitasking, perhaps AMD could have considered a GDDR6 setup. To bring things back around to Infinity Cache, it seems to do very well at that interval above. It captures approximately 73% of memory traffic going through Infinity Fabric, which is good even from a hitrate point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two bar graphs above already hint at how bandwidth demands and cache hitrates vary across workloads. Those figures vary within a workload as well, though plotting all of the logged data would be excessive. Variation both across and within workloads makes it extremely difficult to summarize cache efficacy with a single hitrate figure. Plotting the percentage of traffic at the CS not observed at the UMCs as a proxy for hitrate further emphasizes that point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resolution settings can impact cache hitrate as well. While I don’t have a direct look at hitrate figures, plotting with the data I do have suggests increasing resolution in the Ungine Valley benchmark tends to depress hitrate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD presented a slide at Hot Chips 2021 with three lines for different resolutions across a set of different cache capacities. I obviously can’t test different cache capacities. But AMD’s slide does beg the question of how well a 32 MB cache can do at a wider range of resolutions, and whether bandwidth demands remain under control at resolutions higher than what AMD may have optimized the platform for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ungine Superposition and 3DMark workloads can both target a variety of resolutions without regard to monitor resolution. Logging data throughout benchmark runs at different resolutions shows the 32 MB cache providing reasonable “bandwidth amplification” at reasonable resolutions. At unreasonable resolutions, the cache is still able to do something. But it’s not as effective as it was at lower resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plotting data over time shows spikes and dips in Infinity Cache efficacy occur at remarkably consistent times, even at different resolutions. 8K is an exception with the Superposition benchmark. The 8K line looks stretched out, possibly because Strix Halo’s GPU was only able to average a bit over 10 FPS, and time got slowed a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Strix Halo’s iGPU were capable of delivering over 30 FPS in Superposition, AMD would definitely need a larger cache, more DRAM bandwidth, or a combination of both. Taking a simplistic view and tripling maximum observed 8K bandwidth demands would give a figure just north of 525 GB/s. But Strix Halo’s iGPU clearly wasn’t built with such a scenario in mind, and AMD’s selected combination of cache capacity and DRAM bandwidth works well enough at all tested resolutions. While high resolutions create the most DRAM traffic, 1080P shows the heaviest bandwidth demands at the Infinity Fabric level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3DMark Wild Life Extreme is a better example because it’s a lightweight benchmark designed to run on mobile devices. Strix Halo’s iGPU can average above 30 FPS even when rendering at 8K. Again, DRAM bandwidth demands increase and Infinity Cache becomes less effective as resolution goes up. But Infinity Cache still does enough to keep the chip well clear of DRAM bandwidth limits. Thus the cache does its job, and the bandwidth situation remains under control across a wide range of resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bandwidth demands are more important than hitrates. Curiously though, Wild Life Extreme experiences increasingly severe hitrate dips at higher resolutions around the 16-19 and 45-52 second intervals. Those dips barely show at 1440P or below. Perhaps a 32 MB cache’s efficacy also shows more variation as resolution increases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Video?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few errors here - I said Core Coherent Master read/write beats were 32B and 64B/cycle. It’s not per cycle, it’s per data beat. And I meant to say reads outnumber writes at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chip designers have to tune their designs to perform well across a wide variety of workloads. Cache sizes are one parameter on the list. AMD chose to combine a 32 MB cache with 256 GB/s of DRAM bandwidth, and it seems to do well enough across the workloads I tested. Monitoring at the CS-es and UMCs also supports AMD’s data showing that higher resolutions tend to depress hitrate. Those results explain why larger GPUs tend to have larger caches and higher DRAM bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a higher level, GPU bandwidth demands have been a persistent challenge for large iGPUs and have driven a diverse set of solutions. Over a decade ago, Intel created “halo” iGPU variants and paired a 128 MB eDRAM cache while sticking with a typical 128-bit client memory bus. AMD’s console chips use large and fast DRAM buses. The PS5 is one example. Strix Halo does a bit of both. It combines modest cache capacity with a more DRAM bandwidth than typical client chips, but doesn’t rely as much on DRAM bandwidth as console chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those varied approaches to the bandwidth problem are fascinating. Watching how Infinity Cache behaves in various graphics workloads has been fascinating as well. But everything would be so much more fun if AMD’s tools provided direct data on Infinity Cache hitrates. That applies to both integrated and discrete GPUs. Infinity Cache is a well established part of AMD’s strategy. It has been around for several generations, and now has a presence in AMD’s mobile lineup too. I suspect developers would love to see Infinity Cache hitrates in addition to the data on GPU-private caches that AMD’s current tools show.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;French ex-president Sarkozy begins jail sentence for campaign finance conspiracy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first French ex-president to go to jail, as he starts a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain was jailed for treason in 1945 has any French ex-leader gone behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy, who was president from 2007-2012, has appealed against his jail term at La Santé prison, where he will occupy a small cell in the its isolation wing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 100 people applauded and shouted "Nicolas!" as he left his villa in the exclusive 16th district of Paris, holding his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy by the hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His son Louis, 28, had appealed to supporters for a show of support, while another son, Pierre, called for a message of love – "nothing else, please".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy, 70, was driven through the entrance of the notoriously overcrowded 19th-Century prison in the Montparnasse district south of the River Seine at 09:40 local time (07:40 GMT), while dozens of police officers cordoned off most of the surrounding streets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He continues to protest his innocence in the highly controversial Libyan money affair and posted a message on X as he was driven to the jail, saying: "I have no doubt. Truth will prevail. But how crushing the price will have been."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"With unwavering strength I tell [the French people] it is not a former president they are locking up this morning - it is an innocent man," he wrote. "Do not feel sorry for me because my wife and my children are by my side... but this morning I feel deep sorrow for a France humiliated by a will for revenge."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moments after Sarkozy entered jail, his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request for his release had been filed. Nothing justified his imprisonment, said Mr Ingrain, adding: "He'll be inside for at least three weeks or a month."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy has said he wants no special treatment at La Santé prison, although he has been put in its isolation section for his own safety as other inmates are infamous drugs dealers or have been convicted for terror offences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Small cell with TV, and one hour's daily exercise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy's cell in the prison's isolation wing is believed to be on the top floor and will measure between 9-11 sq m (95-120 sq ft). There had earlier been talk of him serving his term in another wing for "vulnerable people", where other VIPs have been jailed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He will have a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV, for which he will have to pay a monthly €14 (£12) fee, and the right to a small fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former president has the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits as well as written and phone contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he is in effect in solitary confinement, allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Conditions of detention in an isolation wing are pretty hard," La Santé ex-deputy head Flavie Rault told BFMTV. "You are alone, all the time. The only contact you have is with prison staff. You never come across another detainee for security reasons and there's a type of social isolation which makes life difficult".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of last week, Sarkozy was received at the Élysée Palace by President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Monday "it was normal that on a human level I should receive one of my predecessors in that context".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Macron stressed on Tuesday that it was not his role "to comment on or criticise judicial decisions", but he said it was normal that for many in France the sight of "a president jailed by this judicial decision would provoke comment".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a further measure of official support for the ex-president, Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said he would go to visit him in prison as part of his role in ensuring Sarkozy's safety and the proper functioning of the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I cannot be insensitive to a man's distress," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever since he left office in 2012, Sarkozy has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Late next month, France's highest administrative court will give its verdict on Sarkozy's appeal against a six-month jail term in another illegal campaign financing case known as the Bygmalion affair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahead of his arrival at La Santé prison, Sarkozy gave a series of media interviews, telling La Tribune: "I'm not afraid of prison. I'll keep my head held high, including at the prison gates."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy has always denied doing anything wrong in a case involving allegations that his 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of euros in Libyan cash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former centre-right leader was cleared of personally receiving the money but convicted of criminal association with two close aides, Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, for their role in secret campaign financing from the Libyans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two men both had talks with Gaddafi's intelligence chief and brother-in-law in 2005, a meeting arranged by a Franco-Lebanese intermediary called Ziad Tiakeddine, who died in Lebanon shortly before Sarkozy's conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As he lodged an appeal, Sarkozy is still considered innocent but he has been told he must go to jail in view of the "exceptional seriousness of the facts".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy said he would take two books with him into prison, a life of Jesus by Jean-Christian Petitfils and the Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas's classic story of a man wrongly imprisoned who escapes to wreak vengeance on his prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;API Key Authentication: Secure your knock endpoint with multiple, configurable API keys.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable TTL: Each API key can have its own Time-To-Live (TTL), defining how long a whitelisted IP remains active.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remote Whitelisting: Grant specific admin keys permission to whitelist any IP or CIDR range, not just their own.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Static IP/CIDR Whitelisting: Always allow certain IP addresses or ranges to bypass the dynamic whitelist.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Path-Based Exclusion: Exclude specific URL paths (like health checks or public APIs) from authentication entirely.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPv6 First-Class Citizen: Full support for IPv6 and IPv4 in whitelisting, trusted proxies, and Docker networking.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Firewalld Integration: Advanced firewall control with timed rules that automatically expire based on TTL. Creates dynamic firewall rules using firewalld rich rules for enhanced security. (Optional, requires root container access)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Knocker-Web Static PWA web app that supports knocking(whitelisting) on reload&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Knocker-CLI A cli written in go with support for background knocks optionally trigged by ip chanages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Knocker-EXPO An experimental Android App written in React EXPO with support for background knocking requests&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is designed to be deployed as a set of Docker containers using the provided &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file. It uses the pre-built docker images with support for AMD64, ARMv8 and ARMv7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker provides different image tags for different use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt;- Latest stable release (recommended for production)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;v1.2.3&lt;/code&gt;- Specific version tags (pinned versions)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;- Development branch (rolling updates, may be unstable)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Docker and Docker Compose installed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A public-facing server to run the containers (doesn't even have to be on the same server running the services! IN PROXY MODE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;(Optional) Firewalld 2.0+ installed and running on the host for advanced firewall integration.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Rename &lt;code&gt;knocker.example.yaml&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;knocker.yaml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Crucially, change the default API keys in &lt;code&gt;knocker.yaml&lt;/code&gt;to your own secure, random strings.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Review the &lt;code&gt;trusted_proxies&lt;/code&gt;list in&lt;code&gt;knocker.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, they should match the subnet of the reverse proxy's network (&lt;code&gt;docker network inspect xxx&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;(Optional) Configure firewalld integration by setting &lt;code&gt;firewalld.enabled: true&lt;/code&gt;and adjusting the related settings. Note: This requires the container to run as root.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rename &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run the Service:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;docker compose up -d&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will pull the pre-built&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;knocker&lt;/code&gt;image and start both the&lt;code&gt;knocker&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;caddy&lt;/code&gt;services.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker works by acting as an auth gateway for your reverse Proxy. It offers a verify endpoint, to check if the requesting IP is whitelisted or not, if not it will reply with a 401 and the reverse proxy will refuse the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caddy has the &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; directive to check connections using an auth endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define a Reusable Snippet: It's best practice to define a snippet in your&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Caddyfile&lt;/code&gt;for the auth check.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Protect Your Services: Import the snippet for any service you want to protect.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example &lt;code&gt;Caddyfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Caddyfile

# Define a reusable snippet for the knock-knock check.
# It points to the knocker service using Docker's internal DNS.
(knocker_auth) {
  forward_auth knocker:8000 {
    uri /verify
    copy_headers X-Forwarded-For
  }
}

# The public endpoint for performing the knock.
# Make sure this domain points to your Caddy server's IP.
knock.your-domain.com {
  reverse_proxy knocker:8000
}

# An example protected service.
jellyfin.your-domain.com {
  import knocker_auth  # Apply the forward_auth check
  reverse_proxy jellyfin_service_name:8096
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a user is not whitelisted, Caddy's &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; directive will return a &lt;code&gt;401 Unauthorized&lt;/code&gt; response with an empty body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important Note: Caddy's &lt;code&gt;handle_errors&lt;/code&gt; directive does not work with &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; responses. The error response comes directly from the authentication service (knocker), not from Caddy itself, so &lt;code&gt;handle_errors&lt;/code&gt; cannot intercept or modify these responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker provides advanced firewall integration through firewalld, creating dynamic, time-based firewall rules that automatically expire based on the TTL specified in knock requests. This feature operates at the network level, allowing you to use knocker for non-http services like ssh or game servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as User
    participant Firewall as Firewalld (knocker zone)
    participant Knocker
    participant Service as Protected Service (port 22)

    Note over Client,Firewall: Initial state — monitored port is blocked by default
    Client-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Firewall: TCP SYN to Service:22
    Firewall--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Client: DROP (no response)

    Note over Client,Knocker: User performs a knock to whitelist their IP
    Client-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: POST /knock (X-Api-Key, optional ip_address, ttl)
    Knocker-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: validate API key &amp;amp; determine client IP
    Knocker-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Firewall: add rich accept rule for client IP on port 22 with timeout
    Firewall--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: success

    Note over Firewall,Client: New rule overrides DROP due to higher priority
    Client-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Firewall: TCP SYN to Service:22
    Firewall-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Service: forward packet
    Service--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Client: TCP SYN-ACK (connection established)
    Knocker-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: update whitelist.json with expiry
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker requires FirewallD 2.0+ due to dependency on the zone priority feature. It's available in Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and other recent stable distros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FirewallD was chosen for the ability to separates the cli interface from the daemon. This allows Knocker to control firewalld from within a Docker container by mounting the system's D-Bus socket, and FirewallD also has support for timed rules, so knocker rules automatically expire by the end of the TTL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FIREWALLD WILL NOT WORK WITH DOCKER PUBLISHED PORTS, check this issue for more details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creates a dedicated firewalld zone with high priority&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adds DROP/REJECT rules for monitored ports to block unauthorized access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamically adds ALLOW rules for whitelisted IPs that override the blocking rules&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically expires rules based on TTL using firewalld's timeout mechanism&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recovers rules on startup by comparing whitelist.json with active firewalld rules&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;FirewallD 2.0+ installed and running on the host system&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Docker container must run as root for D-Bus access&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Configuration&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;enable FirewallD in the knocker.yaml config, settings are already available in the example config&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mount the Dbus socket into the docker container, and make sure it runs as root, the required entires are commented out in the docker-compose.yml file.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monitor active rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Check knocker zone
firewall-cmd --zone=knocker --list-all

# View rich rules
firewall-cmd --zone=knocker --list-rich-rules

# Monitor rule changes
journalctl -u firewalld -f&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For detailed configuration, architecture, and troubleshooting information, see the complete FirewallD Integration Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are enabling knocking for IPs behind tailscale or other IPs, you may face issues due to how userland-proxy works, you may get different request IP from the actual ip address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disabling Userland-proxy should fix it, but make sure to test your setup. You could also use host networking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This endpoint validates an API key and whitelists an IP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;To whitelist a remote IP/CIDR (requires &lt;code&gt;allow_remote_whitelist: true&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;{"ip_address": "YOUR_TARGET_IP_OR_CIDR"}&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To whitelist a remote IP/CIDR (requires &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Example (Whitelisting your own IP):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;curl -i -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY" https://knock.your-domain.com/knock&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success Response (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;{ "whitelisted_entry": "1.2.3.4", "expires_at": 1672534800, "expires_in_seconds": 3600 }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This endpoint is used by Caddy's &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; to check if the client's IP is whitelisted. It returns &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt; on success and &lt;code&gt;401 Unauthorized&lt;/code&gt; on failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project includes a full test suite&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run the tests locally:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install Dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;pip install -r src/requirements.txt&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Run Pytest:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;python3 -m pytest&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a dev environment under dev, with bash scripts for integrations tests with caddy and a separate one with firewalld. The CI runs the caddy tests, but firewalld needs a privileged runner, which is why it needs to be run locally and isn't a part of the CI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interactive documentation endpoints (&lt;code&gt;/docs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/redoc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/openapi.json&lt;/code&gt;) are disabled by default. To expose them, set the following in &lt;code&gt;knocker.yaml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;documentation:
  enabled: true
  openapi_output_path: "openapi.json"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When documentation is disabled (default), Knocker removes these endpoints and deletes any previously generated schema file to prevent stale artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a formal API specification and a summary of the architectural choices, please see the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker was fully vibe coded. The initial implementation was done with Gemini 2.5 pro, thanks to the tokens provided in the roo code/requesty hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further features were mostly done with the GitHub copilot Agent (sonnet 4/later 4.5), which needed a lot of fixes, done mostly by GPT-5 mini/CODEX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're Anti-AI please don't use this.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In Memoriam/gbnewby&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm very sad to announce that Dr. Gregory B. Newby (gbnewby) has died after a short battle with cancer. Dr. Newby was CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation for more than 20 years and, in that role, worked very closely with Distributed Proofreaders. He was also a voting member of the Distributed Proofreader Foundation board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Born in Canada, Dr. Newby grew up in the US. He returned to Canada, however, to work for the government in the Yukon Territory as he continued his direction of Project Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent interview, Greg described how he, a life-long reader, became excited about the possibilities of ebooks back in 1987 when someone emailed him a copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -- "I immediately realized what a tremendous thing that was." He cared deeply about Project Gutenberg's mission. "You know," he told the podcast interviewer, "That keeps me going ... having a positive impact and getting all that literature into people's hands."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Dr. Newby collaborated with Microsoft and MIT to produce the Project Gutenberg Open Audiobook Collection of AI-narrated audiobooks. This initiative was named one of "The Best Inventions of 2023" by TIME magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greg's vision saw the ebooks (many of them produced here at Distributed Proofreaders) made available through Project Gutenberg grow to more than 75,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Newby and his tireless leadership of Project Gutenberg was a close partner of Distributed Proofreaders and will be greatly missed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official announcement is here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial data centers are just on the horizon. Soon, an AI-equipped satellite from Starcloud, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, will orbit the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a large step toward the startup’s ultimate goal to bring state-of-the-art data centers to outer space. This can be a part of the solution to address challenges faced by rising AI demands, including energy consumption and cooling requirements for data centers on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In space, you get almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy,” said Philip Johnston, cofounder and CEO of the startup, which is based in Redmond, Washington. “The only cost on the environment will be on the launch, then there will be 10x carbon-dioxide savings over the life of the data center compared with powering the data center terrestrially on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starcloud’s upcoming satellite launch, planned for November, will mark the NVIDIA H100 GPU’s cosmic debut — and the first time a state-of-the-art, data center-class GPU is in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 60-kilogram Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small fridge, is expected to offer 100x more powerful GPU compute than any previous space-based operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on fresh water for cooling through evaporation towers, as many Earth-based data centers do, Starcloud’s space-based data centers can use the vacuum of deep space as an infinite heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emitting waste heat from infrared radiation into space can conserve significant water resources on Earth, since water isn’t needed for cooling. Constant exposure to the sun in orbit also means nearly infinite solar power — aka no need for the data centers to rely on batteries or backup power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starcloud projects the energy costs in space to be 10x cheaper than land-based options, even including launch expenses. “In 10 years, nearly all new data centers will be being built in outer space,” Johnston predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An early use case for extraterrestrial data centers is the analysis of Earth observation data, which could inform applications for detecting crop types and predicting local weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus, real-time data processing in space offers immense benefits for critical applications such as wildfire detection and distress-signal response. Running inference in space, right where the data’s collected, allows insights to be delivered nearly instantaneously, reducing response times from hours to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earth observation methods include optical imaging with cameras, hyperspectral imaging using light wavelengths beyond human vision and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging to build high-resolution, 3D maps of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SAR, in particular, generates lots of data — about 10 gigabytes per second, according to Johnston — so in-space inference would be especially beneficial when creating these maps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Starcloud needs to be competitive with the type of workload you can run on an Earth-based data center, and NVIDIA GPUs are the most performant in terms of training, fine-tuning and inference,” Johnston said, explaining why the company chose to use NVIDIA accelerated computing on its upcoming satellite launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Being a part of NVIDIA Inception has been critical, as it provided us with technical support, access to NVIDIA experts and NVIDIA GPUs,” Johnston added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starcloud is a recent graduate of the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator plans to run Gemma — an open model from Google — in orbit on H100 GPUs, proving even large language models can run in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for future launches, the startup is looking to integrate the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, which Johnston expects will offer even greater in-orbit AI performance, with improvements of up to 10x compared with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Shift FinOps Left: Proactively Find &amp;amp; Fix Cloud Cost Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overview&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spend on public cloud is fast approaching $1 trillion per year - we estimate this boundary will be crossed before the turn of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g. Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK) and platform engineering have fundamentally changed who makes spending decisions. In the past, only a central team provisioned cloud resources. Now every engineer can provision resources as needed; every engineer has become a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infracost helps engineers see the cost of their code changes before any money has been spent - we sit in the engineering workflow, show the cost impact, and suggest optimizations. That’s what we mean by “Shift FinOps Left”, and we’ve seen strong pull from engineers who use Infracost in their terminals, CI/CD pipelines and IDEs. The Infracost CLI repo has 12K stars on GitHub! There’s a massive opportunity to help organizations proactively manage their cloud spend; rather than reacting to surprise cost spikes after the fact. We know reactive is too late; we saw that firsthand with our first startup a decade ago, and we’re building Infracost to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring our first Developer Advocate to help more engineers discover and fall in love with Infracost. Your mission is simple: increase signups by showing DevOps, SRE, Platform, and Infrastructure engineers the value of Infracost in the channels and workflows they already use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll work closely with our Developer Adoption product engineering team, which is focused on DX: CLI, VS Code &amp;amp; JetBrains extensions, MCP server, Copilot integrations…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Timezone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US or EU timezones (our engineering team is based between GMT -6 and GMT+2). We are fully remote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we value&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll get to meet all 3 co-founders, so bring your questions 😃&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since launching Infracost in 2021, we’ve been pulled by engineers who all want to Shift FinOps Left. We enable them to proactively find and fix cloud cost issues before they hit production. We plug directly into developer workflows (like GitHub and Azure Repos), show cost impact in pull requests, enforce tagging and FinOps best practices, and even generate PRs to fix issues automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're backed by Sequoia, YC and trusted by Fortune 500 enterprises. You'll join a small, experienced, and supportive team that's shipping fast, solving real infrastructure problems, and having fun while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click. Ugh. Another one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know the drill. You land on a new website, eager to read an article or check a product price, and before the page even finishes loading, it appears: the dreaded cookie banner. A pop-up, a slide-in, a full-screen overlay demanding you "Accept All," "Manage Preferences," or navigate a labyrinth of toggles designed by a corporate lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people do the same thing: they sigh, their eyes glaze over, and they click "Accept All" with the muscle memory of a weary soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This daily ritual of digital whack-a-mole is the result of well-intentioned privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. The goal was noble: to give users control over their data. But the execution? It's a colossal failure. It has created a web experience that is more annoying, less transparent, and arguably no more private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem isn't the what. It's the where. The law placed the burden of consent on millions of individual websites, when it should have targeted the one tool we all use to access them: the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Insanity of the Status Quo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if every time you got into your car, you had to manually approve the engine's use of oil, the tires' use of air, and the radio's use of electricity. It’s absurd, right? You’d set your preferences once, and the car would just work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, that’s exactly what we do online. We are asked the same questions, by every single website, every single day. This approach is broken for three simple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consent Fatigue is Real: We're so bombarded with these requests that they’ve become meaningless. The banners are an obstacle to be cleared, not a choice to be considered. True consent requires a conscious, informed decision, not an exasperated click to get the pop-up out of the way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It Punishes the Little Guys: A giant corporation can afford a team of lawyers and expensive Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) to create a compliant (and often deliberately confusing) banner. But what about the small blogger, the local restaurant, or the indie developer? For them, it's another technical and legal headache, forcing them to install clunky, site-slowing plugins just to avoid a potential lawsuit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It Doesn't Actually Give Us Control: The illusion of choice is not choice. When the options are "Accept All" or "Spend Five Minutes in a Menu of Legalese," the system is designed to push you toward the path of least resistance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Simple, Radical Idea: Put Consent in the Browser&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine a different internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you set up your browser—be it Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge—you go through a simple, one-time setup. It asks for your privacy preferences in plain English:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you want to handle your data?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Essential Only: "Only allow data necessary for websites to function (e.g., keeping me logged in, remembering my shopping cart)."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Analytics: "Help creators improve their sites by letting them see anonymous data about how I use them."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Personalized Experience: "Allow sites to use my data for personalized content and relevant advertising."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom: Fine-tune your settings for specific data types.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You make your choice once. Set it and forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From that moment on, the responsibility shifts. Your browser becomes your personal privacy enforcer, and the law would require it to act on your behalf. Based on your one-time choice, it would be responsible for allowing or declining cookies from every site you visit. If a website tries to use a cookie with an unclear or undeclared purpose? The browser simply blocks it—no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The World We Could Have&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This browser-centric model would fix everything that’s wrong with the current system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Users: Real Control &amp;amp; A Cleaner Web. Your choice would be meaningful because you’d make it once, thoughtfully. The result? A faster, cleaner, and radically less annoying internet experience. You could easily review or change your global settings at any time, right in your browser.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Website Owners: A Massive Burden Lifted. Suddenly, millions of developers, creators, and small business owners are freed from the role of digital janitor. They no longer need to install ugly, performance-killing scripts. Compliance becomes automatic. The web becomes more accessible and innovative.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Regulators: Easier Enforcement. Instead of trying to police millions of websites, regulators could focus on a handful of major browser developers. Are they implementing the standard correctly? Are they honoring the user's choice? It’s a much more efficient and effective system.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From a Tangled Mess to a Simple Signal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some might call this a radical change, but the truly radical thing is the convoluted system we've accepted as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, the internet runs on a fragile, sprawling patchwork of compliance tools. Think about the sheer absurdity of it. Every individual website owner is forced to bolt on a third-party Consent Management Platform (CMP). That platform must then be perfectly configured to talk to dozens of different ad-tech vendors, analytics scripts, and embedded services. All of this has to work flawlessly while navigating the subtle legal differences between GDPR, CCPA, and a growing list of other regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an ecosystem where countless platforms are all trying to talk to each other, duplicating effort and overcomplicating the simple act of a user saying "yes" or "no." We've built a million different, shaky bridges to solve a problem that requires only one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser-based approach cuts through this entire tangled web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It replaces millions of individual, often-conflicting systems with one, single source of truth: your browser. Your choice becomes a clear, unambiguous signal sent to every site you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t about building a new, complex system. It’s about dismantling a monstrously inefficient one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s about freeing developers and small businesses from being amateur privacy lawyers. It’s about creating a standard that is clear for users, simple for creators, and effective for regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's time to take the consent dialog out of the websites we visit and put it where it always belonged: in our hands, via our browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The hack of Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), cost the British economy an estimated 1.9 billion pounds ($2.55 billion) and affected over 5,000 organisations, an independent cybersecurity body said in a report published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report was produced by the Cyber Monitoring Centre, an independent, not for profit organisation made up of industry specialists, including the former head of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It said losses could be higher if there were unexpected delays to the restoration of production at the vehicle manufacturer to levels before the hack took place in August.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This incident appears to be the most economically damaging cyber event to hit the UK, with the vast majority of the financial impact being due to the loss of manufacturing output at JLR and its suppliers," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JLR will report its financial results in November, according to the company's website. A spokesperson for JLR declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company started to resume manufacturing earlier this month after an almost six-week shutdown caused by the hack. The luxury carmaker has three factories in Britain that together produce about 1,000 cars per day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The incident was one of several high-profile hacks to affect major British companies this year. Retailer Marks &amp;amp; Spencer (MKS.L) lost about 300 million pounds (about $400 million) after a breach in April shut down its online services for two months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JLR, which analysts estimated was losing around 50 million pounds per week from the shutdown, was provided with a 1.5 billion pound loan guarantee by the British government in late September to help it support suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CMC, which is funded by the insurance industry and categorises the financial impact of major cybersecurity incidents affecting British businesses, ranked the JLR hack as a Category 3 systemic event, out of a scale of five.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CMC's estimate "reflects the substantial disruption to JLR's manufacturing, to its multi-tier manufacturing supply chain, and to downstream organisations including dealerships," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7451 pounds)&lt;/p&gt;
