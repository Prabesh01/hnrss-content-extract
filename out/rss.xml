    &lt;p&gt;Ramp for Real Estate&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goldbridge is building the financial operating system for the largest asset class in the world – real estate. More than $1T in rent flows through landlord bank accounts annually, with roughly a quarter locked in idle reserves and security deposits – and billions more leaking from unnecessary property expenses. And with $2.5T in real estate loans about to mature in 2027/28, property owners are desperate to boost their income ASAP. Goldbridge solves this problem by creating the first AI-powered banking platform for real estate owners. We are backed by Y Combinator and other world-class investors, and our CEO is a 2x YC founder, former White House advisor, and 100-unit real estate owner/operator who understands this industry deeply.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took Android devicemakers a very long time to commit to long-term update support. Samsung and Google have only recently decided to offer seven years of updates for their flagship Android devices, but a decade ago, you were lucky to get more than one or two updates on even the most expensive Android phones and tablets. How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia released the first Shield Android TV in 2015, and according to the company’s senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love. And the team at Nvidia still loves the Shield. Bell assures us that Nvidia has never given up, even when it looked like support for the Shield was waning, and it doesn’t plan to stop any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The soul of Shield&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming has been central to Nvidia since its start, and that focus gave rise to the Shield. “Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,” said Bell, who has worked at the company for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Nvidia didn’t have what it needed back then. Before gaming, crypto, and AI turned it into the multi-trillion-dollar powerhouse it is today, Nvidia had a startup mentality and the budget to match. When Shield devices began percolating in the company’s labs, it was seen as an important way to gain experience with “full-stack” systems and all the complications that arise when managing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To build a game console was pretty complicated because, of course, you have to have a GPU, which we know how to make,” Bell explained. “But in addition to that, you need a CPU, an OS, games, and you need a UI.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lunch break at the Finnish International School of Tampere (FISTA) is a boisterous time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The yard is filled with children — ranging from grades 1 to 9, or ages 6 to 16 — running around, shouting, playing football, shooting basketball hoops, doing what kids do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there's not a single screen in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FISTA has taken advantage of the law change, brought in last August, which allows schools to restrict or completely ban the use of mobile phones during school hours. At FISTA, this means no phones at all unless specifically used for learning in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We've seen that cutting down on the possibilities for students to use their phones, during the breaks for instance, has spurred a lot of creativity," FISTA vice principal Antti Koivisto notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They're more active, doing more physical things like playing games outdoors or taking part in the organised break activities or just socialising with each other."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the smartphone restriction in schools widely considered to have been a success, Finland's government has now set its sights on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP) said earlier this month that he supports banning the use of social media by children under the age of 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I am deeply concerned about the lack of physical activity among children and young people, and the fact that it is increasing," Orpo said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there is a growing groundswell of support for Finland introducing such a ban. Two-thirds of respondents to a survey published earlier this week said they back a ban on social media for under-15s. This is a near 10 percentage point jump compared to a similar survey carried out just last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;"Uncontrolled human experiment"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concerns over social media, and in particular the effects on children, have been well-documented — but Finnish researcher Silja Kosola's recent description of the phenomenon as an "uncontrolled human experiment" has grabbed people's attention once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kosola, an associate professor in adolescent medicine, has researched the impact of social media on young people, and tells Yle News that the consequences are not very well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We see a rise in self-harm and especially eating disorders. We see a big separation in the values of young girls and boys, which is also a big problem in society," Kosola explains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the video below, Silja Kosola explains the detrimental effects that excessive use of social media can have on young people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She further notes that certain aspects of Finnish culture — such as the independence and freedom granted to children from a young age — have unwittingly exacerbated the ill effects of social media use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We have given smartphones to younger people more than anywhere else in the world. Just a couple of years ago, about 95 percent of first graders had their own smartphone, and that hasn't happened anywhere else," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;All eyes on Australia&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 10 December last year, children under the age of 16 in Australia have been banned from using social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began drafting the legislation after he received a heartfelt letter from a grieving mother who lost her 12-year-old daughter to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Albanese has never revealed the details of the letter, he told public broadcaster ABC that it was "obvious social media had played a key role" in the young girl's death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legislation aims to shift the burden away from parents and children and onto the social media companies, who face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (29 million euros) if they consistently fail to keep kids off their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clare Armstrong, ABC's chief digital political correspondent, told Yle News that the initial reaction to the roll-out has been some confusion but no little "relief".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The government often talks about this law as being a tool to help parents and other institutions enforce and start conversations about tech and social media in ways that before, they couldn't," she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although it is still early days, as the ban has only been in force for about six weeks, Armstrong adds that the early indicators have been good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ABC journalist Clare Armstrong explains in the video below how children in Australia have been spending their time since the social media ban was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, she adds a note of caution to any countries — such as Finland — looking to emulate the Australian model, noting that communication is key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Because you can write a very good law, but if the public doesn't understand it, and if it can't be enforced at that household level easily, then it's bound to fail," Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Playing to Finland's strengths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seona Candy, an Australian living in Helsinki for over eight years, has been keenly following the events in her homeland since the social media ban came into effect in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She has heard anecdotally that if kids find themselves blocked from one platform, they just set up an account on another, "ones that maybe their parents don't even know exist".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And this is then much, much harder, because those platforms don't have parental controls, so they don't have those things already designed into them that the more mainstream platforms do," Candy says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this issue, and others she has heard about, she warns against Finland introducing like-for-like legislation based around Australia's "reactive, knee-jerk" law change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think the Finnish government should really invest in digital education, and digital literacy, and teach kids about digital safety. Finland is world-famous for education, and for media literacy. Play to your strengths, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The All Points North podcast asked if Finland should introduce a similar ban on social media as in Australia. You can listen to the episode via this embedded player, on Yle Areena, via Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mobile carriers can get your GPS location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In iOS 26.3, Apple introduced a new privacy feature which limits “precise location” data made available to cellular networks via cell towers. The feature is only available to devices with Apple’s in-house modem introduced in 2025. The announcement1 says&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cellular networks can determine your location based on which cell towers your device connects to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is well-known. I have served on a jury where the prosecution obtained location data from cell towers. Since cell towers are sparse (especially before 5G), the accuracy is in the range of tens to hundreds of metres2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is not the whole truth, because cellular standards have built-in protocols that make your device silently send GNSS (i.e. GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) location to the carrier. This would have the same precision as what you see in your Map apps, in single-digit metres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2G and 3G this is called Radio Resources LCS Protocol (RRLP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So the network simply asks “tell me your GPS coordinates if you know them” and the phone will respond3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 4G and 5G this is called LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RRLP, RRC, and LPP are natively control-plane positioning protocols. This means that they are transported in the inner workings of cellular networks and are practically invisible to end users4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that GNSS location is never meant to leave your device. GNSS coordinates are calculated entirely passively, your device doesn’t need to send a single bit of information. Using GNSS is like finding out where you are by reading a road sign: you don’t have to tell anyone else you read a road sign, anyone can read a road sign, and the people who put up road signs don’t know who read which road sign when.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These capabilities are not secrets but somehow they have mostly slid under the radar of the public consciousness. They have been used in the wild for a long time, such as by the DEA in the US in 200656:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[T]he DEA agents procured a court order (but not a search warrant) to obtain GPS coordinates from the courier’s phone via a ping, or signal requesting those coordinates, sent by the phone company to the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And by Shin Bet in Israel, which tracks everyone everywhere all the time7:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The GSS Tool was based on centralized cellular tracking operated by Israel’s General Security Services (GSS). The technology was based on a framework that tracks all the cellular phones running in Israel through the cellular companies’ data centers. According to news sources, it routinely collects information from cellular companies and identifies the location of all phones through cellular antenna triangulation and GPS data7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, the Israeli government started using the data for contact tracing in March 202078, only a few weeks after the first Israeli COVID-19 case. An individual would be sent an SMS message informing them of close contact with a COVID patient and required to quarantine. This is good evidence that the location data Israeli carriers are collecting are far more precise than what cell towers alone can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A major caveat is that I don’t know if RRLP and LPP are the exact techniques, and the only techniques, used by DEA, Shin Bet, and possibly others to collect GNSS data; there could be other protocols or backdoors we’re not privy to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another unknown is whether these protocols can be exploited remotely by a foreign carrier. Saudi Arabia has abused SS7 to spy on people in the US9, but as far as I know this only locates a device to the coverage area of a Mobile Switching Center, which is less precise than cell tower data. Nonetheless, given the abysmal culture, competency, and integrity in the telecom industry, I would not be shocked if it’s possible for a state actor to obtain the precise GNSS coordinates of anyone on earth using a phone number/IMEI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple made a good step in iOS 26.3 to limit at least one vector of mass surveillance, enabled by having full control of the modem silicon and firmware. They must now allow users to disable GNSS location responses to mobile carriers, and notify the user when such attempts are made to their device.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I built a scriptable 3D game engine for the Nintendo DS so you can write and run games directly on the console itself. Written in C using libnds, it compiles to a ~100KB .nds ROM that runs at 60 FPS. Features a touch-based code editor on the bottom screen and real-time 3D rendering on the top screen. Ships with a working 3D pong game as the default script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt nostalgic for when I made my first games on an old TI-82 graphing calculator. So I tried bringing that whole experience to my Nintendo DS. A complete programming environment you can hold in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you see is a scriptable game engine with a custom programming language featuring variables, loops, and conditionals. You write code using the bottom touchscreen, click play, and the game will execute in real-time on the top screen with full 3D rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the engine breaks down into three parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uses the DS's 3D hardware to render colored cubes at 60 FPS. Each model has position (X, Y, Z), rotation angle, and color. The camera is fully controllable with position and yaw/pitch angles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// DS 3D rendering code (C + libnds) glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW); glLoadIdentity(); gluLookAt(camX, camY, camZ, // camera position camX + lookX, camY + lookY, camZ + lookZ, // look target 0, 1, 0); // up vector&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each model is drawn with a transform (position + Y-axis rotation), then the cube geometry: one color, six quads (24 vertices).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Per-model draw calls (from main.c) for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; MAX_MODELS; i++) { if (!modelActive[i]) continue; glPushMatrix(); glTranslatef(modelX[i], modelY[i], modelZ[i]); glRotatef(modelAngle[i], 0, 1, 0); drawCube(CUBE_COLORS[modelColorIndex[i]]); drawWireframeCube(); glPopMatrix(1); } // Cube geometry: RGB15 color -&amp;gt; glColor3b, then 6 faces as GL_QUADS glColor3b(r * 255/31, g * 255/31, b * 255/31); glBegin(GL_QUADS); /* +Z face */ glVertex3f(-1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f( 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f( 1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f); glVertex3f(-1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f); /* -Z, +Y, -Y, +X, -X ... (24 vertices total) */ glEnd();&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A touch-based code editor with a custom UI drawn pixel-by-pixel to a 256x192 bitmap. Features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Software rendering to bottom screen u16 *subBuffer = (u16*)BG_BMP_RAM_SUB(0); // 256x192 framebuffer subBuffer[y * 256 + x] = RGB15(31, 31, 31); // white pixel&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executes one line of script per frame (~60 lines/sec). Scripts can use 26 variables (A-Z) plus 9 read-only registers for input (D-pad, buttons) and system state (elapsed time, camera direction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// Script execution (simplified) if (tokenEquals(script[scriptIP], "add")) { int r = scriptReg[scriptIP]; // which register (A-Z) registers[r] += getNumberParamValue(scriptIP, 0); scriptIP++; // next line }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scripts are built from tokens (commands) with numeric parameters. Each line executes instantly, with no parsing overhead, just a series of if-checks against token names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variables &amp;amp; Math&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SET A 5&lt;/code&gt; — set register A to 5&lt;code&gt;ADD A 1&lt;/code&gt; — add 1 to A&lt;code&gt;SUBTRACT A 2&lt;/code&gt; — subtract 2 from A&lt;code&gt;MULTIPLY B -1&lt;/code&gt; — multiply B by -1&lt;p&gt;Control Flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOOP&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;END_LOOP&lt;/code&gt; — infinite loop&lt;code&gt;IF_GT A 10&lt;/code&gt; — if A &amp;gt; 10&lt;code&gt;IF_LT A 0&lt;/code&gt; — if A &amp;lt; 0&lt;code&gt;IF_TRUE kA&lt;/code&gt; — if A button pressed&lt;code&gt;END_IF&lt;/code&gt; — close conditional&lt;p&gt;3D Objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MODEL 0&lt;/code&gt; — create model at index 0&lt;code&gt;POSITION 0 X Y Z&lt;/code&gt; — set position&lt;code&gt;ANGLE 0 45&lt;/code&gt; — set rotation angle&lt;code&gt;NEXT_COLOR 0&lt;/code&gt; — cycle color&lt;p&gt;Camera &amp;amp; Rendering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAM_POS X Y Z&lt;/code&gt; — set camera position&lt;code&gt;CAM_ANGLE yaw pitch&lt;/code&gt; — set look direction&lt;code&gt;BACKGROUND 2&lt;/code&gt; — set bg color (0-3)&lt;code&gt;BEEP&lt;/code&gt; — play 0.1s sound&lt;code&gt;SLEEP 0.016&lt;/code&gt; — pause (60 FPS = 0.016s/frame)&lt;code&gt;LEFT, UP, RGT, DN&lt;/code&gt;: D-pad (1.0 when held, 0.0 when released)
&lt;code&gt;KA, KB&lt;/code&gt;: A and B buttons&lt;code&gt;TIME&lt;/code&gt;: elapsed seconds since script started&lt;code&gt;LOOKX, LOOKZ&lt;/code&gt;: camera forward direction (normalized X and Z)
&lt;p&gt;The engine ships with a playable pong game. Here's a simplified excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;MODEL 0 ; create ball MODEL 1 ; create paddle CAM_POS 0 8 18 ; position camera SET A 0 ; ball X position SET B 1 ; ball velocity SET C 0 ; paddle Z position LOOP ADD A B ; move ball IF_GT A 10 ; hit right wall? MULTIPLY B -1 ; reverse velocity END_IF IF_TRUE Up ; up button pressed? ADD C -0.5 ; move paddle up END_IF POSITION 0 A 0 0 ; update ball position POSITION 1 -13 0 C ; update paddle position SLEEP 0.016 ; ~60 FPS END_LOOP&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full script includes collision detection, game-over logic, and beep sounds on miss, all done with simple register math and conditionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; in the project directory
&lt;code&gt;program.nds&lt;/code&gt; (~100 KB ROM file)
&lt;p&gt;You need a flashcart (e.g. R4, DSTT, Acekard) with a microSD card:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;program.nds&lt;/code&gt; to the microSD card
&lt;p&gt;Note: I got my R4 cart + SD card from a friend years ago, so I don't have detailed setup instructions for the cart itself. Most modern flashcarts just need you to copy their firmware to the SD root, then add ROMs in a folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can test the DS game engine build directly below. The emulator loads &lt;code&gt;ds-game-engine.nds&lt;/code&gt;. Loads a more basic pong game than the one in the video.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo DS emulator (Desmond). If the game doesn’t start, ensure JavaScript is enabled and the page has finished loading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiled ROM (ds-game-engine.nds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask or discuss in this Reddit thread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Germans love their potatoes. They eat on average 63kg a person every year, according to official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the exceptional glut of potatoes produced by farmers during the last harvest has overwhelmed even the hardiest of fans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Named the Kartoffel-Flut (potato flood), after the highest yield in 25 years, the bumper crop has inspired one farmer to organise a potato dump on Berlin, with appeals going out around the German capital for people to come to various hotspots and pick them up for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, kindergartens, schools, churches and non-profit organisations are among those to have taken their fill. Even Berlin zoo has participated in the “rescue mission”, taking tonnes of potatoes that would otherwise have gone to landfill, or to produce biogas, to feed its animals. Two lorry loads have been sent to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ordinary city residents, many feeling the squeeze over the rise in the cost of living, have arrived at pre-announced potato dump locations, filling up anything from sacks and buckets to handcarts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Astrid Marz queued recently in Kaulsdorf, on the eastern edge of Berlin, one of 174 distribution points spontaneously set up around the city, to stuff an old rucksack with spuds. “I stopped counting at 150. I think I’ve got enough to keep me and my neighbours going until the end of the year,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operation, called 4000 Tonnes after the surplus a single potato farmer near Leipzig offered in December after a sale fell through at the last minute, was organised by a Berlin newspaper with the Berlin-based eco-friendly not-for-profit search engine Ecosia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At first I thought it was some AI-generated fake news when I saw it on social media,” Marz, a teacher, said. “There were pictures of huge mountains of ‘earth apples’,” she recalled, using the word Erdäpfel, an affectionate term for the potato sometimes used by Berliners, “with the instruction to come and get them for free!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The excitement has lifted spirits at a time when arctic cold has Berlin in its grip, hampering travel, grinding public transport to a halt and leaving pavements hazardously icy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There was a really party-like atmosphere,” said Ronald, describing how people cheerily helped one other with heavy loads and swapped culinary tips when he recently picked up potatoes for his family at the Tempelhofer Feld.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result of the buzz, the potato is receiving something of a new lease of life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has helped resurrect stories about how the humble tuber first became popular in Germany, after Prussia’s Frederick II issued an order for its cultivation in the 18th century, known as the Kartoffelbefehl (potato decree), establishing it as a staple food despite reported initial scepticism over its strange texture and form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recipes galore are being shared online as those who have scooped up the spuds try to work out what to do with the surfeit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the potato has sometimes been spurned in recent years as some fitness gurus have recommended avoiding carbohydrates, experts have highlighted its nutritional properties, such as vitamin C and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Celebrity Berlin chef Marco Müller of the Rutz restaurant has said now is the ideal moment to give the potato the Michelin-star treatment. He uses an innovative technique to make a rich broth from roasted potato peelings and a sought-after potato vinaigrette.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another of the recipes doing the rounds is Angela Merkel’s Kartoffelsuppe (potato soup), which the former German chancellor first shared with voters in the run-up to 2017’s general election in an interview with a celebrity magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her hot pot tip? To give it the necessary lumpy texture, she revealed: “I always pound the potatoes myself with a potato masher, rather than using a food mixer.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Criticism has come from farmers in the region, who say the market in Berlin is even more saturated and their crop has been devalued further still by the vast giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More widely, environmental lobbyists have said the glut in part stems from a warped and out-of-control food industry, and that the mountains of potatoes pictured in storage facilities across the region is reminiscent of the notorious butter mountains and milk lakes of the 1970s, when farmers were overly incentivised to produce food owing to the European Economic Community’s guarantee to buy up surplus products at high prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it’s the potato’s turn this year, last year hops were in surplus and next year, it is predicted, it will be milk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A last hoorah for the intervention is expected in the coming days, and those keen to participate in the potato party are urged to keep a close eye on the organisers’ website for the next drops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, in theory, about 3,200 tonnes (3,200,000kg or 7,056,000lbs) still up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pass security audits and compliance requirements (SOC2, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce attack surface with minimal, distroless images&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get CVE patches within 24-48 hours of disclosure (vs weeks for Debian/Ubuntu)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cryptographically signed images with full SBOM for supply chain security&lt;/item&gt;

While modern architectures like ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) introduce dedicated hardware for matrix operations, existing linear algebra libraries fail to fully exploit its potential, particularly for large matrices. This paper presents MpGEMM, an open-source library that leverages key architectural features of SME to optimize GEMM across multiple precisions. Through a systematic characterization of SME, we derive optimization guidelines that inform our design. MpGEMM employs cache-aware partitioning, efficient data packing with on-the-fly transposition, and specialized micro-kernels that utilize multi-vector loads and all available tile registers. Evaluated on an Apple M4 Pro with real-world workloads from DeepSeek and LLaMA, MpGEMM achieves an average speedup of 1.23x over the vendor-optimized Apple Accelerate library and significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I have been developing a new reporting application. Early on, I decided to add a –dry-run option to the run command. This turned out to be quite useful – I have used it many times a day while developing and testing the application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application will generate a set of reports every weekday. It has a loop that checks periodically if it is time to generate new reports. If so, it will read data from a database, apply some logic to create the reports, zip the reports, upload them to an sftp server, check for error responses on the sftp server, parse the error responses, and send out notification mails. The files (the generated reports, and the downloaded feedback files) are moved to different directories depending on the step in the process. A simple and straightforward application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in the development process, when testing the incomplete application, I remembered that Subversion (the version control system after CVS, before Git) had a –dry-run option. Other linux commands have this option too. If a command is run with the argument –dry-run, the output will print what will happen when the command is run, but no changes will be made. This lets the user see what will happen if the command is run without the –dry-run argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remembered how helpful that was, so I decided to add it to my command as well. When I run the command with –dry-run, it prints out the steps that will be taken in each phase: which reports that will be generated (and which will not be), which files will be zipped and moved, which files will be uploaded to the sftp server, and which files will be downloaded from it (it logs on and lists the files).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back at the project, I realized that I ended up using the –dry-run option pretty much every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am surprised how useful I found it to be. I often used it as a check before getting started. Since I know –dry-run will not change anything, it is safe to run without thinking. I can immediately see that everything is accessible, that the configuration is correct, and that the state is as expected. It is a quick and easy sanity check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also used it quite a bit when testing the complete system. For example, if I changed a date in the report state file (the date for the last successful report of a given type), I could immediately see from the output whether it would now be generated or not. Without –dry-run, the actual report would also be generated, which takes some time. So I can test the behavior, and receive very quick feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Downside&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The downside is that the dryRun-flag pollutes the code a bit. In all the major phases, I need to check if the flag is set, and only print the action that will be taken, but not actually doing it. However, this doesn’t go very deep. For example, none of the code that actually generates the report needs to check it. I only need to check if that code should be invoked in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type of application I have been writing is ideal for –dry-run. It is invoked by a command, and it may create some changes, for example generating new reports. More reactive applications (that wait for messages before acting) don’t seem to be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I added –dry-run on a whim early on in the project. I was surprised at how useful I found it to be. Adding it early was also good, since I got the benefit of it while developing more functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The –dry-run flag is not for every situation, but when it fits, it can be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Automating consumer debt collection with AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CollectWise is a fast growing and well funded Y Combinator-backed startup. We’re using generative AI to automate debt collection, a $35B market in the US alone. Our AI agents are already outperforming human collectors by 2X, and we’re doing so at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a team of three, we scaled to a $1 million annualized run rate in just a few months, and we are now hiring an AI Agent Engineer to help us reach $10 million within the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are hiring an AI Agent Engineer to design, optimize, and productionize the prompting and conversation logic behind our voice AI agents, while also supporting the technical systems that power customer deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll work at the intersection of AI quality, product outcomes, and engineering execution—owning prompt development, testing, and iteration loops that improve real-world performance (e.g., identity verification, payment conversion, dispute handling, containment rates), while collaborating closely with the founder and customers to ship improvements quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role is ideal if you’re highly analytical and business minded, love experimentation and measurement, and can also jump into back-end code and integrations when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Desired Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compensation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CollectWise is revolutionizing debt recovery with autonomous AI agents and an integrated legal network. We boost recovery rates, reduce costs, and maintain a positive brand image through respectful, data-driven interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outsourcing thinking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a note to the reader: This blog post is longer than usual, as I decided to address multiple connected issues in the same post, without being too restrictive on length. With modern browsing habits and the amount of available online media, I suspect this post will be quickly passed over in favor of more interesting reading material. Before you immediately close this tab, I invite you to scroll down and read the conclusion, which hopefully can give you some food for thought along the way. If, however, you manage to read the whole thing, I applaud your impressive attention span.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common criticism of the use of large language models (LLMs) is that it can deprive us of cognitive skills. The typical argument is that outsourcing certain tasks can easily cause some kind of mental atrophy. To what extent this is true is an ongoing discussion among neuroscientists, psychologists and others, but to me, the understanding that with certain skills you have to "use it or lose it" seems intuitively and empirically sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more relevant question is whether certain kinds of use are better or worse than others, and if so, which? In the blog post The lump of cognition fallacy, Andy Masley discusses this in detail. His entry point to the problem is to challenge the idea that "there is a fixed amount of thinking to do", and how it leads people to the conclusion that "outsourcing thinking" to chatbots will make us lazy, less intelligent, or in other ways be negative for our cognitive abilities. He compares this to the misconception that there is only a finite amount of work that needs to be done in an economy, which often is referred to as "the lump of labour fallacy". His viewpoint is that "thinking often leads to more things to think about", and therefore we shouldn't worry about letting machines do the thinking for us — we will simply be able to think about other things instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading Masley's blog post prompted me to write down my own thoughts on the matter, as it has been churning in my mind for a long time. I realized that it could be constructive to use his blog post as a reference and starting point, because it contains arguments that are often brought up in this discussion. I will use some examples from Masley's post to show how I think differently about this, but I'll extend the scope beyond the claimed fallacy that there is a limited amount of thinking to be done. I have done my best to write this text in a way that does not require reading Masley's post first. My aim is not to refute all of his arguments, but to explain why the issue is much more complicated than "thinking often leads to more things to think about". Overall, the point of this post is to highlight some critical issues with "outsourcing thinking".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When should we avoid using generative language models?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to define categories of activities where the use of LLMs (typically in the form of chatbots) is more harmful than helpful? Masley lists certain cases where, in his view, it is obviously detrimental to outsource thinking. To fully describe my own perspective, I'll take the liberty to quote the items on his list. He writes it's "bad to outsource your cognition when it:"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Builds complex tacit knowledge you'll need for navigating the world in the future.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is an expression of care and presence for someone else.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is a valuable experience on its own.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is deceptive to fake.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is focused in a problem that is deathly important to get right, and where you don't totally trust who you're outsourcing it to.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was surprised to discover that we are to a large extent in agreement on this list, despite having fundamentally different views otherwise. The disagreement lies, I believe, in the amount of activities that fall within the categories outlined above, particularly three of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Personal communication and writing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with the point "Is deceptive to fake". Masley uses the example of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If someone’s messaging you on a dating app, they want to know what you’re actually like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very true, but in my view, it's not only in such intimate or private situations where it is deceptive to fake what you are like. Personal communication in general is an area where it matters how we express ourselves, both for ourselves and those we talk or write to. When we communicate with each other, there are certain expectations framing the whole exchange. Letting our words and phrases be transformed by a machine is a breach of those expectations. The words we choose and how we formulate our sentences carry a lot of meaning, and direct communication will suffer if we let language models pollute this type of interaction. Direct communication is not only about the information being exchanged, it's also about the relationship between the communicators, formed by who we are and how we express ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is not only relevant for communication between two humans, but also for text with a personal sender conveyed to a human audience in general. To a certain extent, the same principles apply. There has been a debate in the Norwegian media lately regarding the undisclosed use of LLMs in public writing, with allegations and opinions flying around. I'm very happy to see this discussion reaching broad daylight, because we need to clarify our expectations to communication, now that chatbots are being so widely used. While I clearly think that it is beneficial to keep human-to-human communication free from an intermediate step of machine transformation, not everyone shares that view. If, going forward, our written communication will for the most part be co-authored with AI models, we need to be aware of it, and shift our expectations accordingly. Some have started disclosing when they have used AI in their writing, which I think is a good step towards better understanding of our use of LLMs. Knowing whether a text is written or "co-authored" by an LLM has an important effect on how a receiver views it; pretending otherwise is simply false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many see LLMs as a great boon for helping people express their opinions more clearly, particularly for people not using their native language or those who have learning disabilities. As long as the meaning originates from a person, LLMs can help express that meaning in correct and effective language. I have two main objections against this. The first one is about what happens to the text: In most cases it's impossible to separate the meaning from the expression of it. That is in essence what language is — the words are the meaning. Changing the phrasing changes the message. The second one is about what happens to us: We rob ourselves of the opportunity to grow and learn, without training wheels. LLMs can certainly help people improve the text, but the thinking process — developing the ideas — will be severely amputated when leaving the phrasing up to an AI model. They quickly become a replacement instead of help, depriving us the opportunity of discovering our own voice and who we can be and become when we stand on our own two feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With great care, one may be able to use a chatbot without being affected by these two drawbacks, but the problem is that with LLMs, there is an exceptionally thin line between getting help with spelling or grammar, and having the model essentially write for you, thereby glossing over your own voice. This is unavoidable with the current design of chatbots and LLM-powered tools; the step from old-school autocorrect to a generative language model is far too big. If we really envision LLMs as a tool for helping people become better at writing, we need to have a much more carefully considered interface than the chatbots we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I realize many are far more utilitarian. They just want to get the job done, finish their work, file that report, get that complaint through, answer that email, in the most efficient way possible, and then get on with their day. Getting help from an LLM to express oneself in a second language also seems useful, without considering how much or little one learns from it (I would be more positive to LLMs for translation if it wasn't for the fact that current state-of-the-art LLMs are simply very bad at producing Norwegian text. I can only hope the state is better for other non-English languages, or that it will improve over time). Additionally, LLMs seem to be efficient for people who are fighting with bureaucracy, such is filing complaints and dealing with insurance companies. In this case the advantage seems greater. We must, however, remember that the "weapon" exists on both sides of the table. What will happen to bureaucratic processes when all parties involved are armed with word generators?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not without reservation that I express these opinions, because it may come across as I want to deny people something that looks like a powerful tool. The point is that I think this tool will make you weaker, not stronger. LLMs don't really seem to empower people. Some of the effect I currently see is the number of applications to various calls (internships, research proposals, job openings) multiplying, but the quality dropping. Students are asking chatbots for help with solving collaborative tasks, not realizing that everyone is asking the same chatbot, robbing us of the diversity of ideas that could have formed if they took a minute to think for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chatbots may have lowered the threshold for participation, but the competition's ground rules hasn't changed. To get better at writing, you need to write. The same goes for thinking. Applying for a job means showing who you are, not who the LLM thinks you are, or should be. Participating in the public debate is having to work out how to express opinions in clear language. Am I really participating if I'm not finding my own words?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that not all text is affected in the same way. The category of writing that I like to call "functional text", which are things like computer code and pure conveyance of information (e.g., recipes, information signs, documentation), is not exposed to the same issues. But text that has a personal author addressing a human audience, has particular role expectations and rests on a particular trust. An erosion of that trust will be a loss for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pragmatic attitude would be to just let the inflation of text ensue, and take stock after the dust has settled. What will be left of language afterwards? My conservative viewpoint stems from believing that what we will lose is of greater worth than what we gain. While LLMs can prove useful in the short term, using them is treating a symptom instead of the problem. It is a crutch, although some may truly be in need of that crutch. My only advice would be to make sure you actually need it before you lean on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Valuable experiences&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using LLMs is not only about writing. Masley mentions that it's bad to outsource activities that are "a valuable experience on its own". I couldn't agree more, but I suspect that he will disagree when I say that I think this category encompasses a lot of what we already do in life. Major LLM providers love to show how their chatbots can be used to plan vacations, organize parties, and create personal messages to friends and family. I seldom feel more disconnected from the technological society than when I watch these advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, this highlights a problem that goes to the core of what it means to be human. Modern life brings with it a great deal of activities that can feel like chores, but at the same time it seems like we are hell-bent on treating everything as a chore as well. Humans are surprisingly good at finding discontentment in nearly anything, maybe because of an expectation in modern society that we should be able to do anything we want, anytime we want it — or perhaps more importantly, that we should be able to avoid doing things we don't feel like doing. Our inability to see opportunities and fulfillment in life as it is, leads to the inevitable conclusion that life is never enough, and we would always rather be doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, I agree that automating some things can free up time for other things that are potentially more meaningful and rewarding, but we have already reached a stage where even planning our vacation is a chore that apparently a lot of people would like to avoid doing. I hope that AI's alleged ability to automate "nearly anything" helps us realize what is worth spending time and effort on, and rediscover the value of intentional living.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Building knowledge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third point I would like to address is that we shouldn't use chatbots when it "builds complex tacit knowledge you'll need for navigating the world in the future", according to Masley. Again, I agree completely, and again, I think that this point encompasses a great deal of daily life. Building knowledge happens not only when you sit down to learn something new, but also when you do repetitive work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This misconception is not new for chatbots, but has been present since we started carrying smartphones in our pockets. With internet at hand at all times, there's apparently no need to remember information anymore. Instead of using our brains for storing knowledge, we can access information online when we need it, and spend more time learning how to actually use the information and think critically. The point we are missing here, is that acquiring and memorizing knowledge is a huge part of learning to use the knowledge. It is naive to think that we can simply separate the storage unit from the processing unit, like if we were a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson while being a piano student. I was trying to understand jazz, and figure out how good improvisers could learn to come up with new phrases so easily on the spot. How does one practice improvisation? Is it possible to exercise the ability to come up with something new that immediately sound good? I ended up playing similar riffs almost every time I tried. After a while I got convinced that good jazz players must be born with some inherent creativity, some inner musical inspiration that hummed melodies inside their heads for them to play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my tutors taught me the real trick: Good improvisation comes not from just practicing improvisation. You need to play existing songs and tunes, many of them, over and over, learn them by heart, get the chord progressions and motifs under your skin. This practice builds your intuition for what sounds good, and your improvisation can spring from that. Bits and pieces of old melodies are combined into new music. In that sense, we are more like a machine learning model than a computer, but do not make the mistake of thinking that is actually what we are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a need for clarification here: I'm not saying that nothing should be automated by LLMs. But I think many are severely underestimating the knowledge we are building from boring tasks, and we are in danger of losing that knowledge when the pressure for increased efficiency makes us turn to the chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The extended mind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a sidenote, I would like to contest the idea of the extended mind, as explained by Masley:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[M]uch of our cognition isn’t limited to our skull and brain, it also happens in our physical environment, so a lot of what we define as our minds could also be said to exist in the physical objects around us.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems kind of arbitrary whether it’s happening in the neurons in your brain or in the circuits in your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This statement is simply absurd, even when read in context. The fact that something happens in your brain rather than on a computer makes all the difference in the world. Humans are something more than information processors. Yes, we process information, but it is extremely reductionist to treat ourselves as objects where certain processes can be outsourced to external devices without consequences. Does it really matter if I remember my friend's birthday, when I can have a chatbot send them an automated congratulation? Yes, it matters because in the first case you are consciously remembering and thinking about your friend, consolidating your side of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quoted statement above is followed up with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s true that you could lose your phone and therefore lose the stored knowledge, but you could also have a part of your brain cut out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Losing your phone and losing a part of your brain are two tremendously different things, both in terms of likelihood and consequences. Not only does the statement above significantly underestimate the processes that happens in our brain, but to even liken having a part of your brain cut out to losing your phone reveals that the premiss of the argument is severely detached from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of our built environments is also brought up to show how it's beneficial to minimize the amount of thinking we do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[M]ost of our physical environments have been designed specifically to minimize the amount of thinking we have to do to achieve our daily goals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Try to imagine how much additional thinking you would need to do if things were designed differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Yes, if our environment suddenly changed, it would require extra mental effort of us to navigate. For a time. But, then we would have gotten familiar with that alternative design, and adapted ourselves. The only case where we would have had to do additional thinking is if the design of our physical environments changed all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What we think about does matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding the "lump of cognition fallacy", I fully agree that we need not worry about "draining a finite pool" of thinking, leaving "less thinking" — whatever that means — for humans. There is, however, another fallacy at play here, which is that "it does not matter what we think about, as long as we think about something". It is easy to be convinced that if a computer can do the simple, boring tasks for me, I can deal with more complex, exciting stuff myself. But we must be aware that certain mental tasks are important for us to do, even though a machine technically could do them for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate: If I outsource all my boring project administration tasks to a chatbot, it can leave more time for my main task: research. But it will also rob me of the opportunity to feel ownership to the project and build a basis for taking high-level decisions in the project. In a hypothetical situation where a chatbot performs all administrative tasks perfectly on my behalf, I will still have lost something, which may again have impact on the project. I'm not saying that no tasks should be automated at all, but we must be aware that we always lose something when automating a process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing with the "lump of labour" fallacy again: While it may be true that outsourcing physical work to machines will simply create new types of work to do, it doesn't mean that the new work is useful, fulfilling, or beneficial for individuals and society. The same goes for thinking. We must acknowledge that all kinds of thinking have an effect on us, even the boring and tedious kinds. Removing the need for some cognitive tasks can have just as much influence, positive or negative, as taking up new types of cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a major challenge ahead of us in figuring out what chatbots are suitable for in the long term. Personal communication may change forever (that is to say, maybe it won't stay personal anymore), education systems will require radical adaptations, and we need to reflect more carefully about which experiences in life actually matter. What is truly exciting about this new type of technology, is that it forces us to face questions about our humanity and values. Many formerly theoretical questions of philosophy are becoming relevant for our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fundamental point I'm trying to bring forth is that how we choose to use chatbots is not only about efficiency and cognitive consequences; it's about how we want our lives and society to be. I have tried to argue that there are good reasons for protecting certain human activities against the automation of machines. This is in part based on my values, and does not rely on research into whether or not our efficiency at work or cognitive abilities are affected by it. I cannot tell other people what they should do, but I challenge everyone to consider what values they want to build our communities on, and let that weigh in alongside what the research studies tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like many organizations, Wiki Education has grappled with generative AI, its impacts, opportunities, and threats, for several years. As an organization that runs large-scale programs to bring new editors to Wikipedia (we’re responsible for about 19% of all new active editors on English Wikipedia), we have deep understanding of what challenges face new content contributors to Wikipedia — and how to support them to successfully edit. As many people have begun using generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude in their daily lives, it’s unsurprising that people will also consider using them to help draft contributions to Wikipedia. Since Wiki Education’s programs provide a cohort of content contributors whose work we can evaluate, we’ve looked into how our participants are using GenAI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are choosing to share our perspective through this blog post because we hope it will help inform discussions of GenAI-created content on Wikipedia. In an open environment like the Wikimedia movement, it’s important to share what you’ve learned. In this case, we believe our learnings can help Wikipedia editors who are trying to protect the integrity of content on the encyclopedia, Wikipedians who may be interested in using generative AI tools themselves, other program leaders globally who are trying to onboard new contributors who may be interested in using these tools, and the Wikimedia Foundation, whose product and technology team builds software to help support the development of high-quality content on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our fundamental conclusion about generative AI is: Wikipedia editors should never copy and paste the output from generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT into Wikipedia articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AI detection and investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, we’ve been paying close attention to GenAI-created content, and how it relates to Wikipedia. We’ve spot-checked work of new editors from our programs, primarily focusing on citations to ensure they were real and not hallucinated. We experimented with tools ourselves, we led video sessions about GenAI for our program participants, and we closely tracked on-wiki policy discussions around GenAI. Currently, English Wikipedia prohibits the use of generative AI to create images or in talk page discussions, and recently adopted a guideline against using large language models to generate new articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As our Wiki Experts Brianda Felix and Ian Ramjohn worked with program participants throughout the first half of 2025, they found more and more text bearing the hallmarks of generative AI in article content, like bolded words or bulleted lists in odd places. But the use of generative AI wasn’t necessarily problematic, as long as the content was accurate. Wikipedia’s open editing process encourages stylistic revisions to factual text to better fit Wikipedia’s style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This finding led us to invest significant staff time into cleaning up these articles — far more than these editors had likely spent creating them. Wiki Education’s core mission is to improve Wikipedia, and when we discover our program has unknowingly contributed to misinformation on Wikipedia, we are committed to cleaning it up. In the clean-up process, Wiki Education staff moved more recent work back to sandboxes, we stub-ified articles that passed notability but mostly failed verification, and we PRODed some articles that from our judgment weren’t salvageable. All these are ways of addressing Wikipedia articles with flaws in their content. (While there are many grumblings about Wikipedia’s deletion processes, we found several of the articles we PRODed due to their fully hallucinated GenAI content were then de-PRODed by other editors, showing the diversity of opinion about generative AI among the Wikipedia community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Revising our guidance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given what we found through our investigation into the work from prior terms, and given the increasing usage of generative AI, we wanted to proactively address generative AI usage within our programs. Thanks to in-kind support from our friends at Pangram, we began running our participants’ Wikipedia edits, including in their sandboxes, through Pangram nearly in real time. This is possible because of the Dashboard course management platform Sage built, which tracks edits and generates tickets for our Wiki Experts based on on-wiki edits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We created a brand-new training module on Using generative AI tools with Wikipedia. This training emphasizes where participants could use generative AI tools in their work, and where they should not. The core message of these trainings is, do not copy and paste anything from a GenAI chatbot into Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We crafted a variety of automated emails to participants who Pangram detected were adding text created by generative AI chatbots. Sage also recorded some videos, since many young people are accustomed to learning via video rather than reading text. We also provided opportunities for engagement and conversation with program participants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Our findings from the second half of 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, we had 1,406 AI edit alerts in the second half of 2025, although only 314 of these (or 22%) were in the article namespace on Wikipedia (meaning edits to live articles). In most cases, Pangram detected participants using GenAI in their sandboxes during early exercises, when we ask them to do things like choose an article, evaluate an article, create a bibliography, and outline their contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pangram struggled with false positives in a few sandbox scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bibliographies, which are often a combination of human-written prose (describing a source and its relevance) and non-prose text (the citation for a source, in some standard format)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outlines with a high portion of non-prose content (such as bullet lists, section headers, text fragments, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also had a handful of cases where sandboxes were flagged for AI after a participant copied an AI-written section from an existing article to use as a starting point to edit or to expand. (This isn’t a flaw of Pangram, but a reminder of how much AI-generated content editors outside our programs are adding to Wikipedia!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In broad strokes, we found that Pangram is great at analyzing plain prose — the kind of sentences and paragraphs you’ll find in the body of a Wikipedia article — but sometimes it gets tripped up by formatting, markup, and non-prose text. Early on, we disabled alert emails for participants’ bibliography and outline exercises, and throughout the end of 2025, we refined the Dashboard’s preprocessing steps to extract the prose portions of revisions and convert them to plain text before sending them to Pangram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many participants also reported “just using Grammarly to copy edit.” In our experience, however, the smallest fixes done with Grammarly never trigger Pangram’s detection, but if you use its more advanced content creation features, the resulting text registers as being AI generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But overwhelmingly, we were pleased with Pangram’s results. Our early interventions with participants who were flagged as using generative AI for exercises that would not enter mainspace seemed to head off their future use of generative AI. We supported 6,357 new editors in fall 2025, and only 217 of them (or 3%) had multiple AI alerts. Only 5% of the participants we supported had mainspace AI alerts. That means thousands of participants successfully edited Wikipedia without using generative AI to draft their content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who did add GenAI-drafted text, we ensured that the content was reverted. In fact, participants sometimes self-reverted once they received our email letting them know Pangram had detected their contributions as being AI created. Instructors also jumped in to revert, as did some Wikipedians who found the content on their own. Our ticketing system also alerted our Wiki Expert staff, who reverted the text as soon as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some instructors in our Wikipedia Student Program had concerns about AI detection, we had a lot of success focusing the conversation on the concept of verifiability. If the instructor as subject matter expert could attest the information was accurate, and they could find the specific facts in the sources they were cited to, we permitted text to come back to Wikipedia. However, the process of attempting to verify student-created work (which in many cases the students swore they’d written themselves) led many instructors to realize what we had found in our own assessment: In their current states, GenAI-powered chatbots cannot write factually accurate text for Wikipedia that is verifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe our Pangram-based detection interventions led to fewer participants adding GenAI-created content to Wikipedia. Following the trend lines, we anticipated about 25% of participants to add GenAI content to Wikipedia articles; instead, it was only 5%, and our staff were able to revert all problematic content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m deeply appreciative of everyone who made this success possible this term: Participants who followed our recommendations, Pangram who gave us access to their detection service, Wiki Education staff who did the heavy lift of working with all of the positive detections, and the Wikipedia community, some of whom got to the problematic work from our program participants before we did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How can generative AI help?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve focused on the problems with generative AI-created content. But that’s not all these tools can do, and we did find some ways they were useful. Our training module encourages editors — if their institution’s policies permit it — to consider using generative AI tools for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying gaps in articles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding access to sources&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding relevant sources&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the success of these use scenarios, we worked directly with 7 of the classes we supported in fall 2025 in our Wikipedia Student Program. We asked students to anonymously fill out a survey every time they used generative AI tools in their Wikipedia work. We asked what tool they used, what prompt they used, how they used the output, and whether they found it helpful. While some students filled the survey out multiple times, others filled it out once. We had 102 responses reporting usage at various stages in the project. Overwhelmingly, 87% of the responses who reported using generative AI said it was helpful for them in the task. The most popular tool by far was ChatGPT, with Grammarly as a distant second, and the others in the single-digits of usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students reported AI tools very helpful in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying articles to work on that were relevant to the course they were taking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Highlighting gaps within existing articles, including missing sections or more recent information that was missing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finding reliable sources that they hadn’t already located&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pointing to which database a certain journal article could be found&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When prompted with the text they had drafted and the checklist of requirements, evaluating the draft against those requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying categories they could add to the article they’d edited&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Correcting grammar and spelling mistakes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critically, no participants reported using AI tools to draft text for their assignments. One student reported: “I pasted all of my writing from my sandbox and said ‘Put this in a casual, less academic tone’ … I figured I’d try this but it didn’t sound like what I normally write and I didn’t feel that it captured what I was trying to get across so I scrapped it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this was an informal research project, we received enough positive feedback from it to believe using ChatGPT and other tools can be helpful in the research stage if editors then critically evaluate the output they get, instead of blindly accepting it. Even participants who found AI helpful reported that they didn’t use everything it gave them, as some was irrelevant. Undoubtedly, it’s crucial to maintain the human thinking component throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What does this all mean for Wiki Education?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that, at least as of now, generative AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT should never be used to generate text for Wikipedia; too much of it will simply be unverifiable. Our staff would spend far more time attempting to verify facts in AI-generated articles than if we’d simply done the research and writing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, AI tools can be helpful in the research process, especially to help identify content gaps or sources, when used in conjunction with a human brain that carefully evaluates the information. Editors should never simply take a chatbot’s suggestion; instead, if they want to use a chatbot, they should use it as a brainstorm partner to help them think through their plans for an article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, Wiki Education’s interventions as our program participants edit Wikipedia show promise for keeping unverifiable, GenAI-drafted content off Wikipedia. Based on our experiences in the fall term, we have high confidence in Pangram as a detector of AI content, at least in Wikipedia articles. We will continue our current strategy in 2026 (with more small adjustments to make the system as reliable as we can).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, we found participants had less AI literacy than popular discourse might suggest. Because of this, we created a supplemental large language models training that we’ve offered as an optional module for all participants. Many participants indicated that they found our guidance regarding AI to be welcome and helpful as they attempt to navigate the new complexities created by AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also looking forward to more research on our work. A team of researchers — Francesco Salvi and Manoel Horta Ribeiro at Princeton University, Robert Cummings at the University of Mississippi, and Wiki Education’s Sage Ross — have been looking into Wiki Education’s Wikipedia Student Program editors’ use of generative AI over time. Preliminary results have backed up our anecdotal understanding, while also revealing nuances of how text produced by our students over time has changed with the introduction of GenAI chatbots. They also confirmed our belief in Pangram: After running student edits from 2015 up until the launch of ChatGPT through Pangram, without any date information involved, the team found Pangram correctly identified that it was all 100% human written. This research will continue into the spring, as the team explores ways of unpacking the effects of AI on different aspects of article quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, of course, generative AI is a rapidly changing field. Just because these were our findings in 2025 doesn’t mean they will hold true throughout 2026. Wiki Education remains committed to monitoring, evaluating, iterating, and adapting as needed. Fundamentally, we are committed to ensuring we add high quality content to Wikipedia through our programs. And when we miss the mark, we are committed to cleaning up any damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;What does this all mean for Wikipedia?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I’ve focused this post on what Wiki Education has learned from working with our program participants, the lessons are extendable to others who are editing Wikipedia. Already, 10% of adults worldwide are using ChatGPT, and drafting text is one of the top use cases. As generative AI usage proliferates, its usage by well-meaning people to draft content for Wikipedia will as well. It’s unlikely that longtime, daily Wikipedia editors would add content copied and pasted from a GenAI chatbot without verifying all the information is in the sources it cites. But many casual Wikipedia contributors or new editors may unknowingly add bad content to Wikipedia when using a chatbot. After all, it provides what looks like accurate facts, cited to what are often real, relevant, reliable sources. Most edits we ended up reverting seemed acceptable with a cursory review; it was only after we attempted to verify the information that we understood the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because this unverifiable content often seems okay at first pass, it’s critical for Wikipedia editors to be equipped with tools like Pangram to more accurately detect when they should take a closer look at edits. Automating review of text for generative AI usage — as Wikipedians have done for copyright violation text for years — would help protect the integrity of Wikipedia content. In Wiki Education’s experience, Pangram is a tool that could provide accurate assessments of text for editors, and we would love to see a larger scale version of the tool we built to evaluate edits from our programs to be deployed across all edits on Wikipedia. Currently, editors can add a warning banner that highlights that the text might be LLM generated, but this is based solely on the assessment of the person adding the banner. Our experience suggests that judging by tone alone isn’t enough; instead, tools like Pangram can flag highly problematic information that should be reverted immediately but that might sound okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve also found success in the training modules and support we’ve created for our program participants. Providing clear guidance — and the reason why that guidance exists — has been key in helping us head off poor usage of generative AI text. We encourage Wikipedians to consider revising guidance to new contributors in the welcome messages to emphasize the pitfalls of adding GenAI-drafted text. Software aimed at new contributors created by the Wikimedia Foundation should center starting with a list of sources and drawing information from them, using human intellect, instead of generative AI, to summarize information. Providing guidance upfront can help well-meaning contributors steer clear of bad GenAI-created text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia recently celebrated its 25th birthday. For it to survive into the future, it will need to adapt as technology around it changes. Wikipedia would be nothing without its corps of volunteer editors. The consensus-based decision-making model of Wikipedia means change doesn’t come quickly, but we hope this deep-dive will help spark a conversation about changes that are needed to protect Wikipedia into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(originally published on my old blog)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been learning Rust lately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is one of the most loved languages out there, is fast, and has an amazing community. Rust invented the concept of ownership as a solution memory management issues without resorting to something slower like Garbage Collection or Reference Counting. But, when you don’t need to be quite as low level, it gives you utilities such as &lt;code&gt;Rc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Cow&lt;/code&gt; to do reference counting and “clone-on-right” in your code. And, when you need to go lower-level still, you can use the &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; system and access raw C pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust also has a bunch of awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions, first class functions and a powerful type system with generics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also been doing a bit of Swift programming for a couple of years now. And the more I learn Rust, the more I see a reflection of Swift. (I know that Swift stole a lot of ideas from Rust, I’m talking about my own perspective here).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift, too, has awesome features from functional languages like tagged enums, match expressions and first-class functions. It too has a very powerful type system with generics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift too gives you complete type-safety without a garbage collector. By default, everything is a value type with “copy-on-write” semantics. But when you need extra speed you can opt into an ownership system and “move” values to avoid copying. And if you need to go even lower level, you can use the unsafe system and access raw C pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift has an LLVM-based compiler which lets it compile to native code and WASM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Deja Vu?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re probably feeling like you just read the same paragraphs twice. This is no accident. Swift is extremely similar to Rust and has most of the same feature-set. But there is a very big difference is perspective. If you consider the default memory model, this will start to make a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Rust is bottom-up, Swift is top-down.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is a low-level systems language at heart, but it gives you the tools to go higher level. Swift starts at a high level and gives you the ability to go low-level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most obvious example of this is the memory management model. Swift use value-types by default with &lt;code&gt;copy-on-write&lt;/code&gt; semantics. This is the equivalent of using &lt;code&gt;Cow&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for all your values in Rust. But defaults matter. Rust makes it easy to use “moved” and “borrowed” values but requires extra ceremony to use &lt;code&gt;Cow&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; values as you need to “unwrap” them &lt;code&gt;.as_mutable()&lt;/code&gt; to actually use the value within. Swift makes these Copy-on-Write values easy to use and instead requires extra ceremony to use borrowing and moving instead. Rust is faster by default, Swift is simpler and easier by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Swift takes Rust’s ideas and hides them in C-like syntax.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift’s syntax is a masterclass in taking awesome functional language concepts and hiding them in C-like syntax to trick the developers into accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; statements. This is what a match statement looks like in Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how that same code would be written in Swift:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; statement or expression. It has a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement that developers are already familiar with. Except this &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement is actually not a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement at all. It’s an expression. It doesn’t “fallthrough”. It does pattern matching. It’s just a &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; expression with a different name and syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, Swift treats &lt;code&gt;enums&lt;/code&gt; as more than just types and lets you put methods directly on it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;#Optional Types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust doesn’t have &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, but it does have &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. Swift has a &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, but it’s really just a &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; in hiding. Instead of an &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, Swift let’s you use &lt;code&gt;T?&lt;/code&gt;, but the compiler still forces you to check that the value is not &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; before you can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get the same safety with more convenience since you can do this in Swift with an optional type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, you’re not forced to wrap every value with a &lt;code&gt;Some(val)&lt;/code&gt; before returning it. The Swift compiler takes care of that for you. A &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; will transparently be converted into a &lt;code&gt;T?&lt;/code&gt; when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;#Error Handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust doesn’t have &lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt;. Instead it has a &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; type which contains the success and error types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift doesn’t have a &lt;code&gt;try-catch&lt;/code&gt; either, but it does have &lt;code&gt;do-catch&lt;/code&gt; and you have to use &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; before calling a function that could throw. Again, this is just deception for those developers coming from C-like languages. Swift’s error handling works exactly like Rust’s behind the scenes, but it is hidden in a clever, familiar syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very similar to how Rust let’s you use &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; at the end of statements to automatically forward errors, but you don’t have to wrap your success values in &lt;code&gt;Ok()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Rust’s compiler catches problems. Swift’s compiler solves some of them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many common problems that Rust’s compiler will catch at compile time and even suggest solutions for you. The example that portrays this well is self-referencing enums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider an enum that represents a tree. Since, it is a recursive type, Rust will force you to use something like &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for referencing a type within itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You could also us &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;Vec&amp;lt;TreeNode&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes the problem explicit and forces you to deal with it directly. Swift is a little more, automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: that you still have to annotate this &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;indirect&lt;/code&gt; keyword to indicate that it is recursive. But once you’ve done that, Swift’s compiler takes care of the rest. You don’t have to think about &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Rc&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The values just work normally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Swift is less “pure”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift was designed to replace Objective-C and needed to be able to interface with existing code. So, it has made a lot of pragmatic choices that makes it a much less “pure” and “minimalist” language. Swift is a pretty big language compared to Rust and has many more features built-in. However, Swift is designed with “progressive disclosure” in mind which means that just as soon as you think you’ve learned the language a little more of the iceberg pops out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are just some of the language features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Classes / Inhertence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;async-await&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;async-sequences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;actors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;getters and setters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lazy properties&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;property wrappers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Result Builders (for building tree-like structures. e.g. HTML / SwiftUI)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Convenience has its costs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift is a far easier language to get started and productive with. The syntax is more familiar and a lot more is done for you automatically. But this really just makes Swift a higher-level language and it comes with the same tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, a Rust program is much faster than a Swift program. This is because Rust is fast by default, and lets you be slow, while Swift is easy by default and lets you be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on this, I would say both languages have their uses. Rust is better for systems and embedded programming. It’s better for writing compilers and browser engines (Servo) and it’s better for writing entire operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift is better for writing UI and servers and some parts of compilers and operating systems. Over time I expect to see the overlap get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#The “cross-platform” problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a perception that Swift is only a good language for Apple platforms. While this was once true, this is no longer the case and Swift is becoming increasingly a good cross-platform language. Hell, Swift even compiles to wasm, and the forks made by the swift-wasm team were merged back into Swift core earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift on Windows is being used by The Browser Company to share code and bring the Arc browser to windows. Swift on Linux has long been supported by Apple themselves in order to push “Swift on Server”. Apple is directly sponsoring the Swift on Server conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year Embedded Swift was also announced which is already being used on small devices like the Panic Playdate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift website has been highlighting many of these projects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The browser company says that Interoperability is Swift’s super power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the Swift project has been trying make working with Swift a great experience outside of XCode with projects like an open source LSP and funding the the VSCode extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Swift is not a perfect language.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compile times are (like Rust) quite bad. There is some amount of feature creep and the language is larger than it should be. Not all syntax feels familiar. The package ecosystem isn’t nearly as rich as Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the “Swift is only for Apple platforms” is an old and tired cliche at this point. Swift is already a cross-platform, ABI-stable language with no GC, automatic Reference Counting and the option to opt into ownership for even more performance. Swift packages increasingly work on Linux. Foundation was ported to Swift, open sourced and made open source. It’s still early days for Swift as a good, more convenient, Rust alternative for cross-platform development, but it is here now. It’s no longer a future to wait for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;simplest-yocto-setup&lt;/code&gt; is an example of the simplest, but realistic and
working, Yocto/OpenEmbedded setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It aims at providing an example of how Yocto/OE can be used as the embedded Linux build system for end products without unnecessary complications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While working for several Bootlin customers on their Yocto/OpenEmbedded setups we have seen many problems caused by unnecessary complications in their layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have spent a lot of time in educating to writing clean layers, which often involved fixing problems by removing a lot of the code they had written or they had taken from existing third-party layers. In other words: making the code simple and "stupid", resulting in a more understandable, more efficient, easier to upgrade and less buggy build environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repository is implementing a similar setup, aiming at being a reference for product companies in need to set up a Yocto/OpenEmbedded build environment or to clean up what they already have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repository is composed of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;.config.yaml&lt;/code&gt;: a kas configuration file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;meta-kiss&lt;/code&gt;: the layer with the (fictitious) metadata for the products of a (fictitious) company&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; is the configuration file for the
kas utility, which allows to easily download
all the required third-party components in the correct place and enable
them in the configuration. In this example it downloads and enables:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the &lt;code&gt;bitbake&lt;/code&gt;build engine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the &lt;code&gt;openembedded-core&lt;/code&gt;repository which contains the&lt;code&gt;meta&lt;/code&gt;layer with all the "core" recipes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the &lt;code&gt;meta-arm&lt;/code&gt;repository which contains the&lt;code&gt;meta-arm&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;meta-arm-toolchain&lt;/code&gt;layers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the &lt;code&gt;meta-kiss&lt;/code&gt;layer, not downloaded as it is already part of this repository, but enabled in&lt;code&gt;build/conf/bblayers.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using kas is not mandatory to use Yocto/OpenEmbedded, but we found it simple and convenient. You can use another tool for your project if so you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;meta-kiss&lt;/code&gt; is a layer that demonstrates how a realistic layer for a
product company can (and, in our opinion, should) look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is named after the KISS principle which "states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated" (source: Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we used "kiss" as the hypothetical name of a fictitious company. The machine configurations in meta-kiss implement fictitious products, but except for their name they are actual development boards and the output images can be used on these boards. In real world use cases a layer implementing company products can reasonably be called &lt;code&gt;meta-&amp;lt;company-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the machine names should be named after the
product names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;meta-kiss&lt;/code&gt; layer provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;support for two machines&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a distro configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a few recipes, including kernel, U-Boot, a userspace application and an image recipe&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;meta-kiss&lt;/code&gt; is a single layer. The &lt;code&gt;bitbake&lt;/code&gt; Yocto/OE build
engine is powerful enough to handle lots of machines, recipes and even
multiple distros in a single layer. Thus using a simple layer in your
company is perfectly fine and encouraged, unless your need are so complex
that splitting it into multiple layers proves useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The meta-kiss layer contains two machine configurations, called dogbonedark, stompduck and freiheit93.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dogbonedark machine describes a fictitious product which in reality implements the BeagleBone® Black. In order to implement it we took the relevant content from the BeagleBone machine configuration found in the meta-ti-bsp layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could of course have used the meta-ti-bsp layer directly, however since the hardware is very well supported by the mainline kernel and U-Boot we only needed to write (or copy and paste!) only a small amount of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several BSP layers provided by hardware vendors bring in extra complexity, deviation from standard coding practices and even bugs and unnecessarily complex code. In the spirit of this project, we chose to provide an example of how you can do without them in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stompduck machine describes a fictitious product which in reality implements the STM32MP157A-DK1. For the same motivations, the minimum necessary code in this case was taken from the STM32MP1 machine configuration found in the meta-st-stm32mp layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the steps needed to implement the &lt;code&gt;dogbonedark&lt;/code&gt;, for the
&lt;code&gt;stompduck&lt;/code&gt; machine we additionally chose to boot it using
TrustedFirmware-A (TF-A).
In order to build TF-A, using the existing
recipe
from the meta-arm layer looked like a good choice given the balance between
the code quality of the meta-arm layer itself and the complexity required
for a recipe to build TF-A. So we added this layer to the kas configuration
file together with the meta-arm-toolchain layer it depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The freiheit93 machine describes a fictitious product which in reality implements the FRDM i.MX93. Here the minimal necessary code was take from meta-imx-frdm i.MX93 machine configuration and meta-freescale i.MX93 machine include. Additionally, firmware recipe was taken from meta-freescale boot firmwares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;code&gt;stompduck&lt;/code&gt; machine, we are relying on meta-arm to build the TF-A
firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we also showcase the handling of proprietary licenses that have to be accepted before building a component: the NXP firmwares require acceptance of the NXP EULA, by adding &lt;code&gt;NXP_EULA_v57&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NXP_EULA_v58&lt;/code&gt; to the
&lt;code&gt;LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the kas configuration file, after cloning this repository the &lt;code&gt;dogbonedark&lt;/code&gt; board is configured by default. Here's how you can have a
working image for that board in a few steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# If you don't have kas yet (needed once only):
pip install kas

# Use kas to download the third-party repositories needed
# (required the first time, or after changes to .config.yaml)
kas checkout

# Initialize the build environment
. openembedded-core/oe-init-build-env

# The default MACHINE is dogbonedark. To build for another board set the
# `MACHINE` variable in your shell, or in `site.conf` with one of these
# commands:
echo 'MACHINE ?= "stompduck"' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; conf/site.conf
echo 'MACHINE ?= "freiheit93"' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; conf/site.conf

# For the freiheit93 you additionally have to accept the NXP licenses,
# after reading their text in meta-kiss/recipes-bsp/firmware-imx/files:
echo 'LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED += "NXP_EULA_v57 NXP_EULA_v58"' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; conf/site.conf

# Run your first build
bitbake kiss-image

# Have dinner

# Find the output images here (replace dogbonedark if building for another
# machine):
ls -l tmp-glibc/deploy/images/dogbonedark/

# Flash the image (replace machine name, and use your uSD card device
# instead of XYZ!):
sudo bmaptool copy tmp-glibc/deploy/images/dogbonedark/kiss-image-dogbonedark.wic /dev/XYZ&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's all! Have a look around the code to know about the implementation details. We wrote some explanatory comments here and there which should help you understand the reason of several choices we made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also added some explanations in the git commit messages when the changes being committed were possibly not obvious. Look at the git history to discover the various steps we took, for example how we created the new meta-kiss layer skeleton initially and the process we took to add and modify a kernel defconfig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end we hope you like the advantages of this clean setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;uses Yocto scarthgap and builds on modern distros without the need of a container -- which you can of course use when it makes sense to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no manual cloning of layers: kas does it all for you&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no manual configuration, except of course for selecting a machine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a little amount of code: 333 lines in meta-kiss at the time of this writing, documentation included, not including the kernel defconfigs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and, most important, readable code -- at least we hope so!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
