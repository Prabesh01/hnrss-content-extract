  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Z80-μLM is a 'conversational AI' that generates short character-by-character sequences, with quantization-aware training (QAT) to run on a Z80 processor with 64kb of ram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root behind this project was the question: how small can we go while still having personality, and can it be trained or fine-tuned easily? With easy self-hosted distribution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is Yes! And a 40kb .com binary (including inference, weights &amp;amp; a chat-style UI) running on a 4MHz processor from 1976.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It won't pass the Turing test, but it might make you smile at the green screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For insight on how to best train your own model, see TRAINING.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two pre-built examples are included:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A conversational chatbot trained on casual Q&amp;amp;A pairs. Responds to greetings, questions about itself, and general banter with terse personality-driven answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; hello
HI
&amp;gt; are you a robot
YES
&amp;gt; do you dream
MAYBE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 20 Questions game where the model knows a secret topic and answers YES/NO/MAYBE to your questions. Guess correctly to WIN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; is it alive
YES
&amp;gt; is it big
YES
&amp;gt; does it have a trunk
YES
&amp;gt; is it grey
MAYBE
&amp;gt; elephant
WIN
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Includes tools for generating training data with LLMs (Ollama or Claude API) and balancing class distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigram hash encoding: Input text is hashed into 128 buckets - typo-tolerant, word-order invariant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2-bit weight quantization: Each weight is {-2, -1, 0, +1}, packed 4 per byte&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;16-bit integer inference: All math uses Z80-native 16-bit signed arithmetic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;~40KB .COM file: Fits in CP/M's Transient Program Area (TPA)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Autoregressive generation: Outputs text character-by-character&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No floating point: Everything is integer math with fixed-point scaling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interactive chat mode: Just run &lt;code&gt;CHAT&lt;/code&gt;with no arguments&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model doesn't understand you. But somehow, it gets you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your input is hashed into 128 buckets via trigram encoding - an abstract "tag cloud" representation. The model responds to the shape of your input, not the exact words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"hello there"  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]
"there hello"  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (same!)
"helo ther"    →  [bucket 23: 32, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (similar - typo tolerant)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is semantically powerful for short inputs, but there's a limit: longer or order-dependent sentences blur together as concepts compete for the same buckets. "Open the door and turn on the lights" will likely be too close to distringuish from "turn on the door and open the lights."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 1-2 word response can convey surprising nuance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt;- acknowledged, neutral&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;WHY?&lt;/code&gt;- questioning your premise&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;R U?&lt;/code&gt;- casting existential doubt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAYBE&lt;/code&gt;- genuine uncertainty&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;AM I?&lt;/code&gt;- reflecting the question back&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't necessarily a limitation - it's a different mode of interaction. The terse responses force you to infer meaning from context or ask probing direct yes/no questions to see if it understands or not (e.g. 'are you a bot', 'are you human', 'am i human' displays logically consistent memorized answers)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Short, varied inputs with consistent categorized outputs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fuzzy matching (typos, rephrasing, word order)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Personality through vocabulary choice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running on constrianed 8-bit hardware&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A chatbot that generates novel sentences&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Something that tracks multi-turn context deeply&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A parser that understands grammar&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anything approaching general intelligence&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's small, but functional. And sometimes that's exactly what you need&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input: 128 query trigram buckets + 128 context buckets&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hidden layers: Configurable depth/width, e.g., 256 → 192 → 128&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Output: One neuron per character in charset&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Activation: ReLU between hidden layers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Z80 is an 8-bit CPU, but we use its 16-bit register pairs (HL, DE, BC) for activations and accumulators. Weights are packed 4-per-byte (2-bit each) and unpacked into 8-bit signed values for the multiply-accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 16-bit accumulator gives us numerical stability (summing 256 inputs without overflow), but the model's expressiveness is still bottlenecked by the 2-bit weights, and naive training may overflow or act 'weirdly' without QAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of inference is a tight multiply-accumulate loop. Weights are packed 4-per-byte:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; Unpack 2-bit weight from packed byte
ld a, (PACKED)      ; Get packed weights
and 03h             ; Mask bottom 2 bits
sub 2               ; Map 0,1,2,3 → -2,-1,0,+1
ld (WEIGHT), a

; Rotate for next weight
ld a, (PACKED)
rrca
rrca
ld (PACKED), a
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The multiply-accumulate handles the 4 possible weight values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;MULADD:
    or a
    jr z, DONE       ; weight=0: skip entirely
    jp m, NEG        ; weight&amp;lt;0: subtract
    ; weight=+1: add activation
    ld hl, (ACC)
    add hl, de
    ld (ACC), hl
    ret
NEG:
    cp 0FFh
    jr z, NEG1       ; weight=-1
    ; weight=-2: subtract twice
    ld hl, (ACC)
    sbc hl, de
    sbc hl, de
    ld (ACC), hl
    ret
NEG1:
    ; weight=-1: subtract once
    ld hl, (ACC)
    sbc hl, de
    ld (ACC), hl
    ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After each layer, arithmetic right-shift by 2 to prevent overflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sra h        ; Shift right arithmetic (preserves sign)
rr l
sra h
rr l         ; ACC = ACC / 4
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's the entire neural network: unpack weight, multiply-accumulate, shift. Repeat ~100K times per character generated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You can't design software you don't work on&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only the engineers who work on a large software system can meaningfully participate in the design process. That’s because you cannot do good software design without an intimate understanding of the concrete details of the system. In other words, generic software design advice is typically useless for most practical software design problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Generic software design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is generic software design? It’s “designing to the problem”: the kind of advice you give when you have a reasonable understanding of the domain, but very little knowledge of the existing codebase. Unfortunately, this is the only kind of advice you’ll read in software books and blog posts1. Engineers love giving generic software design advice for the same reason that all technical professionals love “talking shop”. However, you should be very careful about applying generic advice to your concrete day-to-day work problems2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re doing real work, concrete factors dominate generic factors. Having a clear understanding of what the code looks like right now is far, far more important than having a good grasp on general design patterns or principles. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In large codebases, consistency is more important than “good design”. I won’t argue that point here, but I wrote about it at length in Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real codebases are typically full of complex, hard-to-predict consequences. If you want to make your change safely, that typically constrains your implementation choices down to a bare handful of possibilities.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large shared codebases never reflect a single design, but are always in some intermediate state between different software designs. How the codebase will hang together after an individual change is thus way more important than what ideal “north star” you’re driving towards.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world where you could rewrite the entire system at will, generic software design advice would be much more practical. Some projects are like this! But the majority of software engineering work is done on systems that cannot be safely rewritten. These systems cannot rely on “software design”, but must instead rely on internal consistency and the carefulness of their engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Concrete software design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does good software design look like, then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience, the most useful software design happens in conversations between a small group of engineers who all have deep understanding of the system, because they’re the ones working on it every day. These design discussions are often really boring to outsiders, because they revolve around arcane concrete details of the system, not around general principles that any technical person can understand and have an opinion on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kinds of topic being discussed are not “is DRY better than WET”, but instead “could we put this new behavior in subsystem A? No, because it needs information B, which isn’t available to that subsystem in context C, and we can’t expose that without rewriting subsystem D, but if we split up subsystem E here and here…“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep philosophical points about design are rarely important to the discussion. Instead, the most critical contributions point out small misunderstandings of concrete points, like: “oh, you thought B wasn’t available in context C, but we recently refactored C so now we could thread in B if we needed to”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When generic software design is useful&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generic software design advice is not useful for practical software design problems, but that doesn’t mean it’s totally useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generic software design advice is useful for building brand-new projects. As I argued above, when you’re designing a new feature in an existing system, concrete factors of the system dominate. But when you’re designing a new system, there are no concrete factors, so you can be entirely guided by generic advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generic software design advice is useful for tie-breaking concrete design decisions. I don’t think you should start with a generic design, but if you have a few candidate concrete pathways that all seem acceptable, generic principles can help you decide between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is particularly true at the level of the entire company. In other words, generic software design advice can help ensure consistency across different codebases. This is one of the most useful functions of an official “software architect” role: to provide a set of general principles so that individual engineers can all tie-break their concrete decisions in the same direction3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generic software design principles can also guide company-wide architectural decisions. Should we run our services in our own datacenter, or in the cloud? Should we use k8s? AWS or Azure? Once you get broad enough, the concrete details of individual services almost don’t matter, because it’s going to be a huge amount of work either way. Still, even for these decisions, concrete details matter a lot. There are certain things you just can’t do in the cloud (like rely on bespoke hardware setups), or that you can’t do in your own datacenter (like deploy your service to the edge in twelve different regions). If the concrete details of your codebase rely on one of those things, you’ll be in for a bad time if you ignore them when making company-wide architectural decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Architects and local minima&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those are all good reasons to do generic software design. One bad reason companies do generic software design is that it just sounds like a really good idea to people who aren’t working software engineers. Once you’re doing it, the incentives make it hard to stop. Many tech companies fall into this local minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not have your highest-paid software engineers spend their time exclusively making the most abstract, highest-impact decisions? You want your structural engineers to be drawing, not laying bricks, after all. I don’t know if structural engineering works like this, but I do know that software engineering doesn’t. In practice, software architecture advice often has to be ignored by the people on the ground. There’s simply no way to actually translate it into something they can implement, in the context of the current system as it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, for a practice that doesn’t work, “have your top engineers just do generic design” is surprisingly robust. Architects don’t have any skin in the game4, because their designs are handed off to actual engineering teams to implement. Because those designs can never be implemented perfectly, architects can both claim credit for successes (after all, it was their design) and disclaim failures (if only those fools had followed my design!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When working on large existing codebases, useful software design discussions are way, way more concrete than many people believe. They typically involve talking about individual files or even lines of code. You thus can’t do useful software design without being intimately familiar with the codebase (in practice, that almost always means being an active contributor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purely generic architecture is not useless, but its role should be restricted to (a) setting out paved paths for brand new systems, (b) tie-breaking decisions on existing systems, and (c) helping companies make broad technology choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, formal “big-picture software architect” roles that spend all their time laying out the initial designs for projects are doomed to failure. They sound like a good idea (and they’re a good deal for the architect, who can claim credit without risking blame), but they provide very little value to the engineering teams that are tasked with actually writing the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I believe that if you come up with the design for a software project, you ought to be responsible for the project’s success or failure. That would rapidly ensure that the people designing software systems are the people who know how to ship software systems. It would also ensure that the real software designers - the ones that have to take into account all the rough edges and warts of the codebase - get credit for the difficult design work they do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admit I’ve given my own generic software design advice here, here, here, and probably a dozen other places.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I say “real work problems”, I’m talking here about impure software engineering: codebases which are intended to solve actual business needs and are thus (a) full of compromises and (b) constantly in a state of change. If you’re working on an elegant single-purpose library or the software for space probes, I suspect much of this advice does not apply.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of truly awful decisions, it almost doesn’t matter if those general principles are good or not - as with individual codebases, the benefits of consistency outweigh the benefits of having the “best” possible design.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architects I’m talking about here, I mean. The job title “architect” covers a great many different kinds of job, including just “very senior engineer doing normal engineering work”. Many architects don’t have an “architect” title at all, and are just senior/staff/distinguished software engineers who have ascended above having to do any actual implementation.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pure and impure software engineering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do solo game developers tend to get into fights with big tech engineers? Why do high-profile external hires to large companies often fizzle out? Why is AI-assisted development amazing for some engineers and completely useless for others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because some engineers are doing very different kinds of work to other engineers. Those two types of engineers often assume their counterparts are simply incompetent, but they’re really just working in different fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These lectures notes run from the fall of 1966 to 1971. Feynman lectured prior to this period and continued on after 1971. With a few exceptions, the actual 2 hours lectures were not dated. However, the volumes in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to stress, again, that these are my personal notes and are only a representation of the lectures I attended. They are to the best of my ability my recreation from memory and my original real time notes. No AV recording system was used in the transcription of my raw notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volume 1&lt;lb/&gt; Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Cosmology&lt;lb/&gt; (224 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feynman solicited topic input from the scientists and engineers at the Labs for the coming year. New discoveries were being made in astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology at the time. This 1966-1967 lecture series focused on these subjects. This volume is unique since, as far as I can tell, Feynman did not lecture on this subject matter at CalTech. While much of the material is now dated, what remains is a look into the mind of Feynman as he worked to explain such topics as stellar evolution, nuclear synthesis, cosmology, “black stars” (aka black holes), and general relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I inserted more current content from the web which relates to the 1966-67 lectures with recent experimental observations and discoveries. While this lecture series has been “eclipsed” by the tremendous theoretical and experimental advancements over the past 45 years, I am sure the reader(s) will find in these lectures the power of Feynman’s insight and ability to have fun with a new subject not touched on by him at CalTech in his “normal” class and research work. I trust others, more specialized in the topics of volume 1, can and will contribute to the additional information to further enrich the notes in the future. This editing will best be done when the notes are moved and dropped in a dynamic and editable platform, yet to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Volume I subject matter was not part of his prior lecture activity, Feynman would talk with some of his CalTech colleagues who worked in the field of astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology about their work and theories. He would then come to the lecture literally with a (maybe 2 or 3) 3×5 cards and proceed to pour out 2 hours of theory and complex mathematical representations of the topic of the day. This was his genius and almost mystical in his ability to focus his thinking and presentation ability on the most important aspects of a given topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volumes 2&lt;lb/&gt; Relativity, Electrostatics, Electrodynamics, Matter-Wave Interaction&lt;lb/&gt; (209 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feynman reflected on how he could teach his original FLP’s volume 2 &amp;amp; 3 differently and better than in his first pass through the subjects five years earlier. The attendees wanted him to lecture a couple years on the subject matter in the original FLP and essentially let him give his revised, enhanced, and expanded lectures. This then led more naturally into QED with a good foundation layer established. Feynman also tailored his lectures more to the level of his audience understanding they were not freshman and sophomore undergraduates but post graduate, doctorate level scientists, employed doing advanced research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volume 3&lt;lb/&gt; More on Matter-Wave Interaction, Intro to Quantum Mechanics, Scattering Theory, Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum, Intro to Lie Group, SU 2 &amp;amp; 3 “stuff”, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Pair Production&lt;lb/&gt; (314 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feynman went on in greater detail to complete his lectures on wave-matter interaction. From there he started into quantum mechanics and his path history formulation. He extended his lectures to include Lie Group theory and the SU 2&amp;amp;3 “Stuff”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feynman diagrams are discussed in Volume 3 at some length as he went deep into QED theory including such topics as quantum scattering. As better understood today, his diagrams represent a visual language of the complex physical processes at the particle interaction level. I have noted recently that with the power of new computers and new concepts the Feynman diagrams have, arguably, run their course. While this is possibly the case, I would assert that bypassing a fundamental understanding of the Feynman diagram concept makes it hard to understand what replaces them. This is like hand held calculators replacing the need to know the fundamental multiplication tables and being able to check what the calculator is telling you. I personally observed in a number of lectures where Feynman would self-check himself as he was working out the math because he could sense that if he kept going he would not get the right physics. This was his true genius at work. That was truly amazing to both watch and try to absorb in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volume 4&lt;lb/&gt; Molecular Biology&lt;lb/&gt; (65 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Molecular Biology lectures started out and then eventually died out as the year progressed. Feynman found the material challenging to get his head around before the lecture and, therefore, very time consuming. He apparently found a CalTech colleague, Seymour Benzer, who changed from physics to biophysics as a person who stimulated Feynman’s interest in this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By consensus the lecture series ended early. Feynman was deep into his own parton theory which was his version of quark theory. He and Gell-Mann were collegial competitors in those days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In preparing these notes for release I decided to include what notes I had of those lectures only to give evidence of Feynman’s interest to explore all the dimensions of science and nature. For those involved in the field these notes will not provide much informational value particularly with all the advancements on research and understanding of molecular biology. The value, I believe, for the reader is how Feynman thought through the subject matter and mentally organized it so he could lecture on it. That might aid teachers in this field to sharpen up their own presentation material. At the end of the volume are my un-transcribed real-time notes that I never got to but I decided to include for those who are into this field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volume 5&lt;lb/&gt; Mathematical Methods/Techniques in Physics and Engineering&lt;lb/&gt; (163 pages)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By some who have seen samples of my notes Volume 5 has been referred to as the “missing lectures” to the FLP “Red Books”. Feynman himself felt that he should have taught the mathematical methods first and then the physics since math is the “language” of physics. Feynman was apparently talked out of starting with a course in math-physics. The attendees at the lab talked him into a year-long lecture on his approach to mathematics as the language of physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I note here also that the math lectures have been referred on the Reddit by someone as “sophomoric” since all physic students must take similar course work and presumably “master” math while learning the physics. In my own case I wanted to learn the physics and minimize the math, or better said, not confused by the physics because the math was too difficult to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how Feynman approached physics and how he taught himself, at an early age, by developing many shortcuts through the math; “Feynman diagrams” were one clear by product of his self learning process. He did not want to get bogged down and distracted from understanding the physics. This is why and how he got involved in the Manhattan Project; he was their math wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One story he told of those days: Someone came running into him needing a quick answer to a nuclear decay process that was described by some expansion series like the Sum from 1 to infinity of 1/(1+n^2)[probably not the real one]. Feynman asked how accurately he wanted the answer and the person said 10% would do for now. Feynman said he took a few seconds and said the answer was 1.3 (or something like that); the person was amazed how fast he could give him that and asked how he did it. He said since you told me you only wanted the answer to 10%, it was only necessary to go to the second term in the series expansion and that was good enough for better than 10% accuracy. This story is emblematic of Feynman’s mathematical thinking which is not sophomoric. This is why he made such a contribution to the Manhattan project and ultimately QED. He did indeed “think different”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my own experience I found in my graduate studies that the some of the professors tended to focus more on the math rigor than in teaching the real physics. In Feynman’s world he “felt” the physics and used the math to express that “feeling” and understanding. Language does not necessarily express the essence of the content contained in the idea being described. One must understand both the power and limitations of the language used when discussing a subject. Words don’t always express what one wants to say; so it is for math and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lecture Sidebars: Another “feature”, or aspect, of the notes is my attempt to capture “side bar” topics. These special topics or thoughts (including some philosophical ones) added color and currency to the lectures as only Feynman could deliver. He was unconstrained in the lecture environment to take off on a sidebar and the attendees both enjoyed and encouraged him to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Was Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn and All I Got Was 1.50 EUR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you live in Germany, you have been treated like livestock by Deutsche Bahn (DB). Almost all of my friends have a story: they traveled with DB, got thrown out in the middle of the night in some cow village, and had to wait hours for the next train.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have something better. I was kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 24th, 2025. 15:30. Cologne Main Station, Platform 9 D-G.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am taking the RE5 (ID 28521) to my grandmother’s house in Meckenheim. Scheduled departure: 15:32. Scheduled arrival in Bonn: 15:54. From there, the S23 to Meckenheim. A journey of 35 kilometers, or, in DB units, somewhere between forty-five minutes and the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to arrive early to spend more time with her. My father, who lives near Troisdorf, was supposed to join us later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I board the train. It is twenty minutes late. I consider this early. At least the train showed up. In DB’s official statistics, a train counts as “on time” if it’s less than six minutes late.1 Cancelled trains are not counted at all.2 If a train doesn’t exist, it cannot be late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The train starts moving. The driver announces there are “issues around Bonn.” He does not specify what kind. No one asks. We have learned not to ask. He suggests we exit at Cologne South and take the subway, or continue to Troisdorf and catch a bus from there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decide to continue to Troisdorf. My father can just pick me up there and we drive together. The plan adapts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver announces the full detour: from Cologne South to Troisdorf to Neuwied to Koblenz. The entire left bank of the Rhine is unavailable. Only then I notice: the driver has been speaking German only. If you were a tourist who got on in Cologne to visit Brühl, thirteen minutes away, you were about to have a very confusing Christmas in Troisdorf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A woman near me is holding chocolates and flowers. She is on the phone with her mother. “Sorry Mama, I’ll be late.” Pause. “Deutsche Bahn.” Pause. Her mother understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes later. We are approaching Troisdorf. I stand up. I gather my things. My father texts me: he is at the station, waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver comes back on: “Hello everyone. Apparently we were not registered at Troisdorf station, so we are on the wrong tracks. We cannot stop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He says this the way someone might say “the coffee machine is broken.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silence. Laughter. Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I watch Troisdorf slide past the window. Somewhere in the parking lot outside the station, my father is sitting in his car, watching his son pass by as livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My father calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The train couldn’t stop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Next stop is Neuwied.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Neuwied?” Pause. “That’s in Rheinland-Pfalz.” Pause. “That’s a different federal state.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yup.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was trying to travel 35 kilometers. I was now 63 kilometers from my grandmother’s house. Further away than when I started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are fifteen stations between Troisdorf and Neuwied. We pass all of them [^6].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point you stop being a passenger and start being cargo. A cow transporter. Mooohhhhh. A cow transporter going to a cow village. (Germany has a word for this: Kuhdorf. The cows are metaphorical. Usually.) I reached this point around Oberkassel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DB once operated a bus to Llucalcari, a Mallorcan village of seventeen people.3 I wanted to take it home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An English speaker near the doors is getting agitated. “What is happening? Why didn’t we stop?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are not registered for this track.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But where will we stop?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Neuwied. Fifty-five minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fifty-five minutes.” He said it again, quieter. “I am being kidnapped.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My seatmate, who had not looked up from his book in forty minutes, turned a page. “Deutsche Bahn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked up my compensation.4 1.50 EUR. Minimum payout threshold: 4.00 EUR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had been kidnapped at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world’s largest accounting body is to stop students being allowed to take exams remotely to crack down on a rise in cheating on tests that underpin professional qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), which has almost 260,000 members, has said that from March it will stop allowing students to take online exams in all but exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing the sophistication of [cheating] systems outpacing what can be put in, [in] terms of safeguards,” Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said in an interview with the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote testing was introduced during the Covid pandemic to allow students to continue to be able to qualify at a time when lockdowns prevented in-person exam assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK’s accounting and auditing industry regulator, said that cheating in professional exams was a “live” issue at Britain’s biggest companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A number of multimillion-dollar fines have been issued to large auditing and accounting companies around the world over cheating scandals in tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FRC’s investigation found that instances of cheating also included some tier-one auditors, a category comprising the “big four” accountants – KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY – along with Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, EY agreed to pay a record $100m (£74m) to US regulators over claims that dozens of its employees cheated on an ethics exam and that the company then misled investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACCA said it had concluded that online tests have become too difficult to police, given the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) tools available to students.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brand said the ACCA, which has more than half a million students, had worked “intensively” to combat cheating but “people who want to do bad things are probably working at a quicker pace”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She added that the rapid rise of technology, led by AI tools, had pushed the issue of cheating to a “tipping point”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), which also trains accountants around the world, said reports of cheating were still increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the ICAEW still permits some exams to be sat online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are very few high-stakes examinations now that are allowing [remote invigilation],” Brand said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I own more books than I can read. Not in a charming, aspirational way, but in the practical sense that at some point I stopped knowing what I owned. Somewhere around 500 books, memory stopped being a reliable catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, I told myself I would fix this. Nothing elaborate, nothing worthy of a startup idea. A spreadsheet would have been enough. I never did it, not because it was hard, but because it was tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gap between intention and execution was small, but it was enough to keep the project permanently parked in the someday pile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2025, I had been working with AI agents long enough that this kind of project finally felt possible. Not because they made things more impressive, but because they removed the part I always stalled on. Execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bookshelf project is where I clearly understood what my role becomes once execution stops being the bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried the obvious tools first. ISBN scanner apps failed on Romanian editions, and Goodreads could not identify obscure publishers or antiquarian finds. Anything even slightly nonstandard came back incomplete or wrong. Partial data felt worse than no data at all, so every attempt ended the same way: a few entries filled in, followed by abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I needed was not a better app, but a way to tolerate imperfection without the whole system falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every project starts with bad data, and this one started with worse data. One afternoon, I photographed every book I own: spines, covers, duplicates, and the occasional blurry thumb. Four hundred and seventy photos in total. Once the images were on my laptop, I opened Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first steps were mechanical. Renaming files. Converting &lt;code&gt;HEIC&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;JPG&lt;/code&gt;. Then
I asked for something real: a script that sends each image to OpenAI's vision
API, extracts author, title, and publisher, normalizes names, resizes images
to avoid wasting tokens, and writes everything to a &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude wrote the script and ran it. It worked. Not perfectly, but well enough to matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": "ZfEPBCMZDaCKm6k0NVJ8F",
  "title": "Simulacre și simulare",
  "author": "Jean Baudrillard",
  "publisher": "Colectia Panopticon",
  "source": "dataset/83.jpg",
},
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roughly 90 percent of the books came back correct. The failures were predictable: poor lighting, damaged covers, unreadable spines. One novel was confidently identified as a 1987 Soviet agricultural manual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fixed the rest by hand. That decision was not technical, it was judgment. Ninety percent accuracy was enough. Chasing the remaining ten percent would have meant days of edge cases for very little additional value. That was the first moment where my role became clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, when I received a few books for Christmas, we added a second script that runs the same pipeline for new additions. Photo in, metadata and images out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The covers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With metadata sorted, covers were still missing. My photos showed spines, not artwork, and I wanted a clean visual representation. Claude suggested using Open Library's API to fetch covers, which mostly worked. Half the covers were low quality or incorrect, and Romanian editions barely existed in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We iterated. Claude wrote a second pass, another model call that scored cover quality and flagged bad matches. For flagged books, it fell back to Google Images via SerpAPI. That handled most cases. A few remained: antiquarian finds and obscure Soviet boxing manuals that no database was ever going to have clean assets for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened Photoshop and fixed ten covers by hand. For a collection of 460 books, ten manual edits felt like a win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The shelf&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the data and covers were in place, the UI came next. The obvious solution was a grid of covers. It was correct, and it was lifeless. I kept looking at my physical bookshelf instead. What makes it interesting is not the covers, but the spines. Different widths, uneven pressure, colors blending into a single texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was the thing I wanted to recreate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude did not invent that idea. It executed it. It wrote a script to extract dominant colors from each cover using color quantization, then computed contrasting text colors for readability. The result was better, but still wrong. Every book had the same width, and real books are not like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Library had page counts. We mapped page count to spine width and added slight variation to break the uniformity. At that point, it finally looked like a bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": "ZfEPBCMZDaCKm6k0NVJ8F",
  "title": "Simulacre si simulare",
  "author": "Jean Baudrillard",
  "backgroundColor": "#f0f0ff",
  "color": "#1f1f2e",
  "paddingLeft": 13,
  "paddingRight": 13,
  "height": 384,
  "cover": "/images/bookshelf/simulacre-si-simulare@2x.webp",
  "source": "dataset/83.jpg"
},
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The animation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visually, the shelf worked, but it felt static. A real shelf responds to touch. When you run your finger along the spines, they tilt slightly. I asked Claude for an animation, and it came back with a scroll based tilt using Framer Motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was close, but wrong. The movement snapped instead of flowing. I did not know why, I just knew it felt off. That was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude explained the issue immediately. We were updating React state on every scroll event, causing unnecessary re renders. The fix was to use motion values and springs that animate outside React's render cycle. Two minutes later, it was fixed. I spent the next few minutes scrolling back and forth, just watching it move. This was the moment my caution dropped, not because the tool was always right, but because the cost of trying ideas had collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Killing good code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That confidence had a downside. I started asking for things I did not need. Infinite scroll seemed sensible. Why render 460 books at once? Claude implemented it, and technically it worked. Memory stayed flat, and the DOM updated correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But scrolling broke. The container height desynced, the last books were unreachable, and every attempted fix introduced new jank. The feature worked, but the experience did not. So we removed it. Not because it was broken, but because it was unnecessary. Four hundred and sixty books is not a scale problem. Knowing when to delete working code is not something an AI can decide for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The stack view&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shelf looked great on desktop, but on mobile, horizontal scrolling felt cramped. I wanted an alternative layout: books lying flat, stacked vertically, readable without tilting your head. I pointed Claude at the shelf implementation and asked for a stack view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It read the code, inferred the patterns, and reused them: animation timing, color extraction, scroll based opacity, the same data shape. It built the new component and wired up a toggle between layouts. It worked without explanation. That surprised me more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I actually did&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude wrote all the code. So what did I do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I decided that 90 percent accuracy was enough.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I fixed the ten covers no API could find.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I rejected a grid because I wanted spines.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I deleted infinite scroll because I did not need it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I kept scrolling the animation until it felt right.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude handled implementation. I handled taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of false starts, my bookshelf finally exists. Four hundred and sixty books, cataloged and displayed at bookshelf. I almost dismissed Claude Code as hype. Now, the times when I wrote everything by hand feel distant, almost strange.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Execution keeps getting cheaper. Taste still does not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;OP here.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most Deep Learning approaches for TSP rely on pre-training with large-scale datasets. I wanted to see if a solver could learn "on the fly" for a specific instance without any priors from other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I built a solver using PPO that learns from scratch per instance. It achieved a 1.66% gap on TSPLIB d1291 in about 5.6 hours on a single A100.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Core Idea: My hypothesis was that while optimal solutions are mostly composed of 'minimum edges' (nearest neighbors), the actual difficulty comes from a small number of 'exception edges' outside of that local scope.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Instead of pre-training, I designed an inductive bias based on the topological/geometric structure of these exception edges. The agent receives guides on which edges are likely promising based on micro/macro structures, and PPO fills in the gaps through trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see RL reach this level without a dataset. I have open-sourced the code and a Colab notebook for anyone who wants to verify the results or tinker with the 'exception edge' hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Code &amp;amp; Colab: https://github.com/jivaprime/TSP_exception-edge&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Happy to answer any questions about the geometric priors or the PPO implementation!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;SIM cards, the small slips of plastic that have held your mobile subscriber information since time immemorial, are on the verge of extinction. In an effort to save space for other components, device makers are finally dropping the SIM slot, and Google is the latest to move to embedded SIMs with the Pixel 10 series. After long avoiding eSIM, I had no choice but to take the plunge when the time came to review Google’s new phones. And boy, do I regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The journey to eSIM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SIM cards have existed in some form since the ’90s. Back then, they were credit card-sized chunks of plastic that occupied a lot of space inside the clunky phones of the era. They slimmed down over time, going through the miniSIM, microSIM, and finally nanoSIM eras. A modern nanoSIM is about the size of your pinky nail, but space is at a premium inside smartphones. Enter, eSIM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The eSIM standard was introduced in 2016, slowly gaining support as a secondary option in smartphones. Rather than holding your phone number on a removable card, an eSIM is a programmable, non-removable component soldered to the circuit board. This allows you to store multiple SIMs and swap between them in software, and no one can swipe your SIM card from the phone. They also take up half as much space compared to a removable card, which is why OEMs have begun dropping the physical slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple was the first major smartphone maker to force the use of eSIM with the release of the iPhone 14, and it makes use of that space. The international iPhone 17 with a SIM card slot has a smaller battery than the eSIM-only version, but the difference is only about 8 percent. Google didn’t make the jump until this year with the Pixel 10 series—the US models are eSIM-only, but they unfortunately don’t have more of anything compared to the international versions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I've been chipping away at a small Redis-compatible key/value server called &lt;code&gt;kv&lt;/code&gt;. The goal is to have something (mostly) production-ready, while implementing
only a small subset of commands. The world doesn't necessarily need another key/value store, I'm just interested in
implementing it in Zig and learning about some new (to me) techniques for systems programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of those techniques is static memory allocation during initialization. The idea here is that all memory is requested and allocated from the OS at startup, and held until termination. I first heard about this while learning about TigerBeetle, and they reference it explicitly in their development style guide dubbed "TigerStyle".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All memory must be statically allocated at startup. No memory may be dynamically allocated (or freed and reallocated) after initialization. This avoids unpredictable behavior that can significantly affect performance, and avoids use-after-free. As a second-order effect, it is our experience that this also makes for more efficient, simpler designs that are more performant and easier to maintain and reason about, compared to designs that do not consider all possible memory usage patterns upfront as part of the design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although, this isn't as straightforward as it might sound at first. The first question that comes to mind might be: "How much memory do I allocate?" Of course, the answer depends on the system. If we're writing a server, how many concurrent connections do we allow? How much space is each connection allowed to work with? How much data do we expect to process at any given time? Are there limits in response size? Do we need all the data at once, or can it streamed in some fashion?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all questions that depend on the nature of the system and the context in which it will operate. I believe that going through the exercise of answering these questions is ultimately a good thing, as it seems to have a strong possibility of resulting in more stable systems, and forces us to understand the nature of our program at a deeper level.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the language front, I feel like Zig is currently the best option out there for doing this with relative ease, considering its design choices around explicit memory allocation and the &lt;code&gt;std.mem.Allocator&lt;/code&gt; interface, which allows
the standard library to ship with a variety of different allocators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at how we can manage static allocation in &lt;code&gt;kv&lt;/code&gt;, considering three areas of request handling in
sequence: connection handling, command parsing, and key/value storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A lot of this is pretty new to me, and I'm still wrestling with all these concepts. (And learning Zig!) I'm sure there are better ways of handling this stuff. I'm presenting this as one possible implementation completed as a learning exercise. I'll speak more about the trade-offs and where I think it can go further at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Connection Handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing we have to consider is how data comes into the system, which we'll maintain through the concept of a &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A connection represents the communication to a particular client that wants to access the key/value store. Since we're using &lt;code&gt;io_uring&lt;/code&gt; for asynchronous I/O, we have to keep some information around through the life-cycle of
a request, so the kernel can use it. The space for that information is what we'll statically allocate and re-use across
different connections as they come and go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const Connection = struct {
	completion: Completion = undefined,
	client: posix.socket_t = undefined,
	
	recv_buffer: *ByteArray,
	send_buffer: *ByteArray,
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connections also must maintain something called a "completion". This detail is related to integration with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;io_uring&lt;/code&gt;, the full details of which are outside the scope of this post. There are some good resources here and here. I also took some inspiration from TigerBeetle's IO module.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During initialization, we create three pools: one for the Connection structs themselves, one for receive buffers (requests), and one for send buffers (responses). When a request comes in to the server, a Connection is pulled from a &lt;code&gt;std.heap.MemoryPool&lt;/code&gt;, and then two buffers are associated with that &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt;. The buffers are
implemented as &lt;code&gt;ByteArray&lt;/code&gt; structs, which are in turn allocated as part of a &lt;code&gt;ByteArrayPool&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;ByteArrayPool&lt;/code&gt;
is custom and uses a free list to keep track of which buffers are available
to reserve for a new connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const ConnectionPool = struct {
    const Pool = std.heap.MemoryPoolExtra(Connection, .{ .growable = false });

    recv_buffers: ByteArrayPool,
    send_buffers: ByteArrayPool,

    connections: Pool,

    fn init(
        config: Config,
        gpa: std.mem.Allocator,
    ) !ConnectionPool {
        const allocation = config.allocation();
        const recv_size = allocation.connection_recv_size;
        const send_size = allocation.connection_send_size;

        const pool = try Pool.initPreheated(gpa, config.connections_max);
        const recv_buffers = try ByteArrayPool.init(gpa, config.connections_max, recv_size);
        const send_buffers = try ByteArrayPool.init(gpa, config.connections_max, send_size);

        return .{
            .recv_buffers = recv_buffers,
            .send_buffers = send_buffers,
            .connections = pool,
        };
    }
	
...
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At runtime, connections are created and destroyed (marked as available) using these pools and no actual allocation needs to happen. If no &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt; is available in the pool, the request is rejected and the client will have to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does mean that the server must be configured with an upper limit on the number of connections. Each connection must also have a limit on how much data it can receive and send.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first this might seem limiting, but in practice, it creates a more robust system. Databases in particular will enforce a limit on the number of active connections for that exact reason! For a backend, networked system like &lt;code&gt;kv&lt;/code&gt;,
I would say something like 1000 active connections is a pretty reasonable limit. For a public facing system you'd
likely want more. Of course, this should all be configurable by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Config&lt;/code&gt; struct given to the &lt;code&gt;ConnectionPool&lt;/code&gt; represents these user-configured options. Note that the &lt;code&gt;Config&lt;/code&gt;
struct has a method &lt;code&gt;.allocation()&lt;/code&gt; which is computed after the options have been set. In this case,
the &lt;code&gt;connection_recv_size&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;connection_send_size&lt;/code&gt; depend on other options, such as &lt;code&gt;config.key_count&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;config.key_size_max&lt;/code&gt;. We'll revisit those later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that data can get into the system, the next step is to parse out Redis commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Command Parsing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to be compatible with Redis (at least a very small subset of it), &lt;code&gt;kv&lt;/code&gt; has to parse incoming commands
following the Redis serialization protocol ("RESP") format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's an example of an incoming &lt;code&gt;GET key&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;*2\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$3\r\nkey\r\n
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won't go into detail on how these commands are structured, the RESP document will do a much better job there. Basically, what we're looking at is "Here's an array with 2 elements. The first element has 3 characters, with the content &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; and the second element has 3 characters, with the contenhttps://github.com/nickmonad/kvt &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to parse this command, we need to look at the buffer that contains the request data, create some kind of iterator over that buffer, and split each entry on the CRLF &lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt; byte sequence. Here's the signature for &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt;,
the function that does just that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub fn parse(config: Config, alloc: std.mem.Allocator, buf: []const u8) !Command
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allocator is used to create some book-keeping structure as we parse through the command. We need to create a list of &lt;code&gt;[]const u8&lt;/code&gt; slices that points into the whole buffer and then is given to a command's &lt;code&gt;parse()&lt;/code&gt; function, once
we know the command. This has the benefit of being a "zero copy" approach to parsing. No request data needs to be copied,
only pointed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig's &lt;code&gt;std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator&lt;/code&gt; is perfect for this kind of operation. During initialization, we ask for buffer
space from a general purpose allocator, and pass it to the &lt;code&gt;FixedBufferAllocator&lt;/code&gt;. This allocator works as "bump" allocator,
where each internal allocation happens in a linear fashion, up to the amount of available space. The trade-off here is
that memory allocated within the fixed buffer can't be free'd directly. Instead, the entire buffer is reset after use,
which simply resets an index back to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. (Just about as cheap as an operation can get!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since our server is single-threaded2 and processes one request at a time, we can re-use this &lt;code&gt;FixedBufferAllocator&lt;/code&gt;
across every request. After the request is processed, the response is copied to a &lt;code&gt;Writer&lt;/code&gt; object backed by the
connection's &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt; buffer and the &lt;code&gt;FixedBufferAllocator&lt;/code&gt; is reset for the next request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing how much space to give the &lt;code&gt;FixedBufferAllocator&lt;/code&gt; depends again on our system configuration. We need space for
the &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; of parsed command items, and space for any copied list items that are written back as a response during
command execution. Parsing must be able to support the largest possible command (a list &lt;code&gt;PUSH&lt;/code&gt; of maximum size/length) and
copying has to support the largest possible response (again, a maximally sized list).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copying has the extra consideration that we have to actually store the copied list items, which are duplicated when read from the key/value store. During parsing, we just need to keep slices into the request buffer. For the copied items, we need to keep a list of slices that point to the items, and the items themselves. As long as we give the &lt;code&gt;FixedBufferAllocator&lt;/code&gt; space, we can use it for all these (sub-)allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub const Runner = struct {
    config: Config,
    fba: std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator,
    kv: *Store,

    pub fn init(config: Config, gpa: std.mem.Allocator, kv: *Store) !Runner {
        const L = config.list_length_max;
        const V = config.val_size_max;

        // ArrayList([]const u8) of largest possible command.
        // "[L/R]PUSH list item1 item2 ... itemL"
        const parse_cap = (1 + 1 + L);
        const parse_size: u64 = (parse_cap * @sizeOf([]const u8));

        // ArrayList([]const u8) pointing to duplicated values.
        const copy_size = (L * @sizeOf([]const u8));
        const copy_data = (L * V);

        const fba_size: u64 = parse_size + copy_size + copy_data;
        const buffer = try gpa.alloc(u8, fba_size);
        const fba = std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator.init(buffer);

        return .{
            .config = config,
            .fba = fba,
            .kv = kv,
        };
    }
...
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The underlying &lt;code&gt;Store&lt;/code&gt; will use the &lt;code&gt;FixedBufferAllocator&lt;/code&gt; to allocate an &lt;code&gt;ArrayList&lt;/code&gt; of fixed capacity
(determined by &lt;code&gt;config.list_length_max&lt;/code&gt;) and then use the remaining space in the allocator for the copied data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully all is clear so far! Now we can move on to the core of the system: key/value storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key/Value Storage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps obviously, the fundamental data structure in &lt;code&gt;kv&lt;/code&gt; is a hash map, used to associate user provided keys with
user provided values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without looking too closely at the standard library, if you grab one of the provided hash map implementations, it will accept a &lt;code&gt;std.mem.Allocator&lt;/code&gt; and hold onto the allocator for the lifetime of the map. When a key/value pair
is added to the map, it will use that same allocator and request the appropriate amount of memory to store that data.
This won't work for our case though, since we need to control allocation prior to adding any data to the map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Zig also provides an "unmanaged" version of a hash map. Generally, these unmanaged versions of data structures in the standard library mean that an allocator is not held by the structure itself. It's up to us to provide that allocator when needed. A cool trick we can play with an unmanaged map is ask it to ensure it has enough capacity up front, and then "assume" that capacity during runtime when adding data to it. The hashing and internal details are still handled by the map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;var map: std.StringHashMapUnmanaged(Value) = .empty;
try map.ensureTotalCapacity(gpa, capacity);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ensure&lt;/code&gt; operation can fail with &lt;code&gt;error.OutOfMemory&lt;/code&gt;, which is OK during initialization. But, assuming this succeeds,
we no longer need to pass an allocator when we store data in the map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;store.map.putAssumeCapacity(key, value);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This could in theory fail, in which case there would an assertion failure. It's ultimately up to us to check against the map's available capacity before calling this function. But, again, no allocation is required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the map itself doesn't do any allocation at runtime, we have to provide space for incoming keys and values. We'll reuse the same &lt;code&gt;ByteArrayPool&lt;/code&gt; implementation that we used for connection buffers. Basically, we have a big space
allocated for keys and values and the hash map just maintains an association of pointers from keys to values.
The key/value data isn't literally stored "in the map." The allocation that happens in &lt;code&gt;ensureTotalCapacity&lt;/code&gt; is for
the internal book-keeping structure of the map, not for the user data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Navigating the map&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the highest level, the primary challenge with storing keys and values in a statically allocated map is that we could get poor utilization of the allocated space, especially when we need to support keys pointed at lists as values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, let's say our map is configured to allocate space for 5 keys and 5 values. If each key maps to one value, we get perfect utilization. At the other extreme, if one key maps to a value containing a list of 5 elements, we have to use all the allocated value space for this one key, preventing other keys from using any value space, causing the map to be "biased". The store wouldn't be able to hold any more key/value pairs, even though there is allocated memory "on the table."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, the only way to mitigate this is to make sure there's enough allocated space for every key to hold a list of maximum size. This definitely inflates the amount of space we have to allocate, but the alternative is a system that doesn't support its configured properties. Every key must be able to store a list of maximum size, even if they don't during actual use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another issue with static allocation in the context of a map is dealing with map deletions. Our &lt;code&gt;std.StringHashMapUnmanaged&lt;/code&gt; structure uses open-addressing and linear probing to place keys in the map when hash
collisions occur. Deletions are tricky because they can break the map's ability to know if a key is actually present
in the map. To handle this, a "tombstone" technique is used to mark a space as logically (but not physically) deleted
in order to preserve accurate lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot more to figure out here, but it's my understanding that a map will have to periodically rehash the keys in order to reclaim space if too many tombstones pile up. When this occurs is still a bit of mystery to me. If it occurs when the map needs to grow to accommodate more key/value pairs, we'll never actually trigger that condition in a static context. If it occurs at some other point, based on number of keys compared to capacity, perhaps that could work. Or maybe, it's up to us to call &lt;code&gt;rehash()&lt;/code&gt; whenever it appears there is no space left,
and try the operation again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this considered, I think a custom map implementation is more appropriate for the context of static allocation. This current implementation proves the concept, but definitely leaves room for improvement!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Revisiting allocation size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have a method for statically allocating space for these three components (connections, parsing, and storage), we can finally answer the first question: How much space do we allocate?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this current iteration of &lt;code&gt;kv&lt;/code&gt;, the answer can really only be determined after the fact, once configuration has
been set and all the allocations have been made. There are five options that can be configured by the user,
and two derived properties based on those options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub const Config = struct {
    /// Allocation is a calculated set of values (in bytes), based on the given configuration.
    /// This informs static allocation requested at initialization.
    pub const Allocation = struct {
        connection_recv_size: u64,
        connection_send_size: u64,
    };

    /// Maximum number of concurrent connections.
    connections_max: u32,

    /// Key count is the number of possible keys we can store.
    /// Internally, the store will allocate (key_count * list_length_max) number
    /// of values, such that each key could support the maximum number of list elements.
    key_count: u32,

    /// The maximum allowable key size in bytes.
    key_size_max: u32,
    /// The maximum allowable value size in bytes.
    val_size_max: u32,

    /// The maximum allowable length for a list as a value.
    list_length_max: u32,

    pub fn allocation(config: Config) Allocation {
		// ... calculate recv and send size ....
		
        return .{
            .connection_recv_size = connection_recv_size,
            .connection_send_size = connection_send_size,
        };
    }
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;connection_recv_size&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;connection_send_size&lt;/code&gt; properties of &lt;code&gt;Allocation&lt;/code&gt; depend on some details of the
RESP protocol, but is mostly informed by our user configuration. In the interest of wrapping this post up,
I'll gloss over those details, and encourage you to check out &lt;code&gt;src/config.zig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;Config&lt;/code&gt; struct doesn't directly specify every aspect of allocation, but it does provide the basis for it.
Something not listed in the &lt;code&gt;Config&lt;/code&gt; struct directly is the "list item pool", part of the key/value &lt;code&gt;Store&lt;/code&gt; struct.
When keys point to lists as values, there is a linked list backing that value in the hash map, and we need a pool of
structs to assist in the construction and iteration of that linked list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With some reasonable configuration options set, let's see just how much memory we allocate!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ zig build run
config
  connections_max = 1000
  key_count       = 1000
  key_size_max    = 1024
  val_size_max    = 4096
  list_length_max = 50
allocation
  connection_recv_size = 206299
  connection_send_size = 205255
map capacity = 2048, map size = 0, available = 1638
total_requested_bytes = 748213015
ready!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything here is measured in bytes, so we're looking at approximately &lt;code&gt;750 MB&lt;/code&gt; of memory for the given configuration.
&lt;code&gt;total_requested_bytes&lt;/code&gt; is a feature of Zig's &lt;code&gt;std.heap.DebugAllocator&lt;/code&gt;. The exact number of bytes will be different
on each run, although it will hover around that value. I think the reason for this is how Zig requests pages of
memory from the OS. It won't always be the same and the OS is very likely doing some fancy book-keeping of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you play around with the configuration options and see how &lt;code&gt;total_requested_bytes&lt;/code&gt; changes, it might be
surprising just how much memory is allocated up-front, before any of it is actually used! For example, if we
double &lt;code&gt;val_size_max&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;8192&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list_length_max&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt;, we're looking at about &lt;code&gt;2.8 GB&lt;/code&gt; of allocated memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of modern servers, this isn't a lot, but it can quickly grow as we adjust these parameters. Should we be asking ourselves: Is this inefficient? What if we don't use all that memory?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like all good engineering decisions, we have to consider them in the context of the problem we're trying to solve, and the guarantees we expect from our systems. With this design, ensuring that each request and each key/value pair can utilize the maximum configured space, seems like a worthy trade-off to make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most projects, this one took a lot longer than I expected! Trying to incorporate both &lt;code&gt;io_uring&lt;/code&gt; and
static allocation was something I had never done before, but I'm pretty happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to improving the internal hash map to better fit a static context, consider alternative allocator implementations to improve memory utilization, and incorporate fuzz testing to find the limits of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checkout the code on GitHub!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At the risk of stating the obvious, these limits can (and likely should) be configured at runtime by the user. These aren't values that have to be set at compile time and enforced upon all users in every context, although some might be. Again, it depends on which part of the system is using the memory. The point is that once the program starts it will allocate memory, but after that, it does not. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going with a single-threaded design simplifies a lot! Even though processing in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kv&lt;/code&gt;is single-threaded, it still enjoys the benefits of I/O concurrency via&lt;code&gt;io_uring&lt;/code&gt;. The kernel handles writing responses back out to clients and waiting for that operation to complete, so we don't have to worry (as much) about slow clients. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, GOG Team here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Michał Kiciński, one of the co-founders of CD PROJEKT, and the co-founder of GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why GOG and Michal Kicinski are getting together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the games that shaped us deserve to stay alive: easy to find, buy, download, and play forever. But time is annoyingly good at erasing them. Rights get tangled, compatibility breaks, builds disappear, and a nostalgic evening often turns into a troubleshooting session. That’s the difference between “I’m playing today” (the game lives on) and “I’ll play someday” (the game dies).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Michał put it: “GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński first came up with the idea for GOG in 2007, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players, and make sure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you, forever. In a market increasingly defined by mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, that philosophy feels more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new chapter is about doubling down on that vision. We want to do more to preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow, including new games with real retro spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What it means for you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever. Your library stays yours to enjoy: same access, same offline installers, same sense of ownership. Your data stays with GOG, and GOG GALAXY remains optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll keep our relationship with CD PROJEKT. CD PROJEKT RED games will continue to be available on GOG, and upcoming titles from the studio will also be released on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a GOG Patron, or you donate to support the Preservation Program, those funds stay within GOG. Your support has been huge this year, and we think that with your help, we can undertake even more ambitious rescue missions in 2026 and 2027. We’ll have more to say about that sometime in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GOG will remain independent in its operations. We will continue building a platform that’s ethical, non-predatory, and made to last, while helping indie developers reach the world. We’re also committed to giving the community a stronger voice, with new initiatives planned for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for being the reason this all matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of companies sell games. Fewer do the unglamorous work of making sure the games that shaped people’s lives don’t quietly rot into incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for caring about this mission with us. We’ll keep you posted as we ship, and in the meantime, you can dig into the full FAQ for the detailed answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is happening?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michał Kiciński, the original co-founder of GOG and co-founder of CD PROJEKT, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT. GOG will continue operating as GOG, a distinct company, with the same mission to Make Games Live Forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is GOG’s position in this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To us at GOG, this feels like the best way to accelerate what is unique about GOG. Michał Kiciński is one of the people who created GOG around a simple idea: bring classic games back, and make sure that once you purchase a game, you have control over it forever. With him acquiring GOG, we keep long-term backing that is aligned with our values: freedom, independence, control, and making games stay playable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is Michał Kiciński doing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because he wants to preserve and grow the original philosophy behind GOG. In a PC market that keeps moving toward mandatory clients and closed ecosystems, he believes GOG’s approach is more relevant than ever: no lock-in, no forced platforms, sense of ownership. His goal is to keep supporting both gamers and developers, and strengthen GOG’s mission: preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is CD PROJEKT doing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selling GOG fits CD PROJEKT’s long-term strategy. CD PROJEKT wants to focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands. This deal lets CD PROJEKT keep that focus, while GOG gets stronger backing to pursue its own mission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does the mission of GOG change?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. Our mission remains to Make Games Live Forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is DRM-free still central to GOG?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What happens to my GOG account?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing changes. Your account stays a GOG account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is GOG financially unstable?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year. In fact, we’ve seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will my tips or GOG Patrons donations be shared with Michał Kiciński, or any other party?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. These funds stay within GOG to support preservation work, and they are not shared with publishers or other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What happens to my library?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing. Your library remains yours to enjoy, even if a game gets delisted, as it always has.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I still download offline installers?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will you share my data with Michał Kiciński, or other parties?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. GOG remains the controller of your data, and nothing changes here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will CD PROJEKT RED games continue to release on GOG?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CD PROJEKT RED games will continue to be available on GOG, and upcoming titles from the studio will also be released on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Five years of tinygrad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first commit to tinygrad was October 17, 2020. It’s been almost three years since we raised money. The company is 6 people now. The codebase is 18,935 lines not including tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have spent 5 years of my life working on 18,935 lines, and now many others have put years in as well. And there’s probably 5 more years to go. But this is the right process to compete with NVIDIA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a fool begins by taping out a chip; it’s expensive and not the hard part. Once you have a fully sovereign software stack capable of training SOTA models, the chip is so easy. Note that AMD, Amazon, Tesla, and Groq have taped out fine chips, but only Google and NVIDIA chips have ever been seriously used for training. Because they have the software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are finally beginning to seriously tackle LLVM removal, making tinygrad have 0 dependencies (except pure Python) to drive AMD GPUs. We have a frontend, we have a graph compiler, we have runtimes, and we have drivers. This is no longer a toy project, it outperforms PyTorch on many workloads. When this is finished and cleaned up, it’ll be about 20,000 lines. And that’s completely it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a lot of how software is thought about is wrong. All codebases have workarounds for issues in other parts of the codebase. Sometimes you are lucky and these workarounds are clear, but many times they are so deep and structural that you’ll never see them reading the code line by line. I think this is so bad that 98% of lines of software are basically this in some way shape or form. tinygrad is following the Elon process for software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Make the requirements less dumb. The best part is no part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most requirements in software exist to maintain compatibility with other abstractions. Let’s look at an LLM server. The real requirement is that it provide an OpenAI compatible API for quickly running LLMs on GPUs. But when you look at these codebases and what they depend on, they are collectively millions and millions of lines. tinygrad is 1000x smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s because each piece of code in that stack isn’t focused on the goal. It’s focused on the other pieces of code. I believe this is the same dysfunction that exists in organizations too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tiny corp is a company, but like how fancy chefs will deconstruct dishes, the tiny corp is a deconstructed company. We have almost nothing private, it’s a Discord and GitHub. To fund the operation, we have a computer sales division that makes about $2M revenue a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also have a contract with AMD to get MI350X on MLPerf for Llama 405B training. This was negotiated mostly in public on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People get hired by contributing to the repo. It’s a very self directed job, with one meeting a week and a goal of making tinygrad better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission is to commoditize the petaflop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published on 2025-12-27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions: /r/programming, lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I maintained a big C++ codebase at my day job. This product was the bread winner for the company and offered a public HTTP API for online payments. We are talking billions of euros of processed payments a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not a seasoned C++ developer yet. I knew about undefined behavior of course, but it was an abstract concept, something only beginners fall into. Oh boy was I wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that I am not and never was a C++ expert, and it's been a few years since I have been writing C++ for a living, so hopefully I got the wording and details right, but please tell me if I did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article I always say 'struct' when I mean 'struct or class'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, one day I receive a bug report. There is this HTTP endpoint that returns a simple response to inform the client that the operation either succeeded or had an error:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "error": false,
  "succeeded": true,
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "error": true,
  "succeeded": false,
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual format was probably not JSON, it was probably form encoded, I cannot exactly remember, but that does not matter for this bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data model is not ideal but that's what the software did. Obviously, either &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;succeeded&lt;/code&gt; is set but not both or neither (it's a XOR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the bug report says that the client received this reply:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "error": true,
  "succeeded": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm ok. That should not be possible, it's a bug indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now look at the code. It's all in one big function, and it's doing lots of database operations, but the shape of the code is very simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Response {
  bool error;
  bool succeeded;

  std::string data;
};

void handle() {
  Response response;
  
  try {
    // [..] Lots of database operations *not* touching `response`.

    response.succeeded = true;
  } catch(...) {
    response.error = true;
  }
  response.write();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a godbolt link with roughly this code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's only one place that sets the &lt;code&gt;succeeded&lt;/code&gt; field. And only one that sets the &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; field. No other place in the code touches these two fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now I am flabbergasted. How is that possible that both fields are true? The code is straightforward. Each field is only set once and exclusively. It should be impossible to have both fields with the value &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, my C developer spider senses are tingling: is &lt;code&gt;Response response;&lt;/code&gt; the culprit? It has to be, right? In C, that's clear undefined behavior to read fields from &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt;: The C struct is not initialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But right after, I stumble upon official C++ examples that use this syntax. So now I am confused. C++ initialization rules are different from C, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cue a training montage with 80's music of me reading the C++ standard for hours. The short answer is: yes, the rules are different (enough to fill a book, and also they vary by C++ version) and in some conditions, &lt;code&gt;Response response;&lt;/code&gt; is perfectly fine. In some other cases, this is undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: The default initialization rule applies when a variable is declared without an initializer. It's quite complex but I'll try to simplify it here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Default initialization occurs under certain circumstances when using the syntax &lt;code&gt;T object;&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is a non struct, non array type, e.g. &lt;code&gt;int a;&lt;/code&gt;, no initialization is performed at all. This is obvious undefined behavior.&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is an array, e.g. &lt;code&gt;std::string a[10];&lt;/code&gt;, this is fine: each element is default-initialized. But note that some types do not have default initialization, such as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;int a[10]&lt;/code&gt; would leave each element uninitialized.&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is a POD (Plain Old Data, pre C++11. The wording in the standard changed with C++11 but the idea remains under the term Trivially Default Constructible) struct, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Foo foo;&lt;/code&gt; no initialization is performed at all. This is akin to doing &lt;code&gt;int a;&lt;/code&gt; and then reading &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. This is obvious undefined behavior.&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is a non-POD struct, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Bar bar;&lt;/code&gt; the default constructor is called, and it is responsible for initializing all fields. It is easy to miss one, or even forget to implement a default constructor entirely, leading to undefined behavior.&lt;p&gt;It's important to distinguish the first and last case: in the first case, no call to the default constructor is emitted by the compiler. In the last case, the default constructor is called. If no default constructor is declared in the struct, the compiler generates one for us, and calls it. This can be confirmed by inspecting the generated assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this bug, we are in the last case: the &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; type is a non-POD struct (due to the &lt;code&gt;std::string data&lt;/code&gt; field), so the default constructor is called. &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt; does not implement a default constructor. This means  that the compiler generates a default constructor for us, and in this generated code, each struct field is default initialized. So, the &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; constructor is called for the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; field and all is well. Except, the other two fields are not initialized in any way. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Type&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Example&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Result (Default Init)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Primitive (int, bool, etc)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;int x;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Indeterminate (Garbage value)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;POD / Trivial Struct&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Point p;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Indeterminate (All fields garbage)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Array of Objects&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;std::string x[10];&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Safe (All strings initialized)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Array of Primitives&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;int x[10];&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Indeterminate (All garbage)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Non-Trivial Struct&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Response r;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Calls Default Constructor (Structs ok, primitives garbage)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Any Type (Braces)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;T obj{};&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Value Initialized (Safe / Zeroed)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the only way to fix the struct without having to fix all call sites is to implement a default constructor that properly initializes every field:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Response {
  bool error;
  bool succeeded;

  std::string data;

  Response(): error{false}, succeeded{false}, data{} 
  {
  }
};
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a godbolt link with this code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, due to the rule of 6 (when I started to learn C++ it was 3), we now have to implement the default destructor, the default move constructor etc etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, we can define default values for the fields in the struct definition and avoid defining a default constructor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Response {
  bool error = false;
  bool succeeded = false;

  std::string data;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, the default constructor generated by the compiler will initialize all the fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fix at the time was to simply change the call site to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Response response{};
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a godbolt link with this code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That forces zero initialization of the &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;succeeded&lt;/code&gt; fields as well as default initialization of the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; field. And no need to change the struct definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my recommendation to my teammates at the time: do not tempt the devil, just always zero initialize when declaring a variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that in some cases, the declaration syntax &lt;code&gt;Response response;&lt;/code&gt; is perfectly correct, provided that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the default constructor of the struct is invoked, which invokes the default constructor of each field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Bar {
  std::string s;
  std::vector&amp;lt;std::string&amp;gt; vec;
};

int main() {
  Bar bar;

  // Prints: s=`` v.len=0
  // No undefined behavior.
  printf("s=%s v.len=%zu\n", bar.s.c_str(), bar.vec.size());
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to know that, you need to inspect each field (recursively) of the struct, or assume that every default constructor initializes each field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it's also worth noting that it is only undefined behavior to read an uninitialized value. Simply having uninitialized fields is not undefined behavior. If the fields are never read, or written to with a known value, before being read, there is no undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compiler (&lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt;) does not catch this issue even with all warnings enabled. This is frustrating because the compiler happily generates, and calls, a default constructor that does not initialize all the fields. So, the caller is expected to set all the uninitialized fields to some value manually? This is nonsense to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;clang-tidy&lt;/code&gt; catches the issue. However at the time it was imperfect, quoting my notes from back then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;clang-tidy&lt;/code&gt;reports this issue when trying to pass such a variable as argument to a function, but that's all. We want to detect all problematic locations, even when the variable is not passed to a function. Also,&lt;code&gt;clang-tidy&lt;/code&gt;only reports one location and exits.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, it seems it has improved, and reports all problematic locations, and not only in function calls, which is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also wrote in my notes at the time that &lt;code&gt;cppcheck&lt;/code&gt; 'spots this without issues', but when I try it today, it does not spot anything even with &lt;code&gt;--enable=all&lt;/code&gt;. So, maybe it's a regression, or I am not using it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experienced C or C++ developers are probably screaming at their screen right now, thinking: just use Address Sanitizer (or ASan for short)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's try it on the problematic code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ clang++ main.cpp -Weverything -std=c++11 -g -fsanitize=address,undefined -Wno-padded
$ ./a.out
a.out(46953,0x1f7f4a0c0) malloc: nano zone abandoned due to inability to reserve vm space.
main.cpp:21:41: runtime error: load of value 8, which is not a valid value for type 'bool'
SUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: undefined-behavior main.cpp:21:41 
error=0 success=1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, the undefined behavior is spotted! Even if the error message is not super clear. This is ASan's way of saying: "I expected a 0 or 1 for this boolean, but I found a random 8 in that memory slot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We alternatively could also have used Valgrind to the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But: it means that we now need to have 100% test coverage to be certain that our code does not have undefined behavior. That's a big ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, in my testing, Address Sanitizer did not always report the issue. That's the nature of the tool: it is meant to be conservative and avoid false positives, to avoid alerting fatigue, but that means it won't catch all issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these tools have a performance cost and can make the build process a bit more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;code&gt;libclang&lt;/code&gt; plugin at the time to catch other instances of this problem in the codebase at build time: https://github.com/gaultier/c/tree/master/libclang-plugin .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, there was only one other case in the whole codebase, and it was a false positive because by chance, the caller set the uninitialized fields right after, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Response response;
response.error = false;
response.success = true;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this &lt;code&gt;libclang&lt;/code&gt; plugin still works today because I have heard that the &lt;code&gt;libclang&lt;/code&gt; API often has breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember all these rules we have just gone through? You want more? What if we added some sweet special cases to them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types, when the value is not initialized, do not trigger undefined behavior, if they are used in certain ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::byte&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; if the underlying representation is &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, this code is perfectly valid and free of undefined behavior:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    unsigned char c;     // “c” has an indeterminate/erroneous value
 
    unsigned char d = c; // no undefined/erroneous behavior,
                         // but “d” has an indeterminate/erroneous value
 
    assert(c == d);  // holds, but both integral promotions have
                         // undefined/erroneous behavior
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this runs perfectly fine under ASan. Clang throws some warnings but compiles fine, and this is valid (in terms of the C++ standard) code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if we use &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; (for example) instead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  bool c; 
  bool d = c;
  assert(c == d);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is undefined behavior and immediately triggers ASan errors! Even if the code is the same in terms of type sizes and stack layout!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not know why the C++ standard felt the need to muddy the water even more, but they surely had a reason. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some quick research seems to indicate that these types are special cases to allow code to manipulate raw bytes like memcpy or buffer management without the compiler freaking out. Which...maybe makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this bug is C++ in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; field) makes the compiler generate completely different code at the call sites.&lt;p&gt;In contrast I really, really like the 'POD' approach that many languages have taken, from C, to Go, to Rust: a struct is just plain data. Either the compiler forces you to set each field in the struct when creating it, or it does not force you, and in this case, it zero-initializes all unmentioned fields. This is so simple it is obviously correct (but let's not talk about uninitialized padding between fields in C :/ ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end I am thankful for this bug, because it made me aware for the first time that undefined behavior is real and dangerous, for one simple reason: it makes your program behave completely differently than the code. By reading the code, you cannot predict the behavior of the program in any way. The code stopped being the source of truth. Impossible values appear in the program, as if a cosmic ray hit your machine and flipped some bits. And you can very easily, and invisibly, trigger undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We programmers are only humans, and we only internalize that something (data corruption, undefined behavior, data races, etc) is a big real issue when we have been bitten by it and it ruined our day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-Scriptum: This is not a hit piece on C++: C++ paid my bills for 10 years. I have been able to take a mortgage and build a house thanks to C++. But it is also a deeply flawed language, and I would not start a new professional project in C++ today without a very good reason. If you like C++, all the power to you. I just want to raise awareness on this (perhaps) little-known rule in the language that might trip you up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A commenter posted this Forrest Gump gif that I had completely forgotten about, so thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy what you're reading, you want to support me, and can afford it: Support me.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;When someone says they hate your product with a burning passion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What CodeRabbit did, and what to do instead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you get negative feedback in public. It’s blunt, even abrasive. You instinctively bristle: they’re wrong, they don’t get it, they’re trolling. So naturally, you push back. But your rebuttal only makes the critic double down, and now others are piling on. You clarify your position, but it only gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does this happen, and what can you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Feedback is a regulatory mechanism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a thermostat for your credibility. People form an opinion on what the correct setting should be, and they regulate if the reality seems off. If you’re above their setpoint, people feel you’re overrated and want to bring you down; if you’re below it, people feel you’re underrated and want to build you up. And the farther off you are, the more they’ll overcorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When someone is frustrated with you (or your company, or your product), they have a view of how much you should be dinged for something. Venting in public is a way to regulate your reputation and achieve the proper homeostasis, like turning a thermostat toward the desired setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that the substance of someone’s feedback is totally separate from their frustration or desire to be heard. Complaints often seem unfair and you might want to jump to fact checking, but that won’t get anywhere unless you first resolve the frustration and make people feel that you actually listened. (It turns out facts do care about our feelings.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Resistance is escalation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you reject someone’s feedback, you’re implying that (1) they’re wrong, (2) they’re possibly dumb, and (3) they don’t have the authority to judge you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, sometimes that’s all true and you need to fight or ignore. But in this case, we’re focusing on substantive feedback from people who matter, like your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By rebutting, you’re forcing them to justify and defend their initial statements. Either they were wrong to raise it or you were wrong to resist! Their choice is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now their move is to escalate further, maybe with more examples or stronger language. As this plays out, onlookers will tend to take the critic’s side, as an angry customer is more relatable than an imperious founder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Aiden v. CodeRabbit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going back to the thermostat analogy, a stubborn dial only makes people twist harder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a recent example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, Aiden Bai posted about grievances with CodeRabbit. Pretty normal so far; users complain about products all the time. A CodeRabbit engineer jumped in to ask for feedback, which was good, and Aiden followed up with details (full context here):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CodeRabbit’s CEO, Harjot, then entered the chat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one post, he&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;called his own customer clueless,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;then implied CodeRabbit had enough users that this feedback didn’t matter,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;then condescendingly speculated that, even if it were valid, it could probably be solved by “simpler controls and a lot of handholding,”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;then, to gild the lily, made sure to insult not only Aiden personally but indie developers as a category.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we should remember that writing a bad response isn’t the same as being a bad person. Harjot was frustrated by what he felt was a bad faith attack on his company, and I have a lot of sympathy for founders getting hater-fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the response was objectively not good, and what came next was predictable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The net upshot was bad vibes for CodeRabbit and a layup for its competitors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The episode finally ended with an apologish from Harjot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My advice for this kind of post is to pick a lane: if it’s an apology, make it a proper one and resist the urge to sprinkle in more veiled jabs. You could also take the other route and just not apologize. It’s best to try avoiding any uncanny valley situations. But it happens: bad interactions are unavoidable and this one wasn’t too damaging in the grand scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to reset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Dostoevsky would’ve said, all positive mentions are alike; every negative mention is irksome in its own way. It varies based on who’s involved, what the feedback is, how much traction it’s getting, etc. etc. etc. — there isn’t a universal solution. As I’ve noted, sometimes it really is bad faith trolling, and that calls for a very different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in general, as a founder you should be your own hardest critic. You should have a higher standard for yourself than anyone else could possibly impose. You should be voracious for user feedback, even if it feels unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the magical thing is, when you sincerely feel that way and you demonstrate it, criticism tends to wilt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario where you get negative feedback, and you overrule the instinct to push back. Instead, you listen to the feedback, you embrace the responsibility to make the best product possible, you even thank them for caring enough to share their thoughts (remembering that your real enemy isn’t negativity but indifference).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With just this, you’ll have shown more curiosity, more ownership, more humility than they were even hoping to enforce. They’re surprised to find that the imbalance is now in the other direction. Instead of feeling snubbed or dismissed, they might consider whether their initial jab was excessive. They now risk overcorrecting and overshooting the setpoint they were aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when people feel they’ve gone too far, they restore balance by pulling back. It’s common to see someone gearing up for a confrontation but, upon finding the other person gracious and receptive, pivot to, “Thanks for sharing the context,” “I shouldn’t have overreacted,” “I appreciate how you handled this, “I do like the product overall,” or some other form of deescalation — maybe even an apology or retraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude gets it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When getting negative feedback:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Separate the information part from the emotion part. There’s the substance of the feedback, and there’s the customer’s frustration and expectation of being heard. Those are discrete, and you can’t address the former without resolving the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start by aligning on principles, before rushing to defend yourself. Whatever the merits of the feedback, you agree that quality is important, that feedback is valuable, and that the feedback has found the person who’s responsible. Again, there’s no hope of aligning on facts if you can’t first align on principles.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Make a point of overindexing on accountability. Take more responsibility than what seems necessary. Take so much ownership that it surprises people. This obviates their need to hector you over it and removes a lot of surface area for attack, creating space for a calmer exchange. More importantly, if you’re the founder, the reality is that every detail of your product does fall on you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you need to clarify facts, explain instead of defending. You can share the exact same information in a way that’s either defensive and caustic, or earnest and transparent. The only difference is tone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If self-critique or apology is warranted (it isn’t always), keep it straightforward. No need to grovel or self flagellate. Recap the problem plainly, explain the fix, say what you’re doing to prevent it in the future, and wrap it up. Then move on.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta's generative AI ads system is having some … senior moments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advertisers have noticed the platform conjuring up bizarre ads, such as an AI granny.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The phenomenon has persisted even after brands switched off some AI-related settings.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marketers are finding out the hard way that Meta's AI tools can churn out some very strange ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that the company's artificial intelligence had become so advanced that advertisers would no longer need to create their own ads. Brands could simply hand over their bank accounts and campaign objectives and let the AI take the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some marketers, however, haven't been pleased with the results when they let Meta's AI drive their ad campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bryan Cano, head of marketing of the "elevated basics" clothing brand True Classic, was aghast when he noticed Meta had switched out his top-performing ad — an attractive millennial man in a matching fleece set, casually posing on a stool — with an AI-generated photo of a cheerful yet unnatural granny sitting in an armchair. True Classic typically targets its Meta ads to men ages 30 to 45.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ad ran on Meta for three days before customers alerted True Classic to it, Cano told Business Insider. He said that while the direction Meta is taking with AI makes sense, he felt the generative-ads tool wasn't yet ready for prime time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This doesn't just affect our relationship with customers, who were upset by this, but it could also damage relationships with wholesale customers and the relationships we have built with retailers," Cano said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we go from this… to AI grandma. pic.twitter.com/n3cryUpLaT&lt;/p&gt;— Bryan Cano (@BryanECano) October 24, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech companies, including Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, have heralded AI as a way for advertisers to speed up ad creation and enhance the performance of their campaigns. However, many advertisers are wary of ceding too much control to black box systems, particularly since consumers often have an aversion to ads that are obviously generated by AI. The AI granny is a comical example of what can happen when algorithms go unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True Classic isn't the only brand to have a chaotic Meta ad experience recently, thanks to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European footwear brand Kirruna noticed Meta's AI had whipped up an ad featuring a model whose leg had twisted around completely the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Meta generated an ad for the e-bike company Lectric, asking "What are the easiest eBikes to put in my trunk," which featured the trunk of a car. So far, so normal — except the car also appeared to be flying through clouds. Logan Young, Lectric's VP of digital marketing, said the company managed to catch the ad before it ran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We turn it all off, pretty much," Young said of Meta's AI-generated ad enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Meta spokesperson said in a statement that millions of advertisers are finding value and improved performance by using its Advantage+ creative tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Advertisers who use our full image generation feature have the opportunity to review the generated images before running their ad. We are continuously improving our products and features based on advertiser feedback," the Meta spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cano of True Classic said the AI granny ad hadn't surfaced as one of the selected ads in its campaign preview, which is why the brand was caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Surreptitious settings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what's going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertisers told Business Insider that the cause of the uncanny valley Meta ads seemed to be two tickbox settings within their accounts — "test new creative features" and "automatic adjustments" — and another group of "Advantage+ creative" settings in the area where advertisers build their campaigns. Advantage+ is the brand name for Meta's suite of AI-powered ad products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three advertisers also said they'd encountered a problem where Meta automatically switched those toggles to "on," even when they'd explicitly turned them off — meaning they inadvertently spent their budgets on AI-generated ads they didn't intend to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rok Hladnik, CEO of the marketing agency Flat Circle, which manages around $100 million in annual Meta ad spending for numerous direct-to-consumer brands, said he has encountered similar issues with Meta auto-generating bizarre ads. His company is now setting aside time two to three mornings a week to manually check that AI enhancements are switched off. The task takes up to an hour per account, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It randomly turns on, even for ads you've turned off for a second time," Hladnik said. "It's a complete mess."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jonas Vonk, founder of the e-commerce business Yuzu Knives, said he became so frustrated by how toggles like the AI-creative feature can be hidden within Meta's settings that he created his own startup, AdsFlow, which helps surface them more clearly for ad buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"You really have to dig for them, and switch them all off every time you run an ad," Vonk said of Meta's ad settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pieter Van der Auwera, a marketing consultant who runs Meta ads for the Kirruna shoe brand, said the company has had to issue two refunds to customers who complained that the items they received weren't made of the material depicted in ads generated by Meta's AI. (Remarkably, the ad featuring the model with the backward leg did a good job of replicating the real boot, he added.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van der Auwera said an issue with AI-generated ads is that while Meta provides a preview of ads prelaunch, they need to be opened one by one to check, which can be a time suck when brands run hundreds of different versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When I first heard about Meta AI, I was really hopeful and thought it would take away a lot of my work and make my work a lot faster so that I can do more for my clients," Van der Auwera said. "Now, I have more work than before."&lt;/p&gt;
