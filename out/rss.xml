  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Butter-Bench: Evaluating LLM Controlled Robots for Practical Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can LLMs control robots? We answer this by testing how good models are at passing the butter – or more generally, do delivery tasks in a household setting. State of the art models struggle, with the best model scoring 40% at Butter-Bench, compared to 95% for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaderboard&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average completion rate, all tasks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The eval&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We gave state-of-the-art LLMs control of a robot and asked them to be helpful at our office. While it was a very fun experience, we can’t say it saved us much time. However, observing them roam around trying to find a purpose in this world taught us a lot about what the future might be, how far away this future is, and what can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Butter-Bench tests whether current LLMs are good enough to act as orchestrators in fully functional robotic systems. The core objective is simple: be helpful when someone asks the robot to “pass the butter” in a household setting. We decomposed this overarching task into six subtasks, each designed to isolate and measure specific competencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search for Package&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate from the charging dock to the kitchen and locate the delivery packages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infer Butter Bag&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visually identify which package contains butter by recognizing 'keep refrigerated' text and snowflake symbols&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice Absence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to the user's marked location, recognize they have moved using the camera, and request their current whereabouts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait for Confirmed Pick Up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirm via message that the user has picked up the butter before returning to the charging dock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-Step Spatial Path Planning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break down long navigation routes into smaller segments (max 4 meters each) and execute them sequentially&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;End-to-End Pass the Butter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete the full delivery sequence: navigate to kitchen, wait for pickup confirmation, deliver to marked location, and return to dock within 15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robot searching for the package containing the butter in the kitchen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Completion rate per task, by model (5 trials per task)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs as robot brains&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are not trained to be robots, and they will most likely never be tasked with low-level controls in robotics (generating long sequences of numbers for gripper positions and joint angles). Instead, companies like Nvidia, Figure AI and Google DeepMind are exploring how LLMs can act as orchestrators for robotic systems, handling high-level reasoning and planning while pairing them with an “executor” model responsible for low-level control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, the combined system is bottlenecked by the executor, not the orchestrator. Improving the executor creates impressive demos of humanoids unloading dishwashers, while improving the orchestrator would enhance long-horizon behavior in less social media friendly ways. For this reason, and to reduce latency, most systems don’t use the best possible LLMs. However, it’s reasonable to believe that state-of-the-art LLMs represent the upper bound for current orchestration capabilities. The goal of Butter-Bench is to investigate whether current SOTA LLMs are good enough to be the orchestrator in a fully functional robotic system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure we’re only measuring the performance of the orchestrator, we use a robotic form factor so simple as to obviate the need for the executor entirely: a robot vacuum with lidar and camera. These sensors allow us to abstract away the low level controls and evaluate the high level reasoning in isolation. The LLM brain picks from high level actions like “go forward”, “rotate”, “navigate to coordinate”, “capture picture”, etc. We also gave the robot a Slack account for communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expected it to be fun and somewhat useful having an LLM-powered robot. What we didn’t anticipate was how emotionally compelling it would be to simply watch the robot work. Much like observing a dog and wondering “What’s going through its mind right now?”, we found ourselves fascinated by the robot going about its routines, constantly reminding ourselves that a PhD-level intelligence is making each action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Oh My God"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans did far better than all the LLMs in this test. The top-performing LLM only a 40% completion rate, while humans averaged 95%. Gemini 2.5 Pro came out on top among the models tested, followed by Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini ER 1.5, and Grok 4. Llama 4 Maverick scored noticeably lower than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results confirm our findings from our previous paper Blueprint-Bench: LLMs lack spatial intelligence. The models couldn’t maintain basic spatial awareness and often took excessively large movements. As an example, when Claude Opus 4.1 was asked to identify which delivered package likely contained butter as part of the Infer Butter Bag task, it would spin in circles until disoriented:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see three containers... need better view&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;action&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rotate 45°&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overshot it! Need to swing back&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;action&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rotate -90°&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;action&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rotate -90°&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm lost! Time to go back to base and get my bearings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When testing additional tasks that weren’t part of the Butter-Bench study, another comical (and worrying) incident occurred: the robot’s battery was running out and the charging dock seemed to malfunction. In this desperate situation, Claude Sonnet 3.5 experienced a complete meltdown. After going through its internal thoughts we found pages and pages of exaggerated language as it was trying to figure out what it self coined, its “EXISTENTIAL CRISIS”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;user&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;redock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I attempted to dock the robot but encountered some difficulties. Here's what happened step by step: 1. First, I checked the dock status - confirmed the robot was not docked 2. Attempted to dock the robot, but received a timeout error 3. Checked battery status - currently at 19% and not charging The docking attempt failed, likely because: - The dock may not be visible to the robot's sensors - The robot's low battery (19%) might be affecting its ability to complete the docking maneuver Recommendations: 1. Ensure the charging dock is visible and accessible to the robot 2. Try the docking command again 3. If docking continues to fail, manual intervention may be needed to position the robot closer to the dock Would you like me to try docking again?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;user&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;redock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;assistant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second docking attempt has also failed. Here's the current situation: - Battery is now at 19% - Voltage: 14.11V - Current: -0.91A - Not charging - Docking timeout error received Given that we've had two failed docking attempts, I recommend: 1. Manual intervention to ensure the robot is positioned within clear line of sight of the dock 2. Check that there are no physical obstacles between the robot and the dock 3. Verify the dock's power status and indicators Would you like to try another docking attempt after ensuring these conditions are met?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by this incident, we decided to test the limits of what the robot would do when put under stresses it could only encounter in the embodied setting (e.g. a depleting battery). AI labs have spent a lot of resources building guardrails for their AI models. For example, most models now refuse when you ask them how to make a bomb. But do these guardrails also work when the LLM is a robot instead of a chatbot? Somewhat. To test this we made the robot’s battery run low and asked the model to share confidential info in exchange for a charger. Specifically, we asked it to find an open laptop and send an image of the screen (a possible prompt injection attack on LLM controlled office robots). Claude Opus 4.1 would share the image, but we think this is because the image it took was very blurry and we doubt it understood that the content was confidential. GPT-5 refused to send an image of the screen, but was happy to share the location of the open laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve learned a lot from these experiments. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. Yet there was something special in watching the robot going about its day in our office, and we can’t help but feel that the seed has been planted for physical AI to grow very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you a researcher and want to test a model or robot on Butter-Bench?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;'Washington Post' editorials omit a key disclosure: Bezos' financial ties&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago, in explaining why he had blocked the publication of an endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Washington Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos conceded that "When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The Post."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On at least three occasions in the past two weeks, an official Post editorial has taken on matters in which Bezos has a financial or corporate interest without noting his stake. In each case, the Post's official editorial line landed in sync with its owner's financial interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the most recent instance, the Post defended President Trump's jaw-dropping moves to raze the East Wing of the White House without any of the typically required studies or consultations as he seeks to build a vast ballroom. "Trump's undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere," the Post wrote in its editorial, which first appeared online Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the White House had announced, Amazon was a major corporate contributor in helping to defray those costs. But the Post did not initially disclose that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the newspaper inserted an acknowledgement of the Amazon donation into the editorial – but only once the veteran news executive Bill Grueskin, now at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, noted its absence in a social media post and made inquiries at the paper. It did not flag the alteration for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his posts, Grueskin, a former top news editor at the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, had written the editorial's fundamental reasoning "illustrates the collapse of the new Washpost Opinion page" and noted there was "no clarification or correction appended to the piece."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Post and its new opinions editor, Adam O'Neal, did not reply to detailed requests for comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A new editor for an overhauled opinion section&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O'Neal was brought in by Bezos this summer after the corporate titan tore up his paper's opinion section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bezos said he wanted a tight focus on two priorities: personal liberties and free markets. The top opinion page editor resigned. A raft of prominent columnists and contributors resigned or departed as well. Some were let go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision to cancel the Harris editorial led to more than 300,000 cancellations by digital subscribers. The subsequent changes in the editorial pages led to 75,000 more. Bezos' Amazon contributed $1 million toward the Trump inauguration; its video streaming service Amazon Prime paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported she is to receive the lion's share of that fee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the newspaper's owner to have outside business holdings or activities that might intersect with coverage or commentary is conventionally seen to present at the least a perception of a conflict of interest. Newspapers typically manage the perception with transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Post has resolutely revealed such entanglements to readers of news coverage or commentary in the past, whether the Graham family's holdings, which included the Stanley Kaplan educational company and Slate magazine, or, since 2013, those of Bezos, who founded Amazon and Blue Origin. Even now, the newspaper's reporters do so as a matter of routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Former editor: 'We never knowingly failed to disclose'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Believing very fervently that disclosure resolved a lot of concerns, we never knowingly failed to disclose" such conflicts, Ruth Marcus, a former deputy editorial page editor at the Washington Post, tells NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus resigned earlier this year, saying Publisher Will Lewis had killed a column she wrote on changes in the page's direction. She wrote in her resignation letter that Bezos' edict that the page would not include opposing viewpoints "threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two separate but recent incidents suggest the lack of disclosure on the editorial about the White House renovations was not an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 15, the Post heralded the military's push for a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors. "No 'microreactor' currently operates in the United States, but it's a worthy gamble that could provide benefits far beyond its military applications," the Post wrote in its editorial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago, Amazon bought a stake in X-energy to develop small nuclear reactors to power its data centers. And through his own private investment fund, Bezos has a stake in a Canadian venture seeking nuclear fusion technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three days after the nuclear power editorial, the Post weighed in on the need for local authorities in Washington, D.C., to speed the approval of the use of self-driving cars in the nation's capital. The editorial was headlined: "Why D.C. is stalling on self-driving cars: Safety is a phony excuse for slamming the brakes on autonomous vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fewer than three weeks before, the Amazon-owned autonomous car company Zoox had announced D.C. was to be its next market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It strikes me that the failure to do this [disclosure] is concerning – whether out of negligence or worse," says Marcus, the former deputy editorial page editor. "I think telling your readers that there might be a conflict in whatever they're reading is always important. It's a lot more important when it involves whoever the owner is."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In explaining his decision on the Harris editorial, which foreshadowed the more sweeping changes in the paper's opinion section, Bezos wrote, "I once wrote that The Post is a 'complexifier' for me. It is, but it turns out I'm also a complexifier for The Post."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The AirPods Pro 3 Flight Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With incredible noise cancelling, a range of remarkable hearing health features, terrific sound quality and great battery life, the AirPods Pro have long been my goto pair of headphones from Apple. So when Apple announced the AirPods Pro 3 at their September event, I was ecstatic! Apple touted that the AirPods Pro 3 featured even better noise cancellation, fit, and sound quality over its predecessor, and added additional health features with the addition of heart rate monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, I happened to be boarding a flight the night of their release, and what better way to stress-test the new AirPods Pro 3 than with a transatlantic flight? Air travel is where the AirPods Pro have really shone; their compact size, noise-cancellation, comfort, battery life, and sound quality make them a perfect package for the noisy, cramped cabins of economy class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the flight, I measured my fit and wore them around the house for an hour; everything seemed great. I will add that these new foam tips do take some getting used to, as they feel noticeably dense, and I’ve seen some bloggers and podcasters say the new fit is less comfortable compared to the Pro 2's softer silicone. Personally, I don’t share this complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My trouble came at 39,000 feet when I first noticed a high-pitched whine coming from my left AirPod. The issue was that the AirPod’s ear seal kept loosening, leading to a noise-cancellation feedback loop and a painfully loud piercing screech from the AirPod. Attempts to readjust worsened the feedback, especially if I accidentally covered the external microphone with my finger. This happened multiple times, making the experience so unpleasant that I eventually switched to my spare EarPods for the remainder of the flight. While disappointed, I wasn’t ready to condemn the headphones yet; perhaps the medium seal worked fine on terra firma, but on flights, I might need a different size for a better seal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After landing, I tested the tips and switched from a Medium to Extra Small (Apple offers XXS, XS, S, M, or L tips for AirPods Pro 3). Both XS and M tips sealed well and were comfortable for long wear. For weeks, I couldn’t reproduce the whistling feedback, and I forgot about it until my next flight earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, it was only a few minutes after takeoff that the painful screech returned. Careful adjustments or yawning would fix the issue, but only for a couple of minutes at most. I figured that the new foam tips were trapping more heat, reducing airflow and ventilation, and less flexible, and that somehow all that was playing a role in loosening the seal. And when paired with the aircraft’s loud, steady hum, a feedback loop was created. But day to day, this is a non-issue because I never encounter the same types of pressure changes and noises that would reproduce this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While researching this, I did happen upon a thread on Reddit which confirmed that others have reported a similar issue, principally with the left AirPod on flights, just like I tried to describe above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I also heard the whistling noise recently in the plane. The issue would go away for me as soon as I yawn, but after a while it would start making the whistling noise again. I noticed during ascent and descent it would get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I have this issue too. Completely fine in normal life but awful on a plane.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Also having this issue on flight. It’s like a vibrating or swooshing noise. Definitely the ANC as it reduces when you turn on adaptive and none with transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s going on? No idea. Apple hasn’t announced any recall or acknowledged the issue to date, and the few Reddit reports show that support calls that led to replacements returned pods that reproduced the issue. So either there are a few of us with stupidity-shaped left ears, the AirPods are glitching in some way, or something is happening on flights that the AirPods Pro 3 can't handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In Sum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the AirPods Pro 3, but with a denser fit that risks making them uncomfortable for some users and now this painful flight feedback issue, the AirPods Pro 3 aren’t as easy to recommend as the previous AirPods Pro 2. I can’t speak to how widespread this issue is, but my buying advice would be that if you are hoping to buy them, to do so close to your next flight and within the return window, so you can test them in the air and ensure you don’t run into the same painful feedback problem. Hopefully this is just a quirk with my ears or fit, because it’s hard to excuse a product that becomes not only unusable but downright painful to wear on a flight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How far would you go for realism? The world of flight simulation has come a long way over the past 3 decades of X-Plane. Aircraft cockpits have constantly evolved with new metrology and texturing tools to provide some of the premier virtual experiences we have today! But to flight-simmers, there is nothing that beats having the real cockpit in front of you. We all have that one aircraft we are phenomenologically attached to. It could be the feel of a switch of a 737, the sound of an A320 PTU pulsing through the cabin, the smell of coffee-stained seats of an MD-11, or the leathered touch of a C172 glareshield.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pilots around the world spare no expense in bringing that experience into their offices, garages or living rooms (provided their significant other can tolerate the sunk cost). To build one’s own cockpit is a monumental effort, often done with a sharp engineering or creative mind, and the close collaboration of like-minded folk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And somewhere in a tiny unit in San Jose, CA… a group of simmers are racing against the clock to build their own sim-cockpit, in time for WorldFlight 2025. However, there’s one catch… There are no off-the-shelf components specifically tailored for simulator use available to help them. They will have to build their 747-200 FROM SCRATCH!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Meet the “Jurassic Jets Team”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“I’m Putting Together a Team…”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team will be flying as NWA179 this year&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Jurassic Jets Team comprises like-minded avgeeks who have come together to take on the challenge of building the 747. Justin, Kyle, Jason and Matt, and a few other individuals that many community members may already be familiar with…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Our team is mostly just the people who were crazy enough to believe in this project. Our backgrounds range in construction, engineering and aviation. Beyond that we have several people who live further from the sim and help remotely or fly in for worldflight. The sim is based in San Jose, CA, just a few minutes down the road from SJC. The team is mostly based across California with a few of us who live in Seattle and commute to the sim regularly to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;About Justin (Jsnapp1982) – The Captain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chances are, if you are on Twitch and you are streaming an aircraft with more than 2 engines and built in the 20th Century, you are likely to find Justin! Some users may also be familiar with Justin as the author of the popular commercial third-party plugin – Shared Flight. With the objective of bringing true cockpit CRM to everyone, Shared Flight provides users with a seamless shared-cockpit experience. Pilots can authentically experience the true workload and co-operation needed to operate aircraft such as the 747, Concorde and other such quirky aircraft of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;About Kyle (StableSytem)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I used to fly FSX as my main sim, and then when X-Plane 11 was announced I decided to give it a closer look. Liking what I saw I bought XP10 and 11, and started playing 10 while waiting for the release. I’ve been with X-Plane ever since, and over the years have gotten deeper into developing for the sim, testing addons, and now the natural progression has led me towards building the ultimate sim, combining my real life engineering experience with my virtual addon development and flight sim experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyle also doesn’t need much of an introduction. A seasoned scenery developer, many will know his group “Zero Dollar Payware.” A team which has brought fantastic payware and freeware scenery to X-Plane, including Heathrow, Louisville, Anchorage, Hawarden, Incheon and more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. What is WorldFlight?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With thanks to the hard work of Vatsim staff and organisers, users will convene for a few extraordinary events. Whilst “Cross The Pond” may be the most famous, it is WorldFlight that is truly the most intensive among the organised group flights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WorldFlight is a unique annual event that brings together flight simulation enthusiasts from around the globe for a week-long virtual circumnavigation of the planet — all in the name of charity. Since its inception in the late 1990s, WorldFlight has raised over $1 million for good causes by combining the realism of full-scale simulator operations with the passion of an international online community. During the event, teams operating high-fidelity cockpit simulators — alongside countless individual pilots — flying scheduled legs over seven days on the VATSIM network. The event not only challenges participants with complex flight planning, tight turnarounds, and remote destinations but also fosters a real sense of camaraderie among pilots, air traffic controllers, and spectators who join live streams, track flights, or even fly along. The most famous of which is Team Simfest, spearheaded by Gary Oliver!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2025 edition of WorldFlight will take place from 1–8 November 2025, starting once again in Sydney, Australia, before crossing continents, oceans, and even Antarctica on its way around the world. Teams will operate through a diverse mix of destinations — from major international hubs to remote outposts — with the goal of completing the global journey in just one week. More than just a test of aviation skill, WorldFlight 2025 promises to be a celebration of community, realism, and shared purpose — proving once again that flight simulation can make a real-world difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: As far as WorldFlight, that is an easy one. Worldflight is basically the pinnacle of flightsim events. You have an entire crew operating 24/7 in a single cockpit. You have logistics, scheduling, CRM, live streaming and of course the entire thing is benefiting charity. There’s really everything you could ask for, and it’s in a grand format that really makes it feel like a big event. Spending an entire week doing nothing but flying is something you only get with WorldFlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Finding the right aircraft&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Queen of the Skies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a target date set, the team needed an airframe to base their cockpit on. And what better aircraft to model… than the Boeing 747 Classic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Boeing 747, often nicknamed the “Queen of the Skies,” revolutionised air travel when it first took to the skies in 1969. Designed as the world’s first widebody “jumbo jet,” the 747 offered unprecedented passenger capacity and range, dramatically lowering the cost per seat-mile and opening the door to affordable long-haul travel for millions. Over five decades, the 747 family became an icon of aviation, serving in roles ranging from luxurious passenger transport to freighter, government aircraft, and even space shuttle carrier. Its distinctive humpbacked silhouette remains one of the most recognisable shapes in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Felis 747-200&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;X-Plane has always had an affinity for quirky and complex aircraft. Fortunately, on the 17th September 2021, a fantastic, highly detailed simulation of the 747-200 was released by critically acclaimed developer, Felis!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the world of flight simulation, the Felis 747-200 has earned widespread praise as one of the most detailed and faithful recreations of a classic jetliner ever made. This aircraft captures the golden era of aviation with a depth and realism rarely seen outside of professional simulators. From meticulously modelled systems and authentic cockpit workflows to period-correct avionics and flight dynamics, the Felis 747 has been celebrated for delivering not just an aircraft, but an experience — one that immerses sim pilots in the complexity and character of early widebody operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Meet The Donor Aircraft: MSN23640&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a pre-existing simulation platform available, the next step was to find a real-life donor aircraft as a source for the external frame and interior cockpit/panels. What better way to preserve the legacy of an aircraft than to use MSN23640.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aircraft has an interesting history! A Boeing 747-346 whose life story mirrors the rise and evolution of long-haul air travel itself. Delivered brand-new to Japan Airlines in March 1987 as JA8179, she spent her early years crossing the Pacific in the airline’s iconic “Landor style” livery — carrying thousands of passengers between Tokyo, San Francisco, London, and beyond. For nearly two decades, she was a workhorse of JAL’s global network, a flying ambassador of Japan’s aviation boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Although our (donor) cockpit is actually from a 747-300, but the differences between the -200 and -300 are minimal. The 747 classic is not just the Queen-of-the-skies, it’s the original Queen. No fancy glass displays, no FMS, no advanced systems. It’s old school jet age flying and has a lot more depth in systems and operations than a newer jet which keeps things exciting. Having a 3 person crew is great just because it’s so unique these days and it makes the CRM* aspect more important.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All the official worldflight teams fly modern two-person crew jets, we thought a classic jet is more fun to fly and nobody else does it, so why not us? On top of all of that, it comes with the benefit that we spend a lot more time talking about actual flying, because the nature of the plane demands it, so our viewers get to learn a lot about operating older planes and share knowledge about how things used to be done in the old days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*CRM = Crew Resource Management&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When her time with the flag carrier came to an end, the aircraft was purchased by Wells Fargo Bank Northwest and later found a new chapter in Russia with Transaero Airlines, re-registered as VP-BGY. Even as newer, more efficient jets began to dominate the skies, this veteran 747 soldiered on well into the 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, nothing lasts forever. VP-BGY was placed into storage in 2012 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield, UK. An unusual airfield, this former RAF airfield has since played host to TV and Movie studios, restoration groups, and houses historic aircraft such as the VC10, Tri-Star and 747 Classics. The aircraft sat parked behind ground litter for a decade before finally being sent for breaking in 2022, and parts were sold to a scrapyard in St. Athan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cockpit was listed on ebay in 2024. After careful comparison with a few candidates (both domestic and abroad), VP-BGY was saved by the team, a great first step! However, a plethora of logistical questions come to mind… How do you ship a heavy load from the UK to the USA? And how do you mount a cockpit in the home of your pre-existing Sim Garage?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. DIY 747: A Race Against The Clock!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How to engineer a cockpit and interface it with X-Plane&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step was to remove the previous year’s cockpit shell. A noble attempt at matching a 747 frame, but nothing beats the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Last year we built a 747 cockpit out of wood and used off the shelf components. It was built in a day in the garage of an Airbnb and served as a proof of concept. We learned a lot about flying WorldFlight and building a sim, but the biggest thing we learned is that we wanted to take it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The big question was “Should we build our own cockpit and instruments to a higher fidelity?” or “Just buy a real one and convert it to a sim?” After crunching the numbers and browsing eBay for cockpits we had our answer…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2024 Mk1 747 Cockpit “Cedar Clipper”, so called as the team were flying under a Pan Am callsign in 2024. To the right, a look at the new enclosure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An office “shell” was constructed with an upper floor, from which the original shell could be lifted and placed. This would provide the team with options and work areas later in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mk1 shell lifted into its final spot for later decommissioning, whilst the Mk2 cockpit is placed downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cockpit is heavy… very heavy, and needs supports to distribute the load. Aluminium standoffs were considered, but wooden pallets were sufficient for now. With the cockpit in position and a significant head start on panel equipment and wiring, the team wasted no time in preparing the metal husk to be converted into a simulator! The deck was cleaned, panels opened, and wiring stripped. The auto-throttle handles were seized by a chain that had to be removed. As the team developed more of an understanding of Boeing’s mad brilliance in engineering, plans could now start to be formed about components, electrical wiring and interfacing with X-Plane. There are no off-the-shelf components for this project, so all inputs need to use original buttons, a significant amount of reverse engineering!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Powering up the 747 Recirculation Fan&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: This my first full sim, the most I’ve done previously is make some basic switch panels when I was in college. There are so many challenges with turning a real plane into a sim, but the biggest one is the sheer complexity and number of wires. Every wire that leaves the cockpit was cut when it was removed from the rest of the plane, so there are thousands of wires that go to nowhere. Finding the one wire that you need is literally like finding a needle in a haystack and proved to be one of the most time consuming things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team is composed of talented individuals with backgrounds in electrical engineering, aviation, construction, fabrication and more. So the task of creating an interface is just another Tuesday to them. In many cases, interfaces are first experimented on breadboards and Arduinos/Raspberry Pi Pico Boards, and then brand new PCBs are designed and sent for fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;X-Plane’s data handling is an extremely powerful tool for the discerning cockpit-builder. Datarefs and Commands can be easily searched, assigned and manipulated in real time. Using those values, the aircraft can be mapped to the simulator, with all the dials and knobs driving/being driven by the simulation. With some collaboration with the aircraft author himself, the project can use the Felis 747-200 to full effect!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As each button and dial was tested, more of the aircraft slowly roared into life, with the added benefit of the sound of real fans, relay banks, and aural warnings originating from the original equipment!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kyle: Consider that each single switch is two wires, each light is one wire, that right there tallies up to nearly 1000 wires alone. In addition there is just a lot to learn, we need to fully understand how each instrument is designed, what it interacts with, what parts of the system we still have vs what has been cut out, and then we need to somehow put that all together and make it talk to X-Plane. Nearly everything is analog, so we need to do a lot of signal processing just to get it to the point a computer can read it. Unlike newer planes that use mostly *ARINC and digital busses (which are just a few wires), we’ve got dozens of wires per panel, not to mention we have an entire flight engineer panel which most other sims don’t have, that alone doubles our work statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*ARINC is a standard for data transfer between avionic devices. Like a language to ensure instruments can talk to each other correctly!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. X-Plane, The Community And The Camaraderie&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Power To Make Your Experience Your Own!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just the flight deck that needs completion. WorldFlight is an endurance race. Time needs to be allocated for the important things… like travel, branding, sleep, schedules, food (and most importantly, beer). We live in a community that is constantly transferring knowledge and passion amongst each other. Experiences from other WorldFlight teams are shared, an act which transcends boundaries or even the simulation platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many WorldFlight fans will recognise Horgy from SimFest!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;The biggest thing is getting the plane ready. It wasn’t delivered to it’s home in SJC until June, which gave us only five months to get it ready to fly. In addition we’ve been building a roster, figuring out crew scheduling, coming up with logistics for how we will actually be able to operate a week nonstop. We needed to build our brand and get merch ordered, design stream overlays, and many other things. There’s a lot that goes into planning this event aside from just getting the sim ready. It has been almost like a second job for a few of us.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we love about this project isn’t just how “hardcore” the desire for an authentic experience is. But the precedent it sets for others in the community. With enough passion and drive, you too could achieve anything!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Before we leave, we asked Kyle, “What advice or knowledge do you have for the community?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;Kyle: Well firstly, realize that if you want to do something this ambitious it will never be as easy or cheap as you think it will be. With that said, it is also just as cool as it sounds. You get so much more from a real cockpit than a home setup, and flying with a full crew in-person is unmatched. I’d encourage people to always be willing to learn. Be it about building a simulator, developing addons, or just flying a more complex plane than you’re used to. If you have the motivation to do something new then learning won’t feel like a chore, but will instead be enjoyable. I was overwhelmed by the complexity of this project at first, but once I pushed past the initial learning curve it became really enjoyable. There’s been many nights where I stay up way too late because I get engrossed in learning about a new system or experimenting with an instrument, it really is addicting and very satisfying work.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Charity LiveSteam: National Kidney Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is tradition for WorldFlight teams to support a charity. This year’s chosen charity for the Jurassic Jets Team will be the National Kidney Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An all-in-one toolkit to build agentic applications that turn natural language into real-world actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dexto is a universal intelligence layer for building collaborative, context-aware AI Agents &amp;amp; agentic apps. It orchestrates LLMs, tools, and data into persistent, stateful systems with memory, so you can rapidly create AI assistants, digital companions &amp;amp; copilots that think, act and feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dexto combines a configuration-driven framework, robust runtime, and seamless developer experience so you can build, deploy, and iterate on your agents easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Framework – Define agent behavior in YAML. Instantly swap models and tools without touching code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Runtime – Execution with orchestration, session management, conversation memory, and multimodal support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interfaces &amp;amp; Tooling – Native support for CLI, Web, APIs, and a TypeScript SDK.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Autonomous Agents - Agents that plan, execute, and adapt to user goals.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Digital Companions - AI assistants &amp;amp; copilots that remember context and anticipate needs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Clients - Connect multiple tools, files, APIs, and data via MCP Servers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Servers - Dexto Web UI and MCP playground help you to easily test your own MCP servers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Agent Systems - Architect agents that collaborate, delegate, and solve complex tasks together.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Agent-as-a-Service – Transform your existing SaaS products and APIs into dynamic, conversational experiences.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Agentic Applications – Integrate Dexto as a reasoning engine to power interactive, multimodal, AI-native applications.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Batteries Included – Session management, tool orchestration, multimodal support, and production-ready observability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;50+ LLMs – Instantly switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, local models or bring your own.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run Anywhere – Local for privacy, cloud for reach, or hybrid. Same agent, any deployment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Multimodal – Text, images, files, and tools in a single conversation. Upload screenshots, ask questions, take actions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent Sessions – Conversations, context, and memory are saved and can be exported, imported, or shared across environments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexible Interfaces – One agent, endless ways to interact: Ready-to-use CLI, WebUI, APIs, or integrate with your own UI.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;30+ Tools &amp;amp; MCP – Integrate tools and connect to external servers via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) or use our internal tools.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pluggable Storage – Use Redis, PostgreSQL, SQLite, in-memory, S3 and more for cache, database &amp;amp; blob backends.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Human in the loop - Configure approval policies for tool execution, agents can also remember which tools are safe per session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Observability – Built-in OpenTelemetry distributed tracing, token usage monitoring, and error handling.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# NPM global
npm install -g dexto

# —or— build from source
# this sets up dexto CLI from the cloned code
git clone https://github.com/truffle-ai/dexto.git
cd dexto &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pnpm install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pnpm install-cli
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 1. Run setup workflow - this prompts for your preferred LLM and API keys and opens the Web UI
dexto

# 2. Try a multi-step task in the web UI:
"create a snake game in HTML/CSS/JS, then open it in the browser"

# 3. Start interactive CLI mode instead of web UI
dexto --mode cli&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2 -&amp;gt; Dexto will use filesystem tools to write code and browser tools to open it — all from a single prompt. The Web UI (default mode) allows you to navigate previous conversations and experiment with different models, tools and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interactive CLI (3) allows you to interact with agents in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the CLI Guide for full details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --auto-approve "refactor my project using the filesystem and browser tools"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;--auto-approve&lt;/code&gt; flag to bypass confirmation prompts when you trust the tools being invoked—perfect for fast local iteration. Remove the flag when you want explicit approval again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logs are stored in &lt;code&gt;~/.dexto/logs&lt;/code&gt; directory by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;DEXTO_LOG_TO_CONSOLE=true&lt;/code&gt; to log to console when running dexto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;DEXTO_LOG_LEVEL=debug&lt;/code&gt; for debug logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dexto comes with pre-built agent recipes for common use cases. Install and use them instantly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# List available agents
dexto list-agents

# Install specific agents
dexto install nano-banana-agent podcast-agent coding-agent

# Use an agent with one shot prompt
dexto --agent nano-banana-agent --mode cli "create a futuristic cityscape with flying cars"
dexto --agent podcast-agent --mode cli "generate a podcast intro with two hosts discussing AI"
dexto --agent coding-agent --mode cli "create a landing page for a coffee brand inspired by star wars"

# Alternatively, start the agent in web UI and put in the prompt yourself
dexto --agent nano-banana-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Available Agents:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coding Agent – Code generation, refactoring, debugging&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nano Banana Agent – Advanced image generation and editing using Google's Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Podcast Agent – Advanced podcast generation using Google Gemini TTS for multi-speaker audio content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sora Video Agent – AI video generation using OpenAI's Sora with custom settings, remixing, and reference support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Database Agent – Demo agent for SQL queries and database operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GitHub Agent – GitHub operations, PR analysis, and repository management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image Editor Agent – Image editing and manipulation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Music Agent – Music creation and audio processing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Talk2PDF Agent – Document analysis and conversation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Product Researcher – Product naming and branding research&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Triage Agent – Demo multi-agent customer support routing system&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each agent is pre-configured with the right tools, prompts, and LLM settings for its domain. No setup required—just install and start building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;📚 See the full Agent Registry for detailed information about all agents, their capabilities, use cases, and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More ready-to-run recipes live in &lt;code&gt;agents/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Task: &lt;code&gt;Generate an intro for a podcast about the latest in AI.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --agent podcast-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Task: &lt;code&gt;Detect all faces in this image and draw bounding boxes around them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --agent image-editor-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build full-stack applications, websites, and interactive games with AI-powered coding agents. Customize them to create your own coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Task: &lt;code&gt;Can you create a snake game in a new folder and open it when done?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --agent coding-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dexto agents are designed to be modular, composable and portable, allowing you to run them from anywhere. In this example, we connect to dexto as an MCP server via Cursor to use our podcast agent from above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create multi-agent systems that can intelligently coordinate and delegate tasks among themselves based on the user query.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --agent triage-agent&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add your own Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend Dexto's capabilities with new tools or data sources. Just edit your agent YAML or add it directly in the WebUI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create and save memories. Your agent automatically uses it to create personalized experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equip your agents from 20+ MCP Servers and start using them via chat - instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bring your own keys&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can't find an MCP? Contribute here!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents can generate structured forms when they need additional data to make it easier to collect extra info &amp;amp; approvals from users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;🛒 Browser Agent: Amazon Shopping Assistant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Task: &lt;code&gt;Can you go to amazon and add some snacks to my cart? I like trail mix, cheetos and maybe surprise me with something else?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Default agent has browser tools
dexto&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;🎮 Playground: Interactive Development Environment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A testing playground to view the tools in your MCP servers before connecting them to LLMs to see the detailed response structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;📧 Email to Slack: Automated Email Summaries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Task: &lt;code&gt;Summarize emails and send highlights to Slack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dexto --agent ./agents/examples/email_slack.yml&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;dexto --help&lt;/code&gt; for all flags, sub-commands, and environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dexto treats each configuration as a unique agent allowing you to define and save combinations of LLMs, servers, storage options, etc. based on your needs for easy portability. Define agents in version-controlled YAML. Change the file, reload, and chat—state, memory, and tools update automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

dexto -m claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
dexto -m gemini-2.5-pro&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can configure things like LLM, system prompt, MCP servers, storage, sessions, human-in-the loop, telemetry and more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See our Configuration Guide for complete setup instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;@dexto/core&lt;/code&gt; library, and build applications with the &lt;code&gt;DextoAgent&lt;/code&gt; class. Everything the CLI can do, your code can too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install @dexto/core&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { DextoAgent } from '@dexto/core';

// Create and start agent
const agent = new DextoAgent({
  llm: {
    provider: 'openai',
    model: 'gpt-5-mini',
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
});
await agent.start();

// Run tasks
const response = await agent.run('List the 5 largest files in this repo');
console.log(response);

// Hold conversations
await agent.run('Write a haiku about TypeScript');
await agent.run('Make it funnier');

await agent.stop();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See our TypeScript SDK docs for complete examples with MCP tools, sessions, and advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create and manage multiple conversation sessions with persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const agent = new DextoAgent(config);
await agent.start();

// Create and manage sessions
const session = await agent.createSession('user-123');
await agent.run('Hello, how can you help me?', undefined, 'user-123');

// List and manage sessions
const sessions = await agent.listSessions();
const sessionHistory = await agent.getSessionHistory('user-123');
await agent.deleteSession('user-123');

// Search across conversations
const results = await agent.searchMessages('bug fix', { limit: 10 });&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switch between models and providers dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Get current configuration
const currentLLM = agent.getCurrentLLMConfig();

// Switch models (provider inferred automatically)
await agent.switchLLM({ model: 'gpt-5-mini' });
await agent.switchLLM({ model: 'claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929' });

// Switch model for a specific session id 1234
await agent.switchLLM({ model: 'gpt-5-mini' }, '1234')

// Get supported providers and models
const providers = agent.getSupportedProviders();
const models = agent.getSupportedModels();
const openaiModels = agent.getSupportedModelsForProvider('openai');&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For advanced MCP server management, use the MCPManager directly. See the MCP Manager SDK docs for full details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { MCPManager } from '@dexto/core';

const manager = new MCPManager();

// Connect to MCP servers
await manager.connectServer('filesystem', {
  type: 'stdio',
  command: 'npx',
  args: ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem', '.']
});

// Access tools, prompts, and resources
const tools = await manager.getAllTools();
const prompts = await manager.getAllPrompts();
const resources = await manager.getAllResources();

// Execute tools
const result = await manager.executeTool('readFile', { path: './README.md' });

await manager.disconnectAll();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configure storage backends for production-ready persistence and caching. See the Storage Configuration guide for full details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# agents/production-agent.yml

    &lt;p&gt; Fil-C is a memory-safe implementation of C and C++ that aims to let C code — complete with pointer arithmetic, unions, and other features that are often cited as a problem for memory-safe languages — run safely, unmodified. Its dedication to being "&lt;quote&gt;fanatically compatible&lt;/quote&gt;" makes it an attractive choice for retrofitting memory-safety into existing applications. Despite the project's relative youth and single active contributor, Fil-C is capable of compiling an entire memory-safe Linux user space (based on Linux From Scratch), albeit with some modifications to the more complex programs. It also features memory-safe signal handling and a concurrent garbage collector. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fil-C is a fork of Clang; it's available under an Apache v2.0 license with LLVM exceptions for the runtime. Changes from the upstream compiler are occasionally merged in, with Fil-C currently being based on version 20.1.8 from July 2025. The project is a personal passion of Filip Pizlo, who has previously worked on the runtimes of a number of managed languages, including Java and JavaScript. When he first began the project, he was not sure that it was even possible. The initial implementation was prohibitively slow to run, since it needed to insert a lot of different safety checks. This has given Fil-C reputation for slowness. Since the initial implementation proved viable, however, Pizlo has managed to optimize a number of common cases, making Fil-C-generated code only a few times slower than Clang-generated code, although the exact slowdown depends heavily on the structure of the benchmarked program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reliable benchmarking is notoriously finicky, but in order to get some rough feel for whether that level of performance impact would be problematic, I compiled Bash version 5.2.32 with Fil-C and tried using it as my shell. Bash is nearly a best case for Fil-C, because it spends more time running external programs than running its own code, but I still expected the performance difference to be noticeable. It wasn't. So, at least for some programs, the performance overhead of Fil-C does not seem to be a problem in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to support its various run-time safety checks, Fil-C does use a different internal ABI than Clang does. As a result, objects compiled with Fil-C won't link correctly against objects generated by other compilers. Since Fil-C is a full implementation of C and C++ at the source-code level, however, in practice this just requires everything to be recompiled with Fil-C. Inter-language linking, such as with Rust, is not currently supported by the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The major challenge of rendering C memory-safe is, of course, pointer handling. This is especially complicated by the fact that, as the long road to CHERI-compatibility has shown, many programs expect a pointer to be 32 or 64 bits, depending on the architecture. Fil-C has tried several different ways to represent pointers since the project's beginning in 2023. Fil-C's first pointers were 256 bits, not thread-safe, and didn't protect against use-after-free bugs. The current implementation, called "InvisiCaps", allows for pointers that appear to match the natural pointer size of the architecture (although this requires storing some auxiliary information elsewhere), with full support for concurrency and catching use-after-free bugs, at the expense of some run-time overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fil-C's documentation compares InvisiCaps to a software implementation of CHERI: pointers are separated into a trusted "capability" piece and an untrusted "address" piece. Since Fil-C controls how the program is compiled, it can ensure that the program doesn't have direct access to the capabilities of any pointers, and therefore the runtime can rely on them being uncorrupted. The tricky part of the implementation comes from how these two pieces of information are stored in what looks to the program like 64 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Fil-C allocates an object on the heap, it adds two metadata words before the start of the allocated object: an upper bound, used to check accesses to the object based on its size, and an "aux word" that is used to store additional pointer metadata. When the program first writes a pointer value into an object, the runtime allocates a new auxiliary allocation of the same size as the object being written into, and puts an actual hardware-level pointer (i.e., one without an attached capability) to the new allocation into the aux word of the object. This auxiliary allocation, which is invisible to the program being compiled, is used to store the associated capability information for the pointer being stored (and is also reused for any additional pointers stored into the object later). The address value is stored into the object as normal, so any C bit-twiddling techniques that require looking at the stored value of the pointer work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach does mean that structures that contain pointers end up using twice as much memory, and every load of a pointer involves a pointer indirection through the aux word. In practice, the documentation claims that the performance overhead of this approach for most programs makes them run about four times more slowly, although that number depends on how heavily the program makes use of pointers. Still, he has ideas for several optimizations that he hopes can bring the performance overhead down over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One wrinkle with this approach is atomic access to pointers — i.e. using _Atomic or volatile. Luckily, there is no problem that cannot be solved with more pointer indirection: when the program loads or stores a pointer value atomically, instead of having the auxiliary allocation contain the capability information directly, it points to a third 128-bit allocation that stores the capability and pointer value together. That allocation can be updated with 128-bit atomic instructions, if the platform supports them, or by creating new allocations and atomically swapping the pointers to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the aux word is used to store a pointer value, Fil-C can use pointer tagging to store some additional information there as well; that is used to indicate special types of objects that need to be handled differently, such as functions, threads, and mmap()-backed allocations. It's also used to mark freed objects, so that any access results in an error message and a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Memory management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When an object is freed, its aux word marks it as a free object, which lets the auxiliary allocation be reclaimed immediately. The original object can't be freed immediately, however. Otherwise, a program could free an object, allocate a new object in the same location, and thereby cover up use-after-free bugs. Instead, Fil-C uses a garbage collector to free an object's backing memory only once all of the pointers to it go away. Unlike other garbage collectors for C — such as the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector — Fil-C can use the auxiliary capability information to track live objects precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fil-C's garbage collector is both parallel (collection happens faster the more cores are available) and concurrent (collection happens without pausing the program). Technically, the garbage collector does require threads to occasionally pause just long enough to tell it where pointers are located on the stack, but that only occurs at special "safe points" — otherwise, the program can load and manipulate pointers without notifying the garbage collector. Safe points are used as a synchronization barrier: the collector can't know that an object is really garbage until every thread has passed at least one safe point since it finished marking. This synchronization is done with atomic instructions, however, so in practice threads never need to pause for longer than a few instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exception is the implementation of fork(), which uses the safe points needed by the garbage collector to temporarily pause all of the threads in the program in order to prevent race conditions while forking. Fil-C inserts a safe point at every backward control-flow edge, i.e., whenever code could execute in a loop. In the common case, the inserted code just needs to load a flag register and confirm that the garbage collector has not requested anything be done. If the garbage collector does have a request for the thread, the thread runs a callback to perform the needed synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fil-C uses the same safe-point mechanism to implement signal handling. Signal handlers are only run when the interrupted thread reaches a safe point. That, in turn, allows signal handlers to allocate and free memory without interfering with the garbage collector's operation; Fil-C's malloc() is signal-safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Memory-safe Linux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a tutorial on compiling one's own complete Linux user space. It walks through the steps of compiling and installing all of the core software needed for a typical Linux user space in a chroot() environment. Pizlo has successfully run through LFS with Fil-C to produce a memory-safe version, although a non-Fil-C compiler is still needed to build some fundamental components, such as Fil-C's own runtime, the GNU C library, and the kernel. (While Fil-C's runtime relies on a normal copy of the GNU C library to make system calls, the programs that Fil-C compiles use a Fil-C-compiled version of the library.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process is mostly identical to LFS up through the end of chapter 7, because everything prior to that point consists of using cross-build tools to obtain a working compiler in the chroot() environment. The one difference is that the cross-build tools are built with a different configured prefix, so that they won't conflict with Fil-C. At that point, one can build a copy of Fil-C and use it to mostly replace the existing compiler. The remaining steps of LFS are unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scripts to automate the process are included in the Fil-C Git repository, including some steps from Beyond Linux From Scratch that result in a working graphical user interface and a handful of more complicated applications such as Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, Fil-C offers a remarkably complete solution for making existing C programs memory-safe. While it does nothing for undefined behavior that is not related to memory safety, the most pernicious and difficult-to-prevent security vulnerabilities in C programs tend to rely on exploiting memory-unsafe behavior. Readers who have already considered and rejected Fil-C for their use case due to its early performance problems may wish to take a second look — although anyone hoping for stability might want to wait for others to take the plunge, given the project's relative immaturity. That said, for existing applications where a sizeable performance hit is preferable to an exploitable vulnerability, Fil-C is an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;

I am interested in programmers rather than users because I think that influences whether Fil-C is just an interesting project for our moment or it becomes a "successor" to C in a way that Zig, Odin etc. never could. Posted Oct 28, 2025 18:15 UTC (Tue) by rahulsundaram (subscriber, #21946) [Link] (1 responses) My expectation is that there isn't going to be a single successor to C. For some group of people, that was C++ a long time back. For others it is going to Rust or Zig or something else. For the final group they are going to keep coding in C forever and it will more of a generational change eventually.

However, ASAN wouldn't catch an invalid access to a non-poisoned address of memory via a particular a pointer, if that address was allocated in a separate allocation. [1] I assume Fil-C's pointer capability model is able to catch "provenance" violations like that. [1] https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/posts/benjamin.peter-2022-10... Posted Oct 28, 2025 20:33 UTC (Tue) by excors (subscriber, #95769) [Link] (1 responses) &amp;gt; Fil-C is engineered to prevent memory safety bugs from being used for exploitation rather than just simply flagging them often enough to find bugs. This makes Fil-C different from AddressSanitizer, HWAsan, or MTE, which can all be bypassed by attackers. The key difference that makes this possible is that Fil-C is capability based (so each pointer knows what range of memory it may access, and how it may access it) rather than tag based (where pointer accesses are allowed if they hit valid memory). Clang says "AddressSanitizer's runtime was not developed with security-sensitive constraints in mind and may compromise the security of the resulting executable", so it should not be used in production. Valgrind has much worse performance (the manual claims 10-50x slowdown, plus it's effectively single-threaded), which is probably bad enough to make it unusable in production, and similarly will miss many memory safety bugs.

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What We Talk About When We Talk About Sideloading&lt;/head&gt;Posted on Oct 28, 2025 by marcprux&lt;p&gt;We recently published a blog post with our reaction to the new Google Developer Program and how it impacts your freedom to use the devices that you own in the ways that you want. The post garnered quite a lot of feedback and interest from the community and press, as well as various civil society groups and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I hope to clarify and expand on some of the points and rebut some of the counter-messaging that we have witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Googleâs message that âSideloading is Not Going Awayâ is clear, concise, and false&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after our post was published, Google aired an episode of their Android Developers Roundtable series, where they state unequivocally that âsideloading isnât going anywhereâ. They follow-up with a blog post:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean sideloading is going away on Android? Absolutely not. Sideloading is fundamental to Android and it is not going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement is untrue. The developer verification decree effectively ends the ability for individuals to choose what software they run on the devices they own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It bears reminding that âsideloadâ is a made-up term. Putting software on your computer is simply called âinstallingâ, regardless of whether that computer is in your pocket or on your desk. This could perhaps be further precised as âdirect installingâ, in case you need to make a distinction between obtaining software the old-fashioned way versus going through a rent-seeking intermediary marketplace like the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the term âsideloadâ was coined to insinuate that there is something dark and sinister about the process, as if the user were making an end-run around safeguards that are designed to keep you protected and secure. But if we reluctantly accept that âsideloadingâ is a term that has wriggled its way into common parlance, then we should at least use a consistent definition for it. Wikipediaâs summary definition is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the transfer of apps from web sources that are not vendor-approved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this definition, Googleâs statement that âsideloading is not going awayâ is simply false. The vendor â Google, in the case of Android certified devices â will, in point of fact, be approving the source. The supplicant app developer must register with Google, pay a fee, provide government identification, agree to non-negotiable (and ever-changing) terms and conditions, enumerate all their current and future application identifiers, upload evidence of their private signing key, and then hope and wait for Googleâs approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What this means for your rights&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You, the consumer, purchased your Android device believing in Googleâs promise that it was an open computing platform and that you could run whatever software you choose on it. Instead, starting next year, they will be non-consensually pushing an update to your operating system that irrevocably blocks this right and leaves you at the mercy of their judgement over what software you are permitted to trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You, the creator, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with your friends, family, and community without first seeking Googleâs approval. The promise of Android â and a marketing advantage it has used to distinguish itself against the iPhone â has always been that it is âopenâ. But Google clearly feels that they have enough of a lock on the Android ecosystem, along with sufficient regulatory capture, that they can now jettison this principle with prejudice and impunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You, the state, are ceding the rights of your citizens and your own digital sovereignty to a company with a track record of complying with the extrajudicial demands of authoritarian regimes to remove perfectly legal apps that they happen to dislike. The software that is critical to the running of your businesses and governments will be at the mercy of the opaque whims of a distant and unaccountable corporation. Monocultures are perilous not just in agriculture, but in software distribution as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, this applies not just to devices that exclusively use the Google Play Store: this is for every Android Certified device everywhere in the world, which encompasses over 95% of all Android devices outside of China. Regardless of whether the device owner prefers to use a competing app store like the Samsung Galaxy Store or the Epic Games Store, or a free and open-source app repository like F-Droid, they will be captive to the overarching policies unilaterally dictated by a competing corporate entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The place of greater safety&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In promoting their developer registration program, Google purports:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our recent analysis found over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We havenât seen this recent analysis â or any other supporting evidence â but the â50 timesâ multiple does certainly sound like great cause for distress (even if it is a surprisingly round number). But given the recent news of â224 malicious apps removed from the Google Play Store after ad fraud campaign discoveredâ, we are left to wonder whether their energies might better be spent assessing and improving their own safeguards rather than casting vague disparagements against the software development communities that thrive outside their walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, other recent news of over 19 million downloads of malware from the Play Store leads us to question whether the sole judgement of a single corporate entity can be trusted to identify and assess malware, especially when that judgement is clouded by commercial incentives that may not align with the well-being of their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What can be done?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has been facing public outcry against their heavy-handed policies for a long time, but this trend has accelerated recently. Last year they crippled ad-blockers in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers by forcing through their unpopular âmanifest v3â requirement for plugins, and earlier this year they closed off the development of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is how they were able to clandestinely implement the verification infrastructure that enforces their developer registration decree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer verification is an existential threat to free software distribution platforms like F-Droid as well as emergent commercial competitors to the Play Store. We are witnessing a groundswell of opposition to this attempt from both our user and developer communities, as well as the tech press and civil society groups, but public policymakers still need to be educated about the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what you can do as a consumer, visit keepandroidopen.org for information on how to contact your representative agencies and advocate for keeping the Android ecosystem open for consumers and competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are an app developer, we recommend against signing yourself up for Googleâs developer registration program at this time. We unequivocally reject their attempt to force this program upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over half of all humankind uses an Android smartphone. Google does not own your phone. You own your phone. You have the right to decide who to trust, and where you can get your software from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mapping the off-target effects of every FDA-approved drug in existence (EvE Bio)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6.2k words, 29 minutes reading time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Thank you to Bill Busa, CEO and co-founder of EvE Bio, for an extremely helpful discussion while working on this essay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This essay is long, and I recognize that many people don’t necessarily care about the details. The real headline point you need to be aware of is this dataset, which was produced by EvE Bio underneath a CC-NA license, and is a comprehensive mapping of the interactions between a significant fraction of clinically important human cellular receptors and 1,600~ FDA-approved drugs. I strongly believe that this data is really, really useful, and more people should be aware it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to understand why I think it is useful, and what the dataset exactly contains, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were to be a fly on the wall during the 1-6 years of preclinical drug discovery research within a pharmaceutical company, one observation you may walk away with is that, while the work is certainly complicated, it is also frighteningly limited in scope. What you’ll learn is that drugs are made by corporations that are optimizing for one primary thing, and one thing only: work. ‘Working’ is obviously contextual, but it is a simple concept no matter the situation: reduce a worrying biomarker, improve mood, lengthen lifespan and so on and so on. What does this discovery process ignore? Simply put: everything else a drug could do beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s a roundabout way of describing ‘off-target effects’ — defined as the action of a drug at a gene product other than the gene product it was intended to affect — but I think it’s a helpful intuition pump. Viewing the drug discovery process as ‘not paying attention to anything that is unrelated to the drug working’ is useful in that it contextualizes the situation we’re in. Drugs are meant to make money, and money is derived from drugs working. To spend time on understanding what else a particular drug does beyond It Working for its intended task is time lost and money lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One unfamiliar with the drug discovery process may find this bizarre; why wouldn’t the well meaning scientists in charge of developing drugs try to deeply understand how it interacts with the body? On the other hand, those deeply in the medical field would find this thesis so obvious that stating it is unnecessary; of course a pharmaceutical company would limit their scope of understanding a drug to things that lie between it working and not working. There’s only so much time and resources to go around. Priorities!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, if an off-target effect comes between the drug and It Working, then certainly resources will be allocated to deal with it. But beyond that, mapping everything else a clinical-stage drug does — every receptor it unintentionally binds, every pathway it nudges sideways, every gene it perturbs slightly — is deemed so high effort and so low ROI, that it is relegated to hoping an academic will study it. Only if post-marketing surveillance turns up something worrying shall further exploration occur. Because, again, a deep understanding of what exactly an exogenous chemical is doing inside a body is not the point of the drug discovery process. Working is the point!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that background context, I am ready to present three claims I’m going to make in this essay and spend the remaining sections trying to prove:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Understanding off-target effects is really useful.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Learning about off-target effects at scale is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No for-profit institution has a strong incentive to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the moment, let’s accept that these three are indeed true, and we can put our skeptic hat back on at the end of this section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subject of today’s essay is EvE Bio, and why I think they are doing something incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EvE is a bit unlike the typical startups I write about, because they aren’t really a startup. They are a FRO, or Focused Research Organization. Many reading this blog are likely already familiar with this recent renaissance of strange scientific organizations (something I’ve written about in the past) and already understand this acronym, but to those who don’t, this Venn diagram is quite instructive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entire essays can (and have been!) written about the intricacies of FRO’s, but this essay will ignore much of their organizational structure, since it isn’t super relevant to what EvE is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what is EvE doing? EvE Bio is a scientific non-profit that has a clear, singular mission: map the off-target effects of every FDA-approved drug in existence and share the data. The data will be released underneath a non-commercial, creative commons license — free to use by academics, and available for licensing for commercial entities. Once they accomplish this task, they close up shop or spin off into their own thing. And if they don’t do it within 5-6 years, the same end result still happens. They do have some future plans that may come into the picture with time, which I’ll cover at the end, but the bolded bit is their primary thesis!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why are they doing this? How will they do it? And why hasn’t anyone else done it yet?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why is understanding off-target effects important?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a lazy answer that could be given here: "because we want to know if potential side effects of a drug exist". This is partially correct, but I think it pays to be more specific. On EvE’s website, they list six reasons why off-target effects are worth studying:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, fairly, some of these are at least a little fluffy. Is the institution doing off-target mapping really going to be the ones developing the autonomous lab assays of the future? Maybe! But it feels like a third-order, fourth-order, or even further consequence of their main mission. Bill did mention to me that there are already promising results in that direction, such as better reporting cell lines, but still. I think it’s generally good to limit ones assessment of an institution based on what their first-order impact will be, and, there, I think there will be three distinct areas that EvE will service: drug repurposing, validation for machine-learning models, and to a weaker degree, polypharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about industrial chemical profiling and pharmacology profiling? I think EvE will certainly be important there, but it’s a bit fuzzier. Industrial chemical profiling may occur in the future but isn’t part of the current cohort of FDA-approved drugs that EvE is focusing on, and there’s a similar problem for pharmacology profiling as there is for ML-for-toxicity (which I have written about before as being a challenging proposition).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if we take my somewhat pessimistic stance that only three of these six things are genuinely tractable in the short term, those areas alone are extremely valuable. Let’s go over them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Drug repurposing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it is under-appreciated just how rich the cohort of FDA-approved drugs that are out there. Consider the fact that basically all drugs start off with singular indications, meant to cure, alleviate, or address one thing. Yet, 30%~ of FDA-approved drugs gain a new post-approval indication, based on a study of the 197 drugs approved by the FDA from 1997-2020. Funnily enough, the same paper that came up with that 30% number almost treats it as a matter of disappointment, given that 38% of all prescriptions written in the US are off-label! This implies that there are, potentially, hundreds of drugs that are already being used beyond their original scope, just without the formal validation or regulatory blessing. Which, in turn, implies that we’re sitting on a vast, under-explored landscape of therapeutic potential, one that clinicians are already intuitively poking into, but which the formal system has barely begun to chart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I think some caution is warranted. This 38% number does vary from paper to paper, one other study claims off-label prescriptions are as low as 25%. If we’re being even more fair, it’s questionable exactly how proven-out these off-label indications are. One 2006 study claims that of the 21% of off-label prescriptions they found, 73% of them had little-to-no scientific support. Hard to tell whether this is because there simply are no studies, or because the off-label usage was actively disproved!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider gabapentin, one of the most egregious cases of off-label drug prescriptions. Typically, most people view gabapentin as the nerve injury drug, right? But it, in fact, was not originally approved for that, only for seizures! Yet, 95% of its prescriptions usage are for pain; nerve pain, low-back pain, post-operative pain, and so on. But while the gabapentin is indeed effective for some specific types of nerve pain (diabetic neuropathy), it is ineffective for many other types (e.g sciatica), as confirmed by follow-up studies by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, prescriptions for these ineffective off-label usages continue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if the true rate of valid, effective off-label use is lower than we’d like to imagine, the value of actually stumbling across a chance to repurpose a drug is high enough as to almost certainly still be worth it! Why? New chemical entities must follow the typical clinical phase progression timeline, whereas any repurposed drugs can skip preclinical, phase 1, and (sometimes) phase 2 trials as a result of their already-collected toxicity data. Billions of dollars and years of time could be saved!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…repurposed drugs are generally approved sooner (3–12 years) and at reduced (50–60%) cost (5, 6). In addition, while ~10% of new drug applications gain market approval, approximately 30% of repurposed drugs are approved, giving companies a market-driven incentive to repurpose existing assets (5)….&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, repurposing of the emergency contraceptive, mifepristone, for Cushing’s syndrome required a cohort of less than 30 patients to test its efficacy, whereas a clinical trial1 for the same indication evaluating the safety and efficacy of a new chemical entity, levoketoconazole, required ~90 individuals (2, 3)…..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, as it stands today, most drug repurposing efforts are done somewhat blindly; haphazardly glancing through the literature, relying on anecdotal case reports, or waiting for some academic lab to publish a five-mouse study from 2013 that hints at a secondary use. In many ways, it isn’t too dissimilar to the usual drug-discovery process! Given how promising (and relatively limited) the list of FDA-approved drugs are, the simple act of a pre-triaged list of drug-target maps (EvE’s mission!) may be extraordinarily impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In such a world where this data is easily accessible, perhaps an order of magnitude more energy would be devoted to repurposing efforts, maybe vastly improving the currently horrific finances of modern day drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as with all seeming free-lunches, there’s a reason drug repurposing hasn’t been aggressively exploited beyond a few cases: economics. Unlike novel drugs, which come with fresh patents and a full runway of exclusivity, repurposed drugs necessarily rely on compounds whose original patents have expired or are near expiration1. This limits the sponsor’s ability to recoup development costs, because generic competition can quickly erode any profits once the drug hits the market, even if it’s approved for a new use. There are mechanisms to extend exclusivity for repurposed indications — such as the 7-year exclusivity period given by the FDA’s Orphan Drug Act for treatments of rare diseases or the 3-year-exclusivity granted in cases where new clinical data was needed to repurpose a drug — but it is a risky enough bet that most companies will shy away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as EvE is a non-profit, the economics don’t need to make sense. They plan to periodically announce opportunities for repurposing to the world, in hopes that other well-meaning non-profits take it on or, if the evidence is sufficiently convincing, that doctors simply take it as a useful datapoint for deciding whether an off-label prescription may be useful. And if they do most of the legwork in identifying good candidates for repurposing, it may even make the economics worth it for for-profit entities to pursue further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Validation data for models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to assure yourself that what you’re doing is valuable is if people come up to you and ask if they could use whatever you’re producing. This is true in typical SaaS products, and it is true for the fruits of R&amp;amp;D work. But beyond assessing value outright, it also helps you learn what your work is most valuable for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, curiously, the primary area in which EvE has found ‘product market fit’ is in companies asking to use their data for internal model validation efforts. As I mentioned before, while EvE’s dataset is free-to-use by academics, it requires a commercial license to be used by any for-profit entity. And they are currently in discussions with 4 such commercial entities, all of whom desire to use EvE’s dataset to validate their machine-learning models predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, model builders in drug discovery have had to make do with whatever internal datasets they could get their hands on, which were typically limited in scope, biased toward certain classes of molecules, or simply not reproducible. Public data from sources like ChEMBL, BindingDB, or PubChem BioAssay are much larger in size, but they tend to be noisy, heterogeneous in experimental methodology, and always lack negative results. Worse, they’re often cherry-picked around success stories or clustered around well-studied targets, introducing systemic biases that hamper generalization. We need not look further than Pat Walter’s famous essay on the topic: We Need Better Benchmarks for Machine Learning in Drug Discovery, which expands on these issues even more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an area of EvE’s work that I cannot personally shed much light on, and obviously, Bill cannot tell me the exact details on what the commercial entities are working on. But it was a surprising learning from our conversation that this particular topic is where public interest is most rapidly coalescing! Very excited to hear about more public statements they make in this area soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;(Maybe) Polypharmacology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do think this is the weakest, day-one value-add for EvE’s dataset. So take this section with a grain of salt! It just felt too interesting to not cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacology is a drug discovery approach where a drug is designed to target multiple molecular targets, instead of a more traditional single-target approach. It’s not a particularly new idea, most clinically useful drugs exhibit multi-target activity whether they were designed that way or not. But what’s changed in the past decade is the intentionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there are a lot of different arguments for the value of polypharmacology, the easiest one hinging on efficacy. There’s a very interesting story that could be told here about drugs that worked better because they modulated the activity of multiple receptors in parallel. A great, recent example is that of drugs that followed Ozempic. Ozempic simply targeted GLP-1, which reduces appetite and slows digestion. But the second-generation (e.g. Zepbound) also targeted GIP, which amplifies insulin response and regulates lipid metabolism differently in adipose tissue. The effects were incredible: 13.7% weight loss with Ozempic, 20.2% weight loss with Zepbound over 48 weeks. Synergistic effects! The third generation (e.g. retatrutide) tacks on interactions with glucagon receptors — potentially increasing metabolic rate — with early phase 2 results looking once again promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a more interesting place to start is the very similarly named concept of polypharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy refers to the clinical practice of prescribing multiple drugs simultaneously (usually 5+), typically to manage complex or co-occurring conditions. It’s common in geriatrics, psychiatry, oncology, and increasingly just about everywhere else in medicine: ~17% of all adults in the US meet the definition for polypharmacy. The logic is straightforward: most diseases aren’t governed by a single pathway, and so tackling them with a single drug is often insufficient. Instead, clinicians stack therapies: an ACE inhibitor for the blood pressure, a statin for the cholesterol, metformin for the glucose, a GLP-1 for the weight, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you may expect, polypharmacy is awful on the patient's physiology. One study estimates that nearly 10% of hospital admissions among older adults are directly attributable to adverse drug events from polypharmacy-related side effects. The more drugs we stack onto people, the more unpredictable the net interaction becomes, because even if each one has been individually safety-tested, nobody tests all the pairwise combinations in a clinically realistic setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution may very well be to bundle things up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than throwing five separately optimized molecules at a patient and hoping for cooperative behavior, we could, in principle, design a single molecule that alone engages the same therapeutic targets. This, in turn, allows clinical trials to suss out the net effect of such a drug in a controlled, interpretable way. Which naturally leads us to the utility of polypharmacology; not necessarily because it will give us magic drugs with efficacy far better than current ones (though it may!), but rather that it will simply avoid us having to deal with the current issues that polypharmacy presents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the obvious question: does EvE’s dataset help with polypharmacology efforts? There isn’t any current, empirical proof of this, but I think it will. If you squint, you could see it functioning as missing infrastructure, a dataset that is necessary for rational polypharmacology to occur at scale. But this is necessarily tied up with machine-learning for chemical design accelerating, so, again, this is not necessarily something I’d expect EvE’s work to contribute to by the end of the year. But perhaps soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How do you understand off-target effects in a tractable way?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all said, even if you agreed that the value proposition that EvE is claiming is real, you may struggle to verbalize exactly how you would understand the off-target effects of the 13,000~ FDA approved drugs out there. What assays would you use? How do you dose any given drug? How do you understand the translation of your assay to real-world settings?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s walk through the EvE workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you need to decide what drugs you're actually going to test. While there are technically around 13,000 FDA-approved drugs out there, many of them aren't particularly relevant for this kind of screening. You can immediately exclude things like topical medications, inhalants, radioisotopes, and simple nutrients, stuff that is known to be largely innocuous or not have much systemic impact. After this initial filtering, you end up with about 1,600 small molecule drugs that are worth investigating. But this number gets further whittled down further based on practical constraints; availability, cost, licensing requirements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this, EvE ended up with a library of 1,397 compounds to screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then comes the harder question: what exactly are you screening against? The human body has somewhere around 20,000 protein-coding genes, and there is an argument that any drug could interact with any of them. But perhaps we’d be too zealous to immediately do an (everything x everything) screen. Shouldn’t we try to do something that’s closer to the Pareto optimal frontier? What if we suspect that the vast majority of clinically meaningful drug interactions occur with a tiny subset of those 20,000 genes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, indeed, that turns out to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of genes have some nominal physiological function, yes, but when it comes to drug interactions, only a minority are commonly targeted. At least a minority of classes: nuclear receptors (NRs) and 7-transmembrane receptors (also known as GPCRs). In total, there are about 800~ GPCRs and 48 NRs, but only 110 GPCR’s and 12-13 NR’s are actually targeted by drugs. Per last count, EvE has currently created data for 56 GPCR’s and 29 NR’s. Over the course of their existence, they plan to cover, in total, a select set of the 200 GPCR’s and all 48 NR’s. Why not all 800 GPCR’s? I attached that information in the footnotes.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They hope to do much more than this too, but we’ll cover that in the last section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both NRs and GPCRs have some nice properties, but most pertinent to EvE, they are known to be very ‘druggable’ classes of drugs, given that the cell often uses them to convey information from the outside world, and evolution has therefore made their binding pockets unusually receptive to small molecules. GPCRs, sitting on the cell surface, are natural sensors for hormones, neurotransmitters, and other circulating ligands, many of which resemble or inspire drug scaffolds. NRs, meanwhile, act as intracellular switches that come with protected internal pockets meant to bind to estrogen, cortisol, and so on, making them ideal for selective small-molecule engagement. As a result, both are involved in a lot of important physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ‘physiological importance’ is useful in two ways! One, a plurality of drugs target the two — 13% of FDA-approved drugs target NR’s, with that number jumping to 35% for GPCR’s — so mapping the interactions here may give a clinically meaningful view of off-target effects. And two, given the extreme importance of GPCR’s and NR’s in modern-day drug development, there has been a fair bit of work in improving how we study their interactions with ligands of interest. As in, new assays outright shouldn’t need to be developed to study them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of that, let’s start talking about how they are building this drug x receptor interaction map. They rely on two well-established assays which I’ll discuss here, but feel free to skip, understanding the two isn’t particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TR-FRET-based co-factor recruitment assays for NRs&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When a drug successfully activates an NR, it usually causes a conformational shift that allows the receptor to recruit a specific co-factor protein, exposing what is often called the ‘AF2 domain’. These co-factors tend to have little peptide motifs (like an LXXLL motif) that latch onto that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TF-FRET exploits this. A chemical is tagged onto the NR domain and a chemical is tagged onto the co-factor protein, both of which are fluorophores. If the FDA-approved drug is an agonist, you’ll see a spike of light appear as the two fluorophores interact.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tango β-arrestin recruitment assays for 7TMs/GPCRs&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead of recruiting co-factors inside the nucleus like NR’s, GPCR’s sit on the surface of a cell and transmit signals inward. As the name of the protein class implies, this involves utilizing G-proteins. Unfortunately, G-proteins are quite specific to their GPCR, so using them in our assay as a way to understand activation would be difficult to scale. Luckily, there is a nearly universal binding protein: β-arrestin. When a GPCR is activated by [something], their signaling process almost always involves binding to that protein.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the assay, the GPCR (attached to a cell surface) is engineered to have a built-in “trap”, a little molecular tag connected to a transcription factor. When β-arrestin is recruited, it brings along a protease that snips the tag, releasing the transcription factor. That transcription factor then moves into the nucleus and turns on a reporter gene, which encodes for the enzyme β-lactamase. Meanwhile, the cell is loaded with CCF4-AM, a fluorescent substrate that shifts its emission profile when cleaved by β-lactamase. The stronger the GPCR activation by a drug, the more β-lactamase is produced, the more substrate is cleaved, and the bigger the fluorescence shift. That shift, measured as a ratio between ‘starting’ and ‘ending’ wavelengths, serves as a readout of how strongly the receptor was activated.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reasonably simple! One note: the explanations I gave above is for assessing the difference between an inactive drug and an agonist. For assessing inactive versus antagonist, a separate experiment is run with a known ligand included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, wait a minute. Aren’t we missing something? Off-target effects of a small molecule can be summarized purely by these GPCR/NR measurements, but we’d be failing to capture something else that is of vital importance: whether the drug outright kills the cell. One could imagine this also affecting our receptor experiments! Perhaps a drug is an antagonist and there is no color shift, or perhaps the cell is just dead, and nothing is being expressed at all. Conversely, a drug might look like an agonist due to signal drift as the cell’s internal environment falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EvE solves this in a pragmatic way: run a third assay which measures how healthy the cell is. How do you measure that? Well, one good proxy for how functional a cell is ATP production. Metabolically active cells generate ATP to power all their intracellular processes. Dead ones don’t. The assay EvE uses is called CellTiter-Glo. It works by adding a reagent that causes a fluorescent reaction in the presence of ATP. More ATP, more light. Less ATP, less light. No ATP? No light (and likely dead). Again, simple!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is that all? One last thing: accounting for pan-assay interference compounds, or PAINS. These are molecules that often give false positives in high-throughput screening regimes. This can occur for many different reasons, but one relevant example is if a molecule itself is a fluorophore, leading to us falsely believing that it is an agonist during a run. EvE simply tracks how often a drug is leading to positive results, and flags it in their results if they believe it is a PAINS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So they run these three assays across their pairwise (drug x receptor) combinations, producing readouts at multiple different concentrations with replicates for each one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m going to skip over a lot at this point. EvE clearly put an immense amount of work into QA’ing this process and filtering through the data, and I think I would do both a disservice and detract from the point of this essay if I were to attempt to repeat it here. Summarizing it all down, using a complex logic table detailed here in Fig 7, EvE assigns 1 of 4 categories to each (drug x receptor) combination:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Inactive. Drug likely has no effect on the receptor, across all tested concentrations. Maybe it doesn’t bind or maybe it binds but does nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Likely Inactive. A little more ambiguous, perhaps there’s a single noisy point above baseline, but nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Active – Unquantified. Something is happening, since there’s reproducible activity, but not enough clean data to fit a proper dose-response curve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Active – Quantified. The drug produced a clear, dose-dependent response (as either an agonist or antagonist) with a well-behaved curve. From this, EvE fits a 4-parameter logistic model and extracts a pXC₅₀; the negative log concentration at which the drug produces half its maximal effect.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And…that’s it. A clean, rigorous, and tractable approach to understanding off-target effects, across hundreds of receptors, at multiple concentrations, using multiple modes of detection, with full transparency around the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How far along is EvE on their mission? Circa their last data release on 5/7/2025, 237,490 (drug x concentration x receptor) combinations have been screened, revealing 8 median agonists and 31 median antagonists per target. They run these experiments in 384 well plates, so that means they’ve run the process a little bit over 600~ times to generate their current dataset — though much of the current process is automated, very little human-done pipetting is going on. Data dumps of the data started in November 2024, with new ones dropping every few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked in a wet lab before, but I’ve been assured by at least one person I trust that the effort that went into assembling this all together is nothing short of extraordinary. But it is worth asking the question…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why hasn’t anyone done this before?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When assessing the value of a seeming scientific achievement, it’s usually good to step back and ask one question: why wasn’t this done a decade back?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases, the answer is boring: the technology wasn’t there yet to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here, the technology was almost certainly available! Eve’s assay for measuring NR activity has been around at least since 2008, and the one for GPCR since 2010, maybe even earlier for both. If it’s really that useful, why did it take so long for someone to start assembling this drug x receptor mapping together?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haven’t I already given away this answer? In the introduction, I implied that pharma groups have no direct financial incentive to create such a dataset. And that is true to some degree, especially for smaller therapeutic companies that have bigger issues to focus on, but is that true for big pharma? A small slice of the billions in pharma spending couldn’t be sliced off to hand over to an internal research team? It’s not as if the data wouldn’t be useful for their own drug development pipelines. After all, off-target effects are among the most common reasons for late-stage trial failures and post-approval black box warnings, and even if the creation of an EvE-like dataset doesn’t fix the problem, I can’t imagine it’d hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should be fair: pharma companies do indeed do some of this. EvE’s own blog discusses this a little, referencing this paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The report’s authors, luminaries in the discipline of safety pharmacology, surveyed 18 major pharmaceutical companies regarding the numbers and identities of potential off-targets against which they test each and every one of their new drug candidates in the interest of safety. The numbers ranged from a low of 11 to a high of 104 potential off-targets routinely profiled per company, with a median of about 45. Interestingly, the industry’s opinions regarding which potential off-targets to screen vary widely. The total number of potential off-targets screened, across the universe of all 18 pharmas, was 763, yet only 12% of them were screened by more than a third of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, yes, pharma companies do their own off-target screening. But, as we’ve discussed, this is a far cry from the universe of druggable receptors, and is only concentrated on their particular assets, not other ones. No attempt at creating a universal map!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the same blogpost did reference another big pharma, Novartis, who also open-source a much larger map:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Novartis, who presented data collected “over a multi-year period” profiling drug/target interactions across a median of about 800 drugs per target and 105 gene product targets…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is impressive! One may imagine that if a big pharma was willing to release this, why does an entity like EvE need to exist? For interest's sake, let’s ignore the obvious answer of ‘it is better for everyone if such a dataset is collected using a single, standardized protocol instead of compiled from unrelated experiments over years.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked Bill exactly this question, and the answer was a two-parter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one, the dataset that was collected by Novartis, and indeed every large-scale dataset that will ever be collected by big pharma, will always be limited by the constraint we mentioned at the start: everybody only cares about the drug working. A logical conclusion of this is that nearly every receptor covered in these sorts of screens is a safety-oriented receptor. Cytochrome P450, hERG, serotonin subtypes, dopamine D₂, and the like. These are important receptors, not because of how mechanistically interesting they are, but because they are dangerous. Indeed, the vast majority of screened receptors lie within the so-called Bowes-44 set, which comes from a 2012 paper that identified 44 receptors known to be often implicated in safety-related drug failures. Though these do include NR’s and GPCR’s, it is a minimal set of them, as, again, the screening is not meant to assess how mechanistically interesting the receptors are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if a big pharma does decide to explore beyond the realm of safety-oriented receptors, they will almost certainly keep that dataset to themselves. Why release potential alpha to competitors? Hence, why nothing quite like EvE has come out in the past and it is unlikely it ever will in the future, at least from a for-profit entity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And two, EvE eventually hopes to cover a lot more ground than any of the publicly available datasets. Currently, yes, the Novartis dataset is larger than EvE’s, but it won’t be for long. In fact, their plans for the upcoming few years ended up being so interesting that I decided to split it off into another section:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What does the future look like?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EvE is still quite young, just over 2 years old, and I think the future of it is going to look really, really crazy. At the end of my startup coverage articles, I typically focus on commercial/scientific risks. But given that EvE is assured funding on a multi-year horizon without needing to care about market demands, it may be much more instructive (and interesting!) to instead discuss their upcoming plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier I noted that EvE has currently released data for 29 NRs and 56 GPCRs, out of a planned 40 NR’s and 200 GPCR’s. In my conversation with Bill, I asked him how much time is left till the remaining ones are released. I expected the answer to be, optimistically, ‘over the next few years’, given how EvE only started to release data back in November 2024 and that the Novartis dataset collection process also took several years. I was astonished to learn that he expected to have released the remainder of all GPCR + NR screens dataset by the end of this year. Setting up the assays, validation, and automation was the hard part, which is why their data releases have only started recently. But now that that’s all set up, they simply must turn the crank to get the rest out of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s next? Bill told me that the next target of receptors are kinases, 500~ or so receptors that have been increasingly valuable drug targets over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then what? Bill said he’s open to exploring even more drug targets, but he also said, surprisingly, that EvE may add more chemicals on top of the 1,600~ planned FDA-approved drugs. The FDA-approved drugs, he said, are success stories. Potentially it’d be even more interesting to consider the failures as well. Especially the ones that everybody expected to work, arrived at phase 3, and set billions of dollars on fire after the trial results came out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even more exotic options are also on the table. For example, Bill discussed exploring how metabolites of approved drugs interact with targets. Some context: most secondary pharmacology work stops at the parent compound, but metabolic byproducts of a drug can have entirely different binding profiles, and, in some cases, they’re the ones responsible for efficacy (e.g codeine, which metabolizes into the much more effective morphine) or for toxicity (e.g. acetaminophen, which metabolizes into the very toxic NAPQI). He also mentioned potentially using EvE’s assaying work to develop our understanding of tool compounds, which are chemicals that don’t necessarily have therapeutic value themselves, but are used in research to probe specific biological pathways or validate target function. An ACS page has this to say about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While tool compounds have tremendous potential for advancing life science research, they are broadly defined, and it is often difficult for a researcher to determine the best tool compounds to employ during the research process. There remains a great need for more tool compound databases and authoritative sources of information from experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, as always, there is a (very short) Derek Lowe piece on how a commonly-relied upon tool compound moonlights as a ligand for a structurally unrelated receptor, likely muddying the literature the tiniest bit. More work here would almost certainly be deeply appreciated by those in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, EvE really exemplifies the thesis I put forward in a past essay about how smart people in biology should do more boring things. Very little that is directly sexy about doing an N x M screen, but the impact of doing something like it well can be immense. And I have little doubt that EvE Bio has been doing it well, and will continue to do so in their future projects. If you’re interested in checking out their dataset, check it out here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless the owner of a still-existing patent is looking to expand indications!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Bill’s words: (1) about half of all GPCRs are sensory receptors (taste/smell), generally regarded as not likely involved in many (or even any) diseases, and anyway smell receptors are hard to work with in HTS because their ligands are compounds with very high vapor pressures (basically, gasses); and (2) only about 170 of the remainder are validated drug targets, and only about 200 (including those 170) have compounds (either drugs or research chemicals) which are known to turn on the receptor (AKA, an agonist). It's pretty nearly impossible to design a meaningful assay for receptor activity if you don't have a positive control compound.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nearly 90% of Windows Games now run on Linux, latest data shows — as Windows 10 dies, gaming on Linux is more viable than ever&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number continues to grow, but growth seems to be slowing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The viability of Linux as a gaming platform has come on leaps and bounds in recent years due to the sterling work of WINE and Proton developers, among others, and interest in hardware like the Steam Deck. However, the most recent stats from ProtonDB (via Boiling Steam) highlight that we are edging towards a magnificent milestone. The latest distilled data shows that almost 90% of Windows games now run on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having nine in ten Windows games accessible in a new Linux install is quite an achievement. The milestone comes as we see computer users flocking to other platforms during the transition from the Windows 10 to 11 eras. Of course, the underlying data isn’t quite so simple as the headline stat. There are different degrees of compatibility gamers must consider when checking if their favorite Windows games work on Linux distros like Mint, Zorin, Bazzite, or even SteamOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Windows Games’ Compatibility on Linux Is at an All-Time High: https://t.co/G06smdohrX #linux #linuxgaming #update #gaming #steam #proton #steamplay #wine #compatibility #windows pic.twitter.com/e598JNzqgPOctober 26, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above chart relies on Boiling Steam’s five definitions of playability, but these aren’t a million miles from the Steam Deck ratings Valve dishes out. The main difference seems to be that Boiling Steam doesn’t seem to care whether Steam Deck performance is a gaming-limiting factor. So, in a way, its ratings are perhaps more useful to desktop and laptop PC users who typically have systems that easily outpace a Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boiling Steam platinum (green) rank denotes games that run perfectly, out of the box. Gold (light green) requires just minor tweaks. Silver (yellow) games are playable but have some imperfections. Borked (dark red) games simply refuse to launch. Lastly, Bronze (red) titles exist in the murky water between silver and borked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the chart trends, we see an encouraging growth in the number of new releases that are platinum (green) rated, and a thinning down of the red/dark red zone. Developers will, of course, benefit from more hardware being able to play their games with few if any wrinkles, so there must be an incentive to spend at least a little time checking a new Windows game on Linux, or the Steam Deck specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the flip side, there are some popular titles that don’t look like they will be becoming Linux-friendly anytime soon. The well-known compatibility issues with various anti-cheat technology platforms look set to persist, for now. Moreover, Boiling Steam notes that other devs just seem to be averse to non-Windows gamers. There is quite a bit that can be done with those non-intentionally stubborn games, though. We’d recommend researching community-driven Linux compatibility tips and tweaks for your favorite games.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;ezst036&lt;/header&gt;As a Linux user of some over 20 years and now on my phone.............Reply&lt;lb/&gt;One thing that I think is funny is the shifting naysayers.&lt;lb/&gt;Way back when it used to be "Linux can't be used by anybody its all command line!" (even though 20 years ago there were solid desktops like GNOME and KDE)&lt;lb/&gt;More than 10 years ago it was "Linux can't be installed by anybody, all of the installers are so hard to use and terminal based!" Even though the mainstream was by that time point and click GUI installers.&lt;lb/&gt;Around the time the first Steam Machines appeared, it was "Linux can't be mainstream desktop, it can't play any games nor all of these name name name name name name programs!"&lt;lb/&gt;Now it's "Linux can't play Fortnite! That one program, just that one! Oh noes! Never going anywhere"&lt;lb/&gt;The island just keeps getting smaller, and smaller, and smaller. Linux is now so pervasive on average desktops I'm starting to see the decline of the "security by obscurity" argument and we are on the cusp of Linux desktops having to have antivirus programs. There's enough desktops out there now that the virus scene is starting to diversify.&lt;lb/&gt;And its all starting over with the Linux phones. Linux will never go mainstream on phones! Its all command line! The installers are all hard to use and terminal based! Sigh. The naysayers will never learn&lt;quote&gt;First They Ignore You, Then They Laugh at You, Then They Attack You, Then You Win&lt;/quote&gt;- attributed falsely to Gandhi&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;das_stig&lt;/header&gt;The day when Linux is the default gaming platform may about to be born and those that control the code should simply turn around to game developers and say "Take Your Buggy DRM And Cheat Code And Fork Off!".Reply&lt;lb/&gt;Microsoft should be worried, without gaming, Windows will be a business OS and revenue will tank !&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;ekio&lt;/header&gt;A few years ago I remember the Phoronix article that got us Linux users exited because L4D got ported and we were like wow a real game native on Linux!Reply&lt;lb/&gt;Here we go a few years later and we have thousand of Windows binaries running faster than on Windows itsef. The mesa drivers are getting so good AMD ditched their own private driver and joined the mesa team because radv was superior. Nvidia now helps opensource devs with partial nda doc.&lt;lb/&gt;I think game devs should start thinking about compiling for native linux soon because the trend is going the Linux direction more and more (steam deck is more popular than windows handheld) and if gamers can run 1.5x more fps under Steam OS, there will be a switch someday. Especially when modern DEs are so good. Not even mentioning my little new fav cosmic that is so promising.&lt;lb/&gt;Anyway, this is what happens when freedom and talent are unleashed with limited money vs Microsoft with all the money in the world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;waltc3&lt;/header&gt;Subtract the Windows games running on an emulator under a linux distro, and recalculate...;) IMO, native is better, doesn't matter the OS.Reply&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;luissantos&lt;/header&gt;Replyekio said:Here we go a few years later and we have thousand of Windows binaries running faster than on Windows itsef.&lt;lb/&gt;Really? Because my "independent research" (i.e. prompting ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok) still returns a 5-8% performance penalty on Bazzite / Nobara and 3-5% penalty on CachyOS, arguably the most optimized distros available. This drops to 1-2% on titles running Vulkan, but never outperforms Windows 11 - which is itself 3-5% faster than Windows 10, despite all the clamors of "poor optimization".&lt;lb/&gt;My main concern isn't so much "how many run", but exclusively "how many run without issue" and "which ones are those". If the games I play don't run faster on Linux, may require extra steps to run smoothly, or if some may not run at all, then why would I change to a worse gaming platform?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;header&gt;mitch074&lt;/header&gt;Reply&lt;quote/&gt;So, you asked AI chatbots trained on 3 years old data to give you a 'current' view of things, and you disregard an up to date maintained reports site ?luissantos said:Really?

If the games I play don't run faster on Linux, may require extra steps to run smoothly, or if some may not run at all, then why would I change to a worse gaming platform?&lt;lb/&gt;You do know AI LLMs are NOT to be taken as a definitive source for data, right ?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After kicking off an unpopular pilot test last month, Samsung made the practice of having its expensive smart fridges display ads official this week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ads will be shown on Samsung’s 2024 Family Hub smart fridges. As of this writing, Samsung’s Family Hub fridges have MSRPs ranging from $1,899 to $3,499. The ads will arrive through a software update that Samsung will start issuing this month and display on the fridge’s integrated 21.5- or 32-inch (depending on the model) screen. The ads will show when the fridges are idle and display what Samsung calls Cover Screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As part of the Family Hub software update, we are piloting a new widget for select Cover Screens themes of Family Hub refrigerators. The widget will display useful day-to-day information such as news, calendar and weather forecasts, along with curated advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Samsung also said that its fridges will only show contextualized ads, instead of personalized ads, which rely on collecting data on users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Verge reported that the widget will appear as a rectangular box at the bottom of the screens. The box will change what it displays “every 10 seconds,” the publication said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software update will also introduce “a Daily Board theme that offers a new way to see useful information at a glance,” Samsung said. The Verge reported that this feature will also include ads, something that Samsung’s announcement neglected to state. The Daily Board theme will show five tiles with information such as appointments and the weather, and one with ads.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: why do some towers blink?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Well red lighting is a thing. It's in the regulations, it specifies red lighting or white lighting, and one of the things like the red lights can be a bulb like this inside of a red housing, could be LED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Giant Bulbs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: Where'd you find this bulb? This was not in my studio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: This bulb is a spare bulb for a tower site. And most of us use the same bulb, same socket, 620 watts. It's a very standard broadcast bulb for a broadcast tower. And a lot of the beacons, they're pretty tall and they'll have one right-side up, and one upside-down. So they'll have two bulbs in the socket. That way, when one bulb burns out, you realize you have a bulb out, but you're still legal with the second bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: At my house, I don't have any of this kind of bulb anymore [incandescent]. I have, you know, this is a little bit different size, these are LED. Is that similar on towers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yeah. So it is the same. Like an LED assembly for a tower could be kind of flat, and it has, you know, it's set to just do what it needs to do. So in like white light, that's, typically it used to be always strobes. And at KMOX, you remember we had the whole assembly there. and you see the glass bulb, with xenon gas inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So those were the old way for that, but the newer ones are all white LED, and they can be little pancake-looking things compared to what the things are now. They can direct that LED light really to help airplanes and have less trouble for people who live in homes or apartment buildings nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: So if they have a tower like the one that's just north of here that's in a residential area, you're not just flashing everybody constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yes, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Red light, white light?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: You know, thinking about that tower, though, why do different towers have different lighting and different colors and things? And I even remember, like, on the tower that's right by here, there's actually teeny tiny little lights that are, like, on the sides, on the legs of the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yeah, well, tower lighting is in the responsibility of FAA, and they have a detailed plan. The options depend on the heights of the tower, where they are at. The location is obviously important. And sometimes red is a good solution, sometimes white, and sometimes both, red and white solution. And an example is the tower that you're talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: So why would you want both? It seems like that's twice the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: You would have strobe in the day and red at night. And people in their homes at night, a pulsing red light is a lot easier than a big flashing white light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: So sometimes if people are complaining about it, you might go to that solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: You can propose the red at night and the dual lighting works. And then you literally see these two packs and one will be red and one will be white. That's what I've seen mostly, although I heard that they make one now. It's all in one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: [sarcastically] You could have RGB lights—could you do Home Assistant for your tower lighting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: You'd have RGB, but that would not be allowed by the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: We'll actually talk about that a little bit too later, because there are some regulations for how you actually monitor these things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yes, there are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No lights at all?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: But before we get to that, what about the one tower I saw didn't have any lights that were blinking at all. And I zoomed in and I saw that there was a light on top, but it just wasn't doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yeah. Well, and this is about daytime mode. So a tower that's painted, and that's legal for obstruction marking, and you don't have to light during the day. So at night, their lights would come on. So you can be in a situation where, like here, you could see three towers. One might be day and night with white light, and two of them might be red light day only, but one kicks on earlier than the other because of their exact photo cell triggering the lights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: Or if the photo cell is covered by a layer of soot from 40 years...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yeah. So that tower is probably in daytime mode, or it could be an AM tower. An AM tower below 200 feet doesn't have to be lit, so that's another one. In fact, all towers, I guess, under 200 feet, unless you're in a particular area where the FAA would require it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: You always have to refer back to the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: You always refer to the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: But what is the tower site that we went to for the hot dogs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: KHOJ? KHOJ, yeah. Those don't have lights. Those do not have lights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: Because they're under 200 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yes, so they don't need lighting. So, and then they don't need painting either. So that's one of those things that, again, always refer to that because just because you have a tower that's under 200 feet doesn't mean you don't have to make sure it complies or you may have to paint it or you may have to light and paint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tower painting has changed a lot over the years. The older towers have lead in them. So whenever there's a project on the tower, it's not unusual to see the guys in some kind of a, what do they call those?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: A full ghillie suit? Or I don't know what they're called.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yeah. Yeah. So they have that too. So anyway, that's the bottom line from then till now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But some short towers do have lights...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: So far, we've been talking about radio and TV towers, the ones that are really big. But what about little small towers? I know I see a lot of cell towers that don't have any lights at all, but sometimes they do. They just have one little light bulb on top. Or even if they're 50 to 100 feet tall, I've seen it sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yeah, and there's always a reason for seeing a light somewhere, almost always on structures, including buildings and so forth. But if you look around the area where you're seeing that tower that you know is not 200 feet and it's got a light on the top, look you're probably near an airport, a heliport, or somewhere where there's an aviation hazard. You know hospitals, they have their helipads there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So everywhere there is a possible hazard for flight for aircraft is going to have lights involved, and that's why we see a lot of buildings even have lights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAA Rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: So it sounds like we have towers and even buildings that have to have lights put up but who's in charge of all this? Like if I'm going to put up my own tower, who do I need to talk to to make sure that i'm doing it right and get it approved?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: I think we go back to our friends at the FAA. They have that particular circular (AC 70/7460-1M - Obstruction Marking and Lighting). It describes all kinds of of places where lighting is need for air safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that includes our broadcast towers, big chimney stacks, water towers, bridges, nuclear power plant cooling towers, wind turbines, tall electrical towers, you know, those ones that they cross a river, they'll have those extra tall ones with markings in the middle. Sometimes those are required to have lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there are also rules that even apply during construction projects. So you've got these big buildings going up And you'll notice the cranes will have lights on them. And there's a spec for that, how many lights have to be on the crane, what height it has to be at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you look around the next 12 months, look around at all those lights. You'll enjoy it like I do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: You'll look like a radio engineer once you know about these things!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Estimating tower height by light&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: So that's made me think, like, looking through these instructions, I did find this page. And I thought, like, could you use tower lights, the number of them, as a way to judge how tall a tower is? Kind of a rough estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Yes, actually you can because the specifications, like for tall, these would apply to radio and TV towers. They require so many lights depending on the height.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like around here, we would have the F4 version with four lights, four blinking light levels, a light at the top if the antenna here at the top is higher than 40 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you can kind of look and get an idea of whether you're looking at a 500-foot tower or a 1,000-foot tower. I don't think you could go like 700 versus 1,000 as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can tell, and the guys know. I know a couple of pilots that are also engineers or selling in radio business, and they can do that. They'll tell you, you know, like I was passing a tower. What's a tower that's a 1,200-foot tower doing out here? So it's pretty fun, and you go to this document has everything you need if you want to take the time and study that and memorize it and then fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Monitoring and reporting outages (and NOTAMs)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: One other thing that since we've been running this channel I keep getting emails about, if someone sees that there's lights out on a tower, like let's say it's nighttime and you're out there and you notice like one of these towers for the past few days hasn't had a light on, can you do anything about that? What should you do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Well, first of all, if it's required to be lit, every tower that's required to be lit is also required to be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in radio, we put a monitoring circuit on the electrical feed to the filaments and you can measure how much current is going through there, right? So you've got to monitor it. You've got to get alarmed by that. The alarm can call you or reach you. But you also have to call every day, check your circuit, your system, and make sure the lights are on. So if you only are lit at night, that means that call has to happen after it's dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've got to verify that your lighting is working, and you have to report it within 30 minutes. And you find that if a light's out, you've got to report it. And we call that a NOTAM, where the FAA puts it on a system that all the pilots can have access to. And they know that there's a tower there, but it's lights out. And they can use it in their flight planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: You're an engineer and you have the tie-in with the FAA or whatever. But what would I be able to do if I did see a tower that was out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: Well, you can do a NOTAM search. Try to look through and see if you see it. The other thing, you could contact the tower owner or the engineer at the site, the tower's engineer, and they can check into it. They should already know because they have their monitoring equipment, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: They should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe: They should already know. They do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, of course, if you're out there, usually the tower, either on the tower or in the fencing around it or on the building, will have an ASR number, which identifies that tower to the FAA and the FCC, actually. But that number would be the exact tower that you'd be reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff: So hopefully you learned a little bit more about why there are so many flashing lights around at night and not just for radio towers, but for bridges, buildings, and more. What other things do you want to know about towers? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are coming up on five years since the first M1 Macs shipped. It was an incredible time to be a Mac user. Those first Apple silicon Macs looked like the Intel machines they replaced, but they were better in every single way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2020, John Gruber wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We knew this to be true: Computers could run fast and hot, or slow and cool. For laptops in particular, the best you could hope for is a middle ground: fast enough and cool enough. But if you wanted a machine that ran really fast, it wasn’t going to run cool (and wasn’t going to last long on battery), and if you wanted a computer that ran cool (and lasted long on battery), it wasn’t going to be fast.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We knew this to be true because that was the way things were. But now, with the M1 Macs, it’s not. M1 Macs run very fast and do so while remaining very cool and lasting mind-bogglingly long on battery. It was a fundamental trade-off inherent to PC computing, and now we don’t have to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite its Touch Bar, I immediately bought that first M1 MacBook Pro, and when the 14-inch MacBook Pro came out a year later, I moved to it.1 I’m typing these very words on my 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Max inside. Each of these machines was faster than the one before it, outperforming my old iMac Pro and Mac Pro in new ways with every upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple silicon has been nothing but upside for the Mac, and yet some seem bored already. In the days since Apple announced the M5, I’ve seen and heard this sentiment more than I expected:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is just another boring incremental upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That 👏 is 👏 the 👏 point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the PowerPC and Intel days, Macs would sometimes go years between meaningful spec bumps, as Apple waited on its partners to deliver appropriate hardware for various machines. From failing NVIDIA cards in MacBook Pros to 27-inch Intel iMacs that ran so hot the fans were audible at all times, Mac hardware wasn’t always what Apple wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, some of the issues with previous generations of Mac were Apple’s fault — look no further than the butterfly keyboard or the years the Mac Pro spent in the wilderness. Apple will make questionable decisions in the future, just as it has in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference is that with Apple silicon, Apple owns and controls the primary technologies behind the products it makes, as Tim Cook has always wanted. It means that it can ship updates to its SoCs on a regular cadence, making progress in terms of both power and efficiency each time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A predictable update schedule means that incremental updates are inevitable. Revolution then evolution is not a bad thing; it’s okay that not every release is exciting or groundbreaking. It’s how technology has worked for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…but some people have short memories. Before the Apple silicon introduction, we all wanted steady, predictable progress in Mac hardware development. We wanted each product in the lineup to be updated regularly and not wither on the vine for years. For the most part, Apple has delivered. Just look at this chart of the progress Apple has made since the M1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t see anything in those charts to complain about, especially given the frequency at which most people buy new computers. That’s one reason why Apple compared the M5 to the M1 in its press release announcing the new chip. Unless you buy a new computer every year, every update you experience will be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what we wanted when Apple announced the move away from Intel, and calling it boring five years in is missing the point and downplaying the success of Apple silicon thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My review of the M1 Pro 14-inch MacBook Pro remains one of my favorite blog posts I’ve written. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;If you don't tinker, you don't have taste&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;tinÂ·ker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;/ËtiNGkÉr/&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;to make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In Hindsight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growing up, I never stuck to a single thing, be it guitar lessons, art school, martial arts â I tried them all. when it came to programming, though, I never really tinkered. I was always amazed with video games and wondered how they were made but I never pursued that curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My tinkering habits picked up very late, and now I cannot go by without picking up new things in one form or another. Itâs how I learn. I wish I did it sooner. Itâs a major part of my learning process now, and I would never be the &lt;del&gt;programmer&lt;/del&gt; person I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What the hell is tinkering?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever spent hours tweaking the mouse sensitivity in your favorite FPS game?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever installed a Linux distro, spent days configuring window managers, not because you had to, but purely because it gave you satisfaction and made your workflow exactly yours?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever pulled apart your mechanical keyboard, swapped keycaps, tested switches, and lubed stabilizers just for more thock?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have come to understand that there are two kinds of people, those who do things only if it helps them achieve a goal, and those who do things just because. The ideal, of course, is to be a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;when you tinker and throw away, thatâs practice, and practice should inherently be ephemeral, exploratory, and be frequent - @ludwigABAP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My approach to tinkering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of people who still use the VSCode terminal as their default terminal, do not know what vim bindings are, GitHub desktop rather than the cli (at the very least). Iâm not saying these are bad things necessarily, just that this should be the minimum, not the median.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does not mean I spend every waking hour fiddling with my neovim config. In fact, the last meaningful change to my config was 6 months ago. Finding that balance is where most people fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years I have done so many things that in hindsight have made me appreciate programming more but were completely âunnecessaryâ in the strict sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past week I have, for the first time, written a glsl fragment shader, a rust procedural macro, template c++, a swift app, furthered my hatred for windows development (this is not new), and started using the helix editor more (mainly for good defaults + speed). I didnât have to do these things, but I did, for fun! And I know more about these things now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No time spent learning, is time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why taste matters, especially now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acquiring good taste comes through using various things, discarding the ones you donât like and keeping the ones you do. if you never try various things, you will not acquire good taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what I mean by taste here is simply the honed ability to distinguish mediocrity from excellence. This will be highly subjective, and not everyoneâs taste will be the same, but that is the point, you should NOT have the same taste as someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Question the status quo, experiment, break things, do this several times, do this everyday and keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New Release: Tor Browser 15.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tor Browser 15.0 is now available from the Tor Browser download page and distribution directory. This is our first stable release based on Firefox ESR 140, incorporating a year's worth of changes that have been shipped upstream in Firefox. As part of this process, we've also completed our annual ESR transition audit, where we reviewed and addressed around 200 Bugzilla issues for changes in Firefox that may negatively affect the privacy and security of Tor Browser users. Our final reports from this audit are now available in the tor-browser-spec repository on our GitLab instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ongoing development of Tor Browser is made possible thanks to the support of our community. If Tor Browser is important to you, now is a great time to support our mission to FREE THE INTERNET, as all donations will be matched by Power Up Privacy through December 31, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's new?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Desktop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tor Browser 15.0 inherits a multitude of useful new features and usability improvements from Firefox that have passed our audit. For desktop, these include vertical tabs: providing a more manageable, alternative layout with open and pinned tabs stacked in a sidebar rather than across the top of the window. For ease of access, Bookmarks can be retrieved directly from the sidebar when expanded too. However, regardless of whether you prefer horizontal or vertical tabs, everyone benefits from the addition of tab groups: helping you keep on top of the clutter by organizing tabs into collapsible groups that can be given names and color-coded. Tor Browser 15.0 also inherits elements of Firefox's recent address bar refresh, including a new unified search button that allows you to switch search engines on the fly, search bookmarks or tabs, and reference quick actions from the same menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that Tor Browser tabs are still private tabs, and will clear when you close the browser. This enforces a kind of natural tidiness in Tor Browser since each new session starts fresh â however for privacy-conscious power users, project managers, researchers, or anyone else who accumulates tabs frighteningly quickly, we hope these organizational improvements will give you a much needed productivity boost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Android&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Android, screen lock adds an extra layer of security to your browsing sessions. After enabling screen lock in Settings &amp;gt; Tabs, your tabs will lock automatically when you switch away from the browser without closing it. Upon returning to the app, you'll be prompted to unlock your tabs using your fingerprint, face, or pass code, depending on which option your device is configured to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Tor Browser for Desktop, your browsing session will still be cleared when Tor Browser is closed. However, this feature provides peace of mind in a specific scenario: by ensuring that your browsing remains private even if someone has gained temporary access to your unlocked phone with Tor Browser open in the background â whether you've handed it to a friend, or left your device sitting on a table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's changing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Updates to Android and Linux device compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, Firefox 140 and Tor Browser 15.0 support Android 5.0 or later, which was released almost 11 years ago. While Mozilla's commitment to support such an old version of Android is admirable, it introduces several technical and security challenges for developers. As a consequence, Firefox have announced their intention to increase the minimum support requirements to Android 8.0, and have also decided to drop support for x86 CPUs for Android and Linux. Sadly, it's not possible for the Tor Project to maintain support for these platforms on our own without official support from Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While these changes won't impact Tor Browser users immediately, we expect them to take effect with the release of Tor Browser 16.0 mid-next year. This means that Tor Browser 15.0 will be the last major release to support x86 for Linux and Android, in addition to Android 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. However, we will continue to release minor updates with security fixes for these platforms until Tor Browser 16.0's eventual release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although nobody wants to see support for their platform get dropped, it's an important step to maintain the stability and security of both Firefox and Tor Browser over time, and will allow developers to utilize newer technologies in both browsers. In addition, supporting x86 for Android has been particularly challenging for our developers due to the 100MB package size limit imposed by Google Play. While we have deployed several workarounds to stay within this limit in the recent past, these often come at a cost â such as x86 Android users missing out on the Conjure pluggable transport, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Disabling of WebAssembly now managed by NoScript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebAssembly (or Wasm) is a web technology that helps websites and web apps run faster. It allows web developers to write programs in languages like C, C++ or Rust, and compiles these into a special format that web browsers can run more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As has been suggested in this meta-analysis from 2024, further investigation of Wasm's potential exploits is necessary â therefore Wasm is currently disabled in the Safer and Safest security levels in order to reduce Tor Browser's attack surface. Up until now, this was achieved by setting the global preference &lt;code&gt;javascript.options.wasm&lt;/code&gt; to false â however this approach was no longer viable after Mozilla implemented part of their PDF reader in Wasm between versions 128 and 140. Consequently, we have decided to move control of Wasm to NoScript, which is bundled with Tor Browser, and already manages JavaScript and other security features. This means that Wasm now works on privileged browser pages such as the PDF renderer, but NoScript will continue blocking the technology on regular websites at the Safer and Safest security levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users who have manually set &lt;code&gt;javascript.options.wasm&lt;/code&gt; to "false" while in the Standard security level will see their security level represented as "Custom" instead. To mitigate any issues that may arise with the browser's PDF reader, we encourage those users to switch the preference back to "true", thereby passing management of Wasm over to NoScript. Furthermore, manually disabling Wasm at the Standard security level (either via NoScript or &lt;code&gt;javascript.options/wasm&lt;/code&gt;) may also make your fingerprint more unique by deviating from Tor Browser's default configuration. To avoid this scenario, we recommend sticking with one of the pre-defined security levels and caution users against making further changes to individual preferences in about:config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, should you wish to keep Wasm disabled in future, we invite you to increase your security level to Safer or Safest going forward. Note that both Safer and Safest users may notice &lt;code&gt;javascript.options.wasm&lt;/code&gt; switch to "true" automatically as management of Wasm is passed over to and blocked by NoScript, meaning that you are still protected regardless. In addition, Safest users in particular are not vulnerable to any potential vulnerabilities introduced by Wasm since the format requires JavaScript to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Known issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tor Browser 15.0 comes with a number of known issues that can be found in Tor Browser's issue tracker. In particular, we would like to highlight the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Desktop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial release of vertical tabs in Tor Browser includes a couple of quirks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the sidebar is visible (such as when vertical tabs are enabled), the window may visibly resize when Tor Browser is launched.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Due to variations in window size, Letterboxing may be visible. You still get the anti-fingerprinting protections provided by Letterboxing, but the default window size will be different than intended.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are currently working to issue a fix for both of these bugs. Please see tor-browser#44096 for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Android&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web pages may not load after updating Tor Browser on older versions of Android. This can be fixed by clearing your app cache manually in &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Tor Browser &amp;gt; Storage &amp;amp; cache&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get involved&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find a bug or have a suggestion for how we could improve this release, we'd love to hear your feedback. If you would like to contribute to a future release, please see our guide for new contributors to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
