    &lt;p&gt; Canonical &lt;lb/&gt; on 13 November 2025 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Expansion ensures business continuity without forcing major upgrades&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Canonical announced the expansion of the Legacy add-on for Ubuntu Pro, extending total coverage for Ubuntu LTS releases to 15 years. Starting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr), this extension brings the full benefits of Ubuntu Pro – including continuous security patching, compliance tooling and support for your OS – to long-lived production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In highly regulated or hardware-dependent industries, upgrades threaten to disrupt tightly controlled security and compliance. For many organizations, maintaining production systems for more than a decade is complex, but remains a more sensible option than a full upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why, in 2024, we first introduced the Legacy add-on for Ubuntu Pro, starting with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr). The Legacy add-on increased the total maintenance window for Ubuntu LTS releases to 12 years: five years of standard security maintenance, five years of Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM), and two years of additional coverage with the Legacy add-on – with optional support throughout. Due to the positive reception and growing interest in longer lifecycle coverage, we’re excited to now extend the Legacy add-on to 5 years, bringing a 15-year security maintenance and support window to Ubuntu LTS releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A 15-year lifecycle for stability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout this 15-year window, Ubuntu Pro provides continuous security maintenance across the entire Ubuntu base, kernel, and key open source components. Canonical’s security team actively scans, triages, and backports critical, high, and select medium CVEs to all maintained LTS releases, ensuring security without forcing disruptive major upgrades that break compatibility or require re-certification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break/fix support remains an optional add-on. When production issues arise, you can get access to our Support team through this service and troubleshoot with experts who contribute to Ubuntu every day, who’ve seen similar problems before and know how to resolve them quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scope of the Legacy add-on itself is unchanged, but the commitment is longer, giving users additional years to manage transition timelines and maintain compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This updated coverage applies from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onward. With this extension, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is now supported until April 2029, a full 15 years after its debut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By committing to a 15-year lifecycle, Canonical gives users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Realistic timelines for planning and executing major migrations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continuous security and compliance coverage for long-lived systems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexibility to modernize infrastructure strategically rather than reactively&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is complicated, and upgrades carry real costs and risks. This expansion acknowledges those realities and gives you the support duration your deployments actually require.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A simple path to extended coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current Ubuntu Pro subscriptions will continue uninterrupted. No re-enrollment, no reinstallation, no surprise migration projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Legacy add-on is available after the first 10 years of coverage (standard security maintenance plus ESM, and optional break/bug fix support), priced at a 50% premium over standard Ubuntu Pro. This applies whether you’re approaching that milestone with 16.04 LTS or already using the Legacy add-on with 14.04 LTS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To activate coverage beyond ESM, contact Canonical Sales or reach out to your account manager.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We Induced Smells With Ultrasound&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We stimulated the scent-processing brain regions with focused ultrasound. As far as we know, no one seems to have done this kind of stimulation before - even in animals. We reliably produced distinct scents such as a campfire burn or fresh air!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We pointed an ultrasound probe at the scent-processing region of the brain to obtain different sensations. Different focal spots corresponded to different smells, which we’ve replicated first-try on two people and validated with a blind trial. The sensations we obtained are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a video from our blind tasting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smells are processed in the olfactory bulb. We decided to try to stimulate it with focused ultrasound through the skull. As far as we know, no one seems to have done this kind of olfactory stimulation before - even in animals.&lt;lb/&gt; However, after being able to induce sensations of motion the previous week, it seemed promising to try the same for olfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Anatomy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The olfactory bulb, our target, is tucked behind the top of the nose. That turns out to be a pretty inconvenient location for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The nose doesn’t provide a flat surface for mounting a transducer for stimulation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's mostly filled with air, which interferes with ultrasound. Ultrasound needs a continuous medium to travel through, and filling the nose with gel seemed rather unappealing.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we found that you can place the transducer on the forehead and aim the ultrasound downward towards the olfactory bulb. While this isn’t a perfect solution because the frontal sinuses can weaken the signal, careful device positioning above the sinuses still allows us to reach our general target region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The ultrasound&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We got our first effects using just a handheld probe and some gel, but it quickly became obvious that holding a probe steady by hand makes it nearly impossible to keep the focal spot in the same place. To improve stability, we improvised a makeshift headset, allowing for more reliable positioning. We switched from gel to a solid, jello-like pad for stability and general comfort. In the end, our headset got a bit hacky:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It ended up having a knife taped to the probe for mechanical support At the time, all of our headsets had a knife taped to the probe, as untaping the knife lead to software errors.. At some point we thought of using a mouthguard for fixing the probe relative to the brain. This was a great idea considering the teeth are the only exposed part of the skull, except it turns out you can’t talk about smells while wearing a mouthguard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To guide placement, we used an MRI of Lev’s skull to roughly determine where the transducer would point and how the focal region (where ultrasound waves actually concentrate) aligned with the olfactory bulb (the target for stimulation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found our “sweet spot” to be low-frequency ultrasound focused right below the forehead and angled downward toward the bulbs. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;300 kHz frequency (low enough to penetrate the skull well)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Focal depth of about 39 mm (where the ultrasound energy converged beneath the forehead)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;50–55° steering angles (to point the focus down toward the bulbs)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5-cycle pulses at a 1200 Hz repetition rate (short, rapidly repeating bursts)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Albert did not have an MRI available, this general configuration still worked for him with minor adjustments to the focal spot position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Safety&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The largest chunk of the time was spent on making sure the ultrasound sequences behaved safely and in the manner we expected, split between two directions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Measuring the output field. We put the transducer in a water tank and measured the pressure at the focal spot. With our parameters, it ranged from 150 to 250 kPa, which corresponded to a mechanical index of at most 0.4. That implied that the average intensity at the focal spot was by an order of magnitude lower than what's typically used in tFUS and has been proven safe. We were also far within safety limits on mechanical index and thermal dose.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoiding the optic nerve by reducing asymmetry in the system: the nerves are further from the middle of the head. The olfactory bulb also has its two components slightly off-center, so a bit of asymmetry was necessary: we focused at an angle of 2 degrees to the side in one of the presets. However, we stayed within the limit of 15 degrees, which is enough not to touch the optic nerves.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have managed to induce four different sensations, all of them in two people:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We distinguish between a smell and a sensation here because, subjectively, they feel different. The smells are strong and localized to the noise, almost like you could sniff around and find the source. The sensations are more diffuse: a weak, slow-onset impression of a smell, often paired with other (likely placebo) feelings, such as a light tingling on the face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both smells and sensations are strongest on a light in-breath, so we tested by sitting there, with a probe to the forehead, mildly sniffing. Sometimes there is a slight waft of a smell that comes on over a few breaths, and sometimes it just hits you. The first time Albert smelled the garbage, he jerked his eyes open thinking a garbage truck just drove in! This was indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these scents correspond not to specific receptor types but rather combinations of receptors. We think this is because the focal spot is pretty large—300kHz ultrasound in tissue has a wavelength of 5mm, while the adult human olfactory bulb is roughly 6-14mm in length The olfactory bulb can vary in size by up to 3x, depending on "age and olfactory experience", so perhaps (we're making this up) with more usage your olfactory bulb might actually get bigger, leading to better resolution stimulation!.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found different scents by steering the beam over ~14 mm (20 degrees at 4 cm radius). The distance between freshness and burning was ~3.5 mm. We ensured that the effect was not placebo with an auditory mask (blasting music through airpods) so you don’t hear the probe, though you cannot distinguish the different focal spots through sound anyways. We then tested discrimination in a trial where Thomas selected the focal spots, and Lev was naming the scents. You can check out the full video here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is remarkable that we could induce different scents with such little steering (40% of the diffraction-limited focal spot size And potentially even higher, because there was some dead space in between the focal spots, where you don't feel anything.). This suggests that the resolution we have access to is much higher than the spatial resolution of the ultrasound (a kind of super-resolution for neurostim!) In particular, we do not need single-neuron resolution to find an independent basis of scents, upon which we can construct our latent space. To improve this system, the next steps are a more stable setup, increased frequency, more play with focal location, spot size, and stimulus waveform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can you feel the meaning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason stimulating olfactory sensations is interesting is not just "VR for smells", as one might initially assume. The nose has 400 distinct receptor types, and we can distinguish subtle combinations of their activations, so they could serve as a channel of writing directly into the brain, as a means of non-invasive neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The olfactory system potentially allows writing up to 400, if not 800 due to two nostrils, dimensions into the brain. That is comparable to the dimensionality of latent spaces of LLMs, which implies you could reasonably encode the meaning of a paragraph into a 400-dimensional vector. If you had a device which allows for this kind of writing, you could learn to associate the input patterns with their corresponding meanings. After that, you could directly smell the latent space. A bit of ultrasound, a breath in - and you understood a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are able to develop synesthesia - being able to hear colors and see smells, and it might be possible to extend that to semantics. However, at this stage it is speculative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could try to make a similar argument for the eyes: take 400 cones on the retina, hijack them, and you've got yourself a 400-dimensional channel. But we think the nose is better. The olfactory system is much simpler and more directly interfaces with core brain regions, like the hippocampus. The signal through the olfactory system is simply less filtered and processed. If you tried to write arbitrary light intensities into a patch of cones, the next step of the processing would be a convolutional neural network-like structure in the visual cortex, and the signal would get averaged out. The embeddings you'd write would never make it into the higher levels of processing in the brain. You can try to encode the information in a more easily perceptible way, such as Chernoff faces, but it would reduce the bandwidth, and learning the remapping would still be very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, only a few synapses separate the olfactory receptors from the hippocampus This is why certain smells bring up such strong memories!, which is responsible for memory, as well as from the amygdala, which does emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, personally speaking, the authors use their eyes and ears more than their noses during office work Raphael Hotter noted that this is in fact a general statement, as the usage of eyes and ears extends beyond office work.. The nose is an underutilized channel that imposes fewer bad priors (spatial/tonal maps) than the visual, auditory, and somatosensory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found four scents in a couple of days. With a little more engineering, it should be possible to increase the bit rate of olfactory stimulation by a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we gain control of all 400 basis vectors, we might be able to smell meaning.&lt;lb/&gt; And we’ve already covered the first one percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The privacy nightmare of browser fingerprinting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I imagine that most people who take an interest in de-Googling are concerned about privacy. Privacy on the Internet is a somewhat nebulous concept, but one aspect of privacy is surely the prevention of your web browsing behaviour being propagated from one organization to another. I don’t want my medical insurers to know, for example, that I’ve been researching coronary artery disease. And even though my personal safety and liberty probably aren’t at stake, I don’t want to give any support to the global advertising behemoth, by allowing advertisers access to better information about me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while distancing yourself from Google and its services might be a necessary first step in protecting your privacy, it’s far from the last. There’s more to do, and it’s getting harder to do it, because of browser fingerprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we got here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until about five years ago, our main concern surrounding browser privacy was probably the use of third-party tracking cookies. The original intent behind cookies was that they would allow a web browser and a web server to engage in a conversation over a period of time. The HTTP protocol that web servers use is stateless; that is, each interaction between browser and server is expected to be complete in itself. Having the browser and the server exchange a cookie (which could just be a random number) in each interaction allowed the server to associate each browser with an ongoing conversation. This was, and is, a legitimate use of cookies, one that is necessary for almost all interactive web-based services. If the cookie is short-lived, and only applies to a single conversation with a single web server, it’s not a privacy concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, web browsers for a long time lacked the ability to distinguish between privacy-sparing and privacy-breaking uses of cookies. If many different websites issue pages that contain links to the same server – usually some kind of advertising service – then the browser would send cookies to that server, thinking it was being helpful. This behaviour effectively linked web-based services together, allowing them to share information about their users. The process is a bit more complicated than I’m making it out to be, but these third-party cookies were of such concern that, in Europe at least, legislation was enacted to force websites to disclose that they were using them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browsers eventually got better at figuring out which cookies were helpful and which harmful and, for the most part, we don’t need to be too concerned about ‘tracking cookies’ these days. Not only can browsers mitigate their risks, there’s a far more sinister one: browser fingerprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Browser fingerprinting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browser fingerprinting does not depend on cookies. It’s resistant, to some extent, to privacy measures like VPNs. Worst of all, steps that we might take to mitigate the risk of fingerprinting can actually worsen the risk. It’s a privacy nightmare, and it’s getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting works by having the web server extract certain discrete elements of information from the browser, and combining those elements into a numerical identifier. Some of the information supplied by the browser is fundamental and necessary and, although a browser could fake it, such a measure is likely to break the website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, a fingerprinting system knows, just from information that my browser always supplies (and probably has to), that I’m using version 144 of the Firefox browser, on Linux; my preferred language is English, and my time-zone is GMT. That, by itself, isn’t enough information to identify me uniquely, but it’s a step towards doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get more information, the fingerprinter needs to use more sophisticated methods which the browser could, in theory, block. For example, if the browser supports JavaScript – and they nearly all do – then the fingerprinter can figure out what fonts I have installed, what browser extensions I use, perhaps even what my hardware is. Worst of all, perhaps, it can extract a canvas fingerprint. Canvas fingerprinting works by having the browser run code that draws text (perhaps invisibly), and then retrieving the individual pixel data that it drew. This pixel data will differ subtly from one system to another, even drawing the same text, because of subtle differences in the graphics hardware and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It appears that only about one browser in every thousand share the same canvas fingerprint. Again, this alone isn’t enough to identify me, but it’s another significant data point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting can make use of even what appears to be trivial information. If, for example, I resize my browser window, the browser will probably make the next window the same size. It will probably remember my preference from one day to the next. If the fingerprinter knows my preferred browser window size is, say, 1287x892 pixels, that probably narrows down the search for my identify by a factor of a thousand or more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why crude methods to defeat fingerprinting don’t work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might think that a simple way to prevent, or at least hamper, fingerprinting would be simply to disable JavaScript support in the browser. While this does defeat measures like canvas fingerprinting, it generates a significant data point of its own: the fact that JavaScript is disabled. Since almost every web browser in the world now supports JavaScript, turning it off as a measure to protect privacy is like going to the shopping mall wearing a ski mask. Sure, it hides your identify; but nobody’s going to want to serve you in stores. And disabling JavaScript will break many websites, including some pages on this one, because I use it to render math equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less dramatic approaches to fingerprinting resistance have their own problems. For example, a debate has long raged about whether a browser should actually identify itself at all. The fact that I’m running Firefox on Linux probably puts me in a small, easily identified group. Perhaps my browser should instead tell the server I’m running Chrome on Windows? That’s a much larger group, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that the fingerprinters can guess the browser and platform with pretty good accuracy using other methods, whether the browser reports this information or not. If the browser says something different to what the fingerprinter infers, we’re back in ski-mask territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about more subtle methods to spoof the client’s behaviour? Browsers (or plug-ins) can modify the canvas drawing procedures, for example, to spoof the results of canvas fingerprinting. Unfortunately, these methods leave traces of their own, if they aren’t applied subtly. What’s more, if they’re applied rigorously enough to be effective, they can break websites that rely on them for normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, browser fingerprinting is very hard to defeat, and organizations that want to track us have gotten disturbingly good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is there any good news?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not much, frankly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before sinking into despondency, it’s worth bearing in mind that websites that attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of fingerprinting, like amiunique and fingerprint.com do not reflect how fingerprinting works in the real world. They’re operating on comparatively small sets of data and, for the most part, they’re not tracking users over days. Real-world tracking is much harder than these sites make it out to be. That’s not to say it’s too hard but it is, at best, a statistical approach, rather than an exact one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition ‘uniqueness’, in itself, is not a strong measure of traceability. That my browser fingerprint is unique at some point in time is irrelevant if my fingerprint will be different tomorrow, whether it remains unique within the fingerprinter’s database or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, these facts also mean that it’s difficult to assess the effectiveness of our countermeasures: our assessment can only be approximate, because we don’t actually know what real fingerprinters are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another small piece of good news is that browser developers are starting to realize how much of a hazard fingerprinting is, and to integrate more robust countermeasures. We don’t necessarily need to resort to plug-ins and extensions, which are themselves detectable and become part of the fingerprint. At present, Brave and Mullvad seems to be doing the most to resist fingerprinting, albeit in different ways. Librewolf has the same fingerprint resistance as Firefox, but it is turned on by default. Probably anti-fingerprinting methods will improve over time but, of course, the fingerprinters will get better at what they do, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So what can we do?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, and most obviously, if you care about avoiding tracking, you must prevent long-lived cookies hanging around in the browser, and you must use a VPN. Ideally the VPN should rotate its endpoint regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that you’re using a VPN, of course, is something that the fingerprinters will know, and it is does make you stand out. Sophisticated fingerprinters won’t be defeated by a VPN alone. But if you don’t use a VPN, the trackers don’t even need to fingerprint you: your IP number, combined with a few other bits of routine information, will identify you immediately, and with near-certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many browsers can be configured to remove cookies when they seem not to be in use; Librewolf does this by default, and Firefox and Chrome do it in ‘incognito’ mode. The downside, of course, is that long-lived cookies are often used to store authentication status so, if you delete them, you’ll find yourself having to log in every time you look at a site that requires authentication. To mitigate this annoyance, browsers generally allow particular sites to be excluded from their cookie-burning policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, you need to be as unremarkable as possible. Fingerprinting is about uniqueness, so you should use the most popular browser on the most popular operating system on the kind of hardware you can buy from PC World. If you’re running the latest Chrome on the latest Windows 11 on a two-year-old, bog-standard laptop, you’re going to be one of a very large group. Of course Chrome, being a Google product, has its own privacy concerns, so you might be better off using a Chromium-based browser with reduced Google influence, like Brave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should endeavour to keep your computer in as near its stock configuration as possible. Don’t install anything (like fonts) that are reportable by the browser. Don’t install any extensions, and don’t change any settings. Use the same ‘light’ theme as everybody else, and use the browser with a maximized window, and always the same size. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If possible, use a browser that has built-in fingerprint resistance, like Mullvad or Librewolf (or Firefox with these features turned on).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you take all these precautions, you can probably reduce the probability that you can be tracked by you browser fingerprint, over days or weeks, from about 99% to about 50%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;50% is still too high, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The downsides of resisting fingerprinting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you enable fingerprinting resistance in Firefox, or use Librewolf, you’ll immediately encounter oddities. Most obviously, every time you open a new browser window, it will be the same size. Resizing the window may have odd results, as the browser will try to constrain certain screen elements to common size multiples. In addition, you won’t be able to change the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll probably find yourself facing more ‘CAPTCHA’ and similar identity challenges, because your browser will be unknown to the server. Websites don’t do this out of spite: hacking and fraud are rife on the Internet, and the operators of web-based services are rightly paranoid about client behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll likely find that some websites just don’t work properly, in many small ways: wrong colours, misplaced text, that kind of thing. I’ve found these issues to be irritations rather than show-stoppers, but you might discover otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is browser fingerprinting legal?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short answer, I think, is that nobody knows, even within a specific jurisdiction. In the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office takes a dim view of it, and it probably violates the spirit of the GDPR, if not the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GDPR is, for the most part, technologically neutral, although it has specific provisions for cookies, which were a significant concern at the time it was drafted. So far as I know, nobody has yet challenged browser fingerprinting under the GDPR, even though it seems to violate the provisions regarding consent. Since there are legitimate reasons for fingerprinting, such as hacking detection, organizations that do it could perhaps defend against a legal challenge on the basis that fingerprinting is necessary to operate their services safely. In the end, we really need specific, new legislation to address this privacy threat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that many people who take an interest in Internet privacy don’t appreciate how hard it is to resist browser fingerprinting. Taking steps to reduce it leads to inconvenience and, with the present state of technology, even the most intrusive approaches are only partially effective. The data collected by fingerprinting is invisible to the user, and stored somewhere beyond the user’s reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, browser fingerprinting produces only statistical results, and usually can’t be used to track or identify a user with certainty. The data it collects has a relatively short lifespan – days to weeks, not months or years. While it probably can be used for sinister purposes, my main concern is that it supports the intrusive, out-of-control online advertising industry, which has made a wasteland of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s probably only going to be controlled by legislation and, even when that happens, the advertisers will seek new ways to make the Internet even more of a hellscape – they always do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;China reaches energy independence milestone by ‘breeding’ uranium from thorium&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese research institute confirms success of fission-based innovation that is poised to reshape clean, sustainable nuclear power&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The achievement makes the 2 megawatt liquid-fuelled thorium-based molten salt reactor (TMSR) the only operating example of the technology in the world to have successfully loaded and used thorium fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the academy, the experiment has provided initial proof of the technical feasibility of using thorium resources in molten salt reactor systems and represents a major leap forward for the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is the first time in the world that scientists have been able to acquire experimental data on thorium operations from inside a molten salt reactor, according to a report by Science and Technology Daily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The article, published on Saturday, was China’s first official confirmation of its success in the development of TMSR technology, an innovation that is poised to reshape the future of clean sustainable nuclear energy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Li Qingnuan, Communist Party secretary and deputy director at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, told the newspaper that “since achieving first criticality on October 11, 2023, the thorium molten salt reactor has been steadily generating heat through nuclear fission”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've used many content formats over the years, and while I love Markdown, I run into its limitations daily when I work on larger documentation projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this issue, you'll look at Markdown and explore why it might not be the best fit for technical content, and what else might work instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markdown is everywhere. It's human-readable, approachable, and has just enough syntax to make docs look good in GitHub or a static site. That ease of use is why it's become the default choice for developer documentation. I'm using Markdown right now to write this newsletter issue. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Markdown's biggest advantage is its biggest drawback: it doesn't describe the content like other formats can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about how your content gets consumed. Your content isn't just for human readers. Machines use it too. Your content gets indexed by search engines, and parsed by LLMs, and those things parse the well-formed HTML your systems publish. Markdown's basic syntax only emits a small subset of the available semantic tags HTML allows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDE integrations can use your docs, too. And AI agents rely on structure to answer developer questions. If you're only feeding them plain-text Markdown documents to reduce the number of tokens you send, you're not providing as much context as you could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, when you want to reuse your content or syndicate content into another system, you quickly find out that Markdown is more of the lowest common denominator than a source of truth, as not all Markdown flavors are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other options you can use that give you more control. But first, let's look deeper into why you should move away from Markdown for serious work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a developer, you know all about type systems in programming languages. Some languages use Implicit typing, in which the compiler or interpreter infers the data type from the value. These languages give you flexibility, but no guarantees. That's why many developers prefer languages that use explicit typing, where you predefine data types when writing the code. In those languages, the compiler doesn't just build your code; it guarantees specific rules are followed. That's the main reason for the rise of TypeScript over JavaScript: compile-time guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markdown is implicit typing. It lets you write quickly, but without constraints or guarantees. There's no schema. No way to enforce consistency. A heading in one file might be a concept, in another it might be a step, and there's no machine-readable distinction between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complicate things further, there are multiple flavors of Markdown, each with its own features and markup. Here are just a few:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You think you're writing "Markdown," but what works in one tool may not render in another. Some Markdown processors allow footnotes, Others ignore soft line breaks. And some even require different formatting for code blocks. Inconsistency makes Markdown a shaky foundation for anything beyond the most basic document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there's MDX, which people often use to extend Markdown to support things it doesn't:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a typical MDX snippet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Install

&amp;lt;Command&amp;gt;npm install my-library&amp;lt;/Command&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag isn't Markdown at all; it's a React component. Instead of using a code block, the author chose to create a special component to standardize how all commands would display in the documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works beautifully on their site because their publishing system knows what &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; means. But if they try to syndicate this content to another system, it breaks because that system also needs to implement that component. And even if it was supported elsewhere, there's no guarantee that the component is implemented the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDX shows that even in Markdown-centric ecosystems, people instinctively add more expressive markup. They know plain Markdown isn't enough. They're reinventing semantic markup, but in a way that's custom, brittle, and not portable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semantic markup describes what content is, not just how it should look. It's the difference between saying "here's a bullet with some text" and "here's a step in a procedure." To a human, those may look the same on a page. To a machine or to a publishing pipeline, they are entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web developers already went through all this with HTML. Prior to HTML5, you had &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as a logical container. But HTML5 introduced &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and many other elements that described the content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semantic markup matters for two important and related reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;step&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or a paragraph into a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;para&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; without guessing. You can't add context if it wasn't there to begin with, but you can strip out what you don't need when you transform the document, and you can choose how to present each thing in a consistent way. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;step&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is unambiguous. A bullet point might be a step, or a note, or just a list item. The machine has to guess. This is why XML was a preferred mechanism for web services for a long time, and why JSON Schema exists.&lt;p&gt;Let's explore four formats that give you more control over structure than plain Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;reStructuredText is a plain-text markup language from the Python/Docutils ecosystem that supports directives, roles, and structural semantics. It is the foundational format used by Sphinx for generating documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

   npm install my-library

.. note::  
   This library requires Node.JS ≥ 22.

See also :ref:`usage-guide`.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you see a &lt;code&gt;code-block&lt;/code&gt; directive, an admonition (&lt;code&gt;note&lt;/code&gt;), and an explicit cross-reference via &lt;code&gt;:ref:&lt;/code&gt;. You'll find support for images, figures, topics, sidebars, pull quotes, epigraphs, and citations as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of those encode semantics, not just presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AsciiDoc aims to be human-readable but semantically expressive. It has attributes, conditional content, include mechanisms, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of AsciiDoc:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;= Installation
:revnumber: 1.2
:platform: linux
:prev_section: introduction
:next_section: create-project

[source,bash]
----
npm install my-library
----

NOTE: This library requires Node.JS ≥ 22.

See &amp;lt;&amp;lt;usage,Usage Guide&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for examples.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;AsciiDoc has native support for document front-matter. Attributes like &lt;code&gt;:revnumber:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:platform:&lt;/code&gt; let you parameterize content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;usage,Usage Guide&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a cross-reference syntax. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like reStructuredText, AsciiDoc supports admonitions like &lt;code&gt;NOTE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WARNING&lt;/code&gt; so you don't have to build your own custom renderer. It also has support for sidebars, and you can add line highlighting and callouts to your code blocks without additional extensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're writing technical documentation, there's explicit support for marking up UI elements and keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using AsciiDoctor, you can transform AsciiDoc into other formats, including HTML, PDF, ePub, and DocBook, which you'll look at next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DocBook is an XML-based document model explicitly designed for technical publishing. It expresses hierarchical and semantic structure in tags and attributes, enabling industrial-grade transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article id="install-library"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Installation&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;npm install my-library&amp;lt;/command&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;note&amp;gt;This library requires Node.JS &amp;amp;gt;= 22&amp;lt;/note&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xref linkend="usage-chapter"&amp;gt;Usage Guide&amp;lt;/xref&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every tag is meaningful: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;para&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;note&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xref&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You'll find predefined tags for function names, variables, application names, keyboard shortcuts, UI elements, and much more. Being able to mark up the specific product names and terminology you use makes it so much easier to create glossaries and indexes. And Docbook has tags for defining index terms, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DocBook's rich ecosystem of XSLT stylesheets supports transforming to HTML, PDF, man pages, and even Markdown. Using DocBook ensures structure and validation at scale, as long as you use the tags it provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's DITA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DITA is a standard for writing, managing, and publishing content. It's a topic-based XML architecture with built-in reuse, specialization, and modular content design. It's an open standard, and it's widely used in enterprises for multi-channel, structured content that needs standardization and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;task id="install"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Installation&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;steps&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;step&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;npm install my-library&amp;lt;/cmd&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/step&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/steps&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;prolog&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;note&amp;gt;This library requires Node.js &amp;amp;gt;= 22&amp;lt;/note&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/prolog&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/task&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;DITA defines types like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;task&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;step&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which cleanly map to procedural structure. You can compose topics, reuse via content references (conrefs), and specialize as your domain evolves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting features DITA provides is the ability to filter content and create multiple versions from a single document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DITA Open Toolkit and many enterprise tools handle rendering, transformation, and reuse pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, XML. The syntax is more verbose than Markdown. Tooling is less ubiquitous than Markdown. Migration requires effort, and your team may resist the learning curve. For small docs, Markdown's features are often enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you're already bolting semantics onto Markdown with MDX or plugins or custom scripts, you're paying that complexity cost anyway, and you don't get the benefits of standardization or portability. You're building a fragile, custom semantic layer instead of adopting one that already works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're writing a quick &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; or a short-lived doc, Markdown is fine. It's fast, approachable, and does the job. If you're building a developer documentation site that needs some structure, reStructuredText or AsciiDoc are better choices. They balance expressiveness with usability. And if you're managing a large doc set that needs syndication, reuse, and multi-channel publishing, DocBook and DITA give you the semantics and tooling to make that process more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to start with the richest format you can manage and export downward. Markdown makes a great output for developers. It's approachable and familiar. But be careful not to lock yourself into it as your source of truth, because you can't add context back as easily as you can strip it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the next issue, here are a couple of things you should try to get some hands-on experience with a different format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for reading. Share this issue with someone who you think would find this helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd love to talk with you about this issue on BlueSky, Mastodon, Twitter, or LinkedIn.

      &lt;item&gt;Beautiful TUI: A responsive, easy-to-use Terminal User Interface built with Bubble Tea.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go (1.21 or later)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Git installed and available in your PATH.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;(Optional) Ollama installed locally if you plan to use the local model.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go install github.com/arpxspace/smartcommit@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clone the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/arpxspace/smartcommit.git cd smartcommit&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Build the binary:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;go build -o smartcommit&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Move to your PATH (optional):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;mv smartcommit /usr/local/bin/&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use &lt;code&gt;smartcommit&lt;/code&gt; as your default &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; command, run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git config --global alias.ci '!smartcommit'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or for this repository only:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git config alias.ci '!smartcommit'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To commit with smartcommit: &lt;code&gt;git ci&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Stage your changes:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;First Run: You'll be asked to choose your AI provider (OpenAI or Ollama) and configure it.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Analysis: The AI will analyze your changes.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Questions: Answer a few questions to provide context.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Review: The AI generates a commit message. You can edit it or confirm it to commit immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you already know what you want to write, you can select "I already know what to write" from the main menu to open your default git editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;smartcommit stores its configuration in a local file (usually &lt;code&gt;~/.smartcommit/config.json&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;OPENAI_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;: If set, smartcommit can detect this during setup and ask if you want to use it, saving you from pasting it manually.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A documented case of infrastructure failure, failed escalation, and a company that refuses to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here’s the situation: I have outages. My neighbor has the same outages. Xfinity won’t fix it.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought Xfinity internet in June 2024. Immediately, my connection started dropping. Multiple times a day. Every single day. After troubleshooting every piece of equipment I had and questioning my sanity my neighbor complained about the same thing which led me to understand this was not my equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I set up an uptime monitor and found that these outages happen 6-7 times per day for 125 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 17 months of my service term that’s approximately 3,387 outage incidents totaling 117+ hours of cumulative downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This outage pattern has recurred thousands of times. It is consistent, predictable, and it follows an automated schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My neighbor has the same problem. Different house. Different line from a different junction box. Same 125-second outages happening at the same times of day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="mai-accordion-summary"&gt;PING Uptime Log&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Attempts to Fix It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I called support. Multiple times. They blamed my WiFi (I’m hardwired). They blamed my modem (an Xfinity Approved MB8611 that worked without fault on Wave Broadband and Spectrum). They blamed my router (I tested with multiple devices). They sent a subcontracted technician. Then another subcontracted technician. Then a subcontracted crew. The crew ran a new coax line and grounded it to a water pipe that turns into PVC when it enters the ground (this doesn’t ground anything). Then they sent an Xfinity technician to look at the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem never changed. The only thing that changed is my download speed dropped from advertised 1200Mbps to &amp;lt;500Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I escalated to retention. They offered me nothing. I provided detailed technical documentation showing the exact pattern of the outages, the minute markers they occur at, the exact duration every single time. They didn’t understand it. They couldn’t escalate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was transferred to technical support. The person did not care and put me on speaker phone with so much background noise I couldn’t hear myself think. I imagine he was rolling his eyes while trying his utmost to care less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Neighbor’s Attempts to Fix It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He called Xfinity about his TV cutting out repeatedly. The technician told him his UPS grounding his coax cable was causing the problem. So he ungrounded the cable, pocketed the spare cable, and my neighbor kept having the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I Found&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just in the last 72 hours I have documented 20 consecutive outages using OPNSense’s built in gateway uptime monitor. Here’s what they show:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every single outage lasted 124.8 ± 1.3 seconds. That’s not random hardware failure. That’s a timeout value hardcoded into something in Xfinity’s infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outages cluster at specific minute markers. 35% start at minute :44. 35% start at minute :29. This is scheduled automation. This is likely a cron job or automated task running at those exact times every hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outages peak at specific hours. Most happen between noon and 1 PM. Others cluster in early morning around 2-3 AM. This is not random.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an infrastructure problem on Xfinity’s network. Not on my end. Not on my neighbor’s end. Upstream. Somewhere on their equipment something is failing for exactly 125 seconds multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have the data. I have the patterns. I have another customer (my neighbor) on a different line experiencing the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xfinity has all this information. They know about the problem. They just won’t investigate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why They Won’t Fix It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support can’t understand technical data. They follow scripts. When I attempted to explain monitoring logs they had no framework for discussing it. They blamed my equipment because that’s what they’re trained to do.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nobody has authority to escalate. Retention transferred me to tech support. Tech support couldn’t care nor help. They dug up my yard and placed a new line which did nothing to solve the problem. Nobody would actually order an investigation into the upstream infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There’s no pressure to fix it. Xfinity is the only gigabit provider in this area. No competition. No alternatives. I can’t leave. So they don’t have to care.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A 2-minute outage every few hours is “tolerable.” It’s annoying enough to frustrate customers but not enough to make them quit (since they have nowhere else to go). It’s cheap to ignore compared to actually investigating and fixing it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s Also a Security Problem&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About half of the Xfinity junction boxes in my neighborhood are unlocked or broken. Anyone can walk up and disconnect whomever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your home security system is on Xfinity with no wireless backup, someone can just walk to the street and physically disconnect your internet, rob your house, and your security system won’t notify you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I’m Out of Options&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve done everything I can do as a customer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Documented the problem professionally&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Escalated through all available channels&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Provided technical evidence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Been ignored at every level&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is real. My neighbor confirms it. Everyone downstream of whatever is broken on their infrastructure probably has it too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t fix this. Only Xfinity can. And they won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I’m publishing this hoping someone with actual authority, perhaps someone at a regulatory agency, someone at a news outlet, someone who has power over Xfinity sees this and decides to actually investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I’m out of options. My neighbors are out of options. And Xfinity’s counting on us staying out of options. Because this is the reality of my neighborhood (source):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re in Sacramento County and have Xfinity internet, check two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Walk to your junction box. Is it locked? If not, you have a physical security problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Look at where your cable grounds. Does it go to your electrical panel? Or to a water pipe? If it’s a water pipe or PVC, that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Have you noticed your connection drop briefly multiple times a day? Same times of day? If you see a pattern, document it. You might have the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to report this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nov 22 (Reuters) - Meta shut down internal research into the mental health effects of Facebook and Instagram after finding causal evidence that its products harmed users’ mental health, according to unredacted filings in a class action by U.S. school districts against Meta and other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a 2020 research project code-named “Project Mercury,” Meta (META.O) scientists worked with survey firm Nielsen to gauge the effect of “deactivating” Facebook and Instagram, according to Meta documents obtained via discovery. To the company’s disappointment, “people who stopped using Facebook for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness and social comparison,” internal documents said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than publishing those findings or pursuing additional research, the filing states, Meta called off further work and internally declared that the negative study findings were tainted by the “existing media narrative” around the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privately, however, staff assured Nick Clegg, Meta’s then-head of global public policy, that the conclusions of the research were valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Nielsen study does show causal impact on social comparison,” (unhappy face emoji), an unnamed staff researcher allegedly wrote. Another staffer worried that keeping quiet about negative findings would be akin to the tobacco industry “doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite Meta’s own work documenting a causal link between its products and negative mental health effects, the filing alleges, Meta told Congress that it had no ability to quantify whether its products were harmful to teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement Saturday, Meta spokesman Andy Stone said the study was stopped because its methodology was flawed and that it worked diligently to improve the safety of its products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE PRODUCT RISKS WERE HIDDEN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allegation of Meta burying evidence of social media harms is just one of many in a late Friday filing by Motley Rice, a law firm suing Meta, Google (GOOGL.O), TikTok and Snapchat (SNAP.N) on behalf of school districts around the country. Broadly, the plaintiffs argue the companies have intentionally hidden the internally recognized risks of their products from users, parents and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok, Google and Snapchat did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allegations against Meta and its rivals include tacitly encouraging children below the age of 13 to use their platforms, failing to address child sexual abuse content and seeking to expand the use of social media products by teenagers while they were at school. The plaintiffs also allege that the platforms attempted to pay child-focused organizations to defend the safety of their products in public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one instance, TikTok sponsored the National PTA and then internally boasted about its ability to influence the child-focused organization. Per the filing, TikTok officials said the PTA would “do whatever we want going forward in the fall… (t)hey’ll announce things publicly(,), (t)heir CEO will do press statements for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By and large, however, the allegations against the other social media platforms are less detailed than those against Meta. The internal documents cited by the plaintiffs allege:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta intentionally designed its youth safety features to be ineffective and rarely used, and blocked testing of safety features that it feared might be harmful to growth.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta required users to be caught 17 times attempting to traffic people for sex before it would remove them from its platform, which a document described as “a very, very, very high strike threshold."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta recognized that optimizing its products to increase teen engagement resulted in serving them more harmful content, but did so anyway.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta stalled internal efforts to prevent child predators from contacting minors for years due to growth concerns, and pressured safety staff to circulate arguments justifying its decision not to act.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a text message in 2021, Mark Zuckerberg said that he wouldn’t say that child safety was his top concern “when I have a number of other areas I’m more focused on like building the metaverse.” Zuckerberg also shot down or ignored requests by Clegg to better fund child safety work.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta’s Stone disputed these allegations, saying the company’s teen safety measures are effective and that the company’s current policy is to remove accounts as soon as they are flagged for sex trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said the suit misrepresents its efforts to build safety features for teens and parents, and called its safety work “broadly effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions,” Stone said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The underlying Meta documents cited in the filing are not public, and Meta has filed a motion to strike the documents. Stone said the objection was to the over-broad nature of what plaintiffs are seeking to unseal, not unsealing in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re introducing the proposal for the MCP Apps Extension (SEP-1865) to standardize support for interactive user interfaces in the Model Context Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This extension addresses one of the most requested features from the MCP community and builds on proven work from MCP-UI and OpenAI Apps SDK - the ability for MCP servers to deliver interactive user interfaces to hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MCP Apps Extension introduces a standardized pattern for declaring UI resources, linking them to tools, and enabling bidirectional communication between embedded interfaces and the host application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SEP was authored by MCP Core Maintainers at OpenAI and Anthropic, together with the MCP-UI creators and lead maintainers of the MCP UI Community Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Standardization for interactive interfaces&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, MCP servers are limited to exchanging text and structured data with hosts. While this works well for many use cases, it creates friction when tools need to present visual information or gather complex user input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, consider a data visualization MCP server that returns chart data as JSON. The host application must interpret that data and render it. Handling all kinds of specialized data in this scenario translates to a significant burden for client developers, who would need to build their own logic to render the UI. As more UI requirements come up, like the need to collect multiple related settings from users, the complexity balloons. Alternatively, without UI support, these interactions become awkward exchanges of text prompts and responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MCP community has been creative in working around these limitations, but different implementations using varying conventions and architectures make it harder for servers to work consistently across clients. This lack of standardization creates a real risk of ecosystem fragmentation - something we’re working to proactively prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MCP-UI project, created by Ido Salomon and Liad Yosef and maintained by a dedicated community, spearheaded the vision of agentic apps with interactive interfaces. The project developed patterns for delivering rich user interfaces as first-class MCP resources, proving that agentic apps fit naturally within the MCP architecture. The project is backed by a large community and provides rich SDKs, adopted at leading companies and projects such as Postman, Shopify, Hugging Face, Goose, and ElevenLabs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenAI Apps SDK further validated the demand for rich UI experiences within conversational AI interfaces. The SDK enables developers to build rich, interactive applications inside ChatGPT using MCP as its backbone. To ensure interoperability and establish consistent security and usage patterns across the ecosystem, Anthropic, OpenAI, and MCP-UI are collaborating to create an official MCP extension for interactive interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MCP Apps Extension specification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re proposing a specification for UI resources in MCP, but the implications go further than just a set of schema changes. The MCP Apps Extension is starting to look like an agentic app runtime: a foundation for novel interactions between AI models, users, and applications. The proposal is intentionally lean, starting with core patterns that we plan on expanding over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Key design decisions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Pre-declared resources&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UI templates are resources with the &lt;code&gt;ui://&lt;/code&gt; URI scheme, referenced in tool metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Server registers UI resource
{
  uri: "ui://charts/bar-chart",
  name: "Bar Chart Viewer",
  mimeType: "text/html+mcp"
}

// Tool references it in metadata
{
  name: "visualize_data_as_bar_chart",
  description: "Plots some data as a bar chart",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      series: { type: "array", items: .... }
    }
  },
  _meta: {
    "ui/resourceUri": "ui://charts/bar-chart",
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach enables hosts to prefetch and review templates before tool execution, improving both performance and security. It also separates static presentation (the template) from dynamic data (tool results), enabling better caching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;MCP transport for communication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of inventing a custom message protocol, UI components communicate with hosts using existing MCP JSON-RPC base protocol over &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt;. This means that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UI developers can use the standard &lt;code&gt;@modelcontextprotocol/sdk&lt;/code&gt;to build their applications&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All communication is structured and auditable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Future MCP features automatically work with the UI extension&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Starting with HTML&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial extension specification supports only &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; content, rendered in sandboxed iframes. This provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Universal browser support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Well-understood security model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Screenshot and preview generation capabilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A clear baseline for future extensions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other content types such as external URLs, remote DOM, and native widgets are explicitly deferred to future iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Security-first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hosting interactive content from MCP servers requires careful security consideration. The proposal addresses this through multiple layers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iframe sandboxing: All UI content runs in sandboxed iframes with restricted permissions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Predeclared templates: Hosts can review HTML content before rendering&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auditable messages: All UI-to-host communication goes through loggable JSON-RPC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User consent: Hosts can require explicit approval for UI-initiated tool calls&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These mitigations create defense in depth against malicious servers while preserving the flexibility developers need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Backward compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MCP Apps is an optional extension. Existing implementations continue working without changes, and hosts can gradually adopt UI support at their own pace. Servers should provide text-only fallback for all UI-enabled tools and return meaningful content even when UI is unavailable, so they can serve both UI-capable and text-only hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UI Community Working Group has been instrumental in shaping this proposal through extensive feedback and discussion. We have built an early access SDK to demonstrate the patterns and types described in the specification proposal. The MCP-UI client and server SDKs support these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in contributing to this effort, we invite you to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review the full specification in SEP-1865&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Test prototype implementations and share your experience&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal wouldn’t exist without the work of the maintainers at MCP-UI, OpenAI, and Anthropic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ido Salomon and Liad Yosef, through MCP-UI and moderation of &lt;code&gt;#ui-wg&lt;/code&gt;, incubated and championed many of the patterns that MCP Apps now standardizes, and together with contributors demonstrated that UI resources can be a natural part of MCP.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been studying the standard cell circuitry in the Intel 386 processor recently. The 386, introduced in 1985, was Intel's most complex processor at the time, containing 285,000 transistors. Intel's existing design techniques couldn't handle this complexity and the chip began to fall behind schedule. To meet the schedule, the 386 team started using a technique called standard cell logic. Instead of laying out each transistor manually, the layout process was performed by a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea behind standard cell logic is to create standardized circuits (standard cells) for each type of logic element, such as an inverter, NAND gate, or latch. You feed your circuit description into software that selects the necessary cells, positions these cells into columns, and then routes the wiring between the cells. This "automatic place and route" process creates the chip layout much faster than manual layout. However, switching to standard cells was a risky decision since if the software couldn't create a dense enough layout, the chip couldn't be manufactured. But in the end, the 386 finished ahead of schedule, an almost unheard-of accomplishment.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 386's standard cell circuitry contains a few circuits that I didn't expect. In this blog post, I'll take a quick look at some of these circuits: surprisingly large multiplexers, a transistor that doesn't fit into the standard cell layout, and inverters that turned out not to be inverters. (If you want more background on standard cells in the 386, see my earlier post, "Reverse engineering standard cell logic in the Intel 386 processor".)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The photo below shows the 386 die with the automatic-place-and-route regions highlighted; I'm focusing on the red region in the lower right. These blocks of logic have cells arranged in rows, giving them a characteristic striped appearance. The dark stripes are the transistors that make up the logic gates, while the lighter regions between the stripes are the "routing channels" that hold the wiring that connects the cells. In comparison, functional blocks such as the datapath on the left and the microcode ROM in the lower right were designed manually to optimize density and performance, giving them a more solid appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for other features on the chip, the black circles around the border are bond wire connections that go to the chip's external pins. The chip has two metal layers, a small number by modern standards, but a jump from the single metal layer of earlier processors such as the 286. (Providing two layers of metal made automated routing practical: one layer can hold horizontal wires while the other layer can hold vertical wires.) The metal appears white in larger areas, but purplish where circuitry underneath roughens its surface. The underlying silicon and the polysilicon wiring are obscured by the metal layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The giant multiplexers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard cell circuitry that I'm examining (red box above) is part of the control logic that selects registers while executing an instruction. You might think that it is easy to select which registers take part in an instruction, but due to the complexity of the x86 architecture, it is more difficult. One problem is that a 32-bit register such as EAX can also be treated as the 16-bit register AX, or two 8-bit registers AH and AL. A second problem is that some instructions include a "direction" bit that switches the source and destination registers. Moreover, sometimes the register is specified by bits in the instruction, but in other cases, the register is specified by the microcode. Due to these factors, selecting the registers for an operation is a complicated process with many cases, using control bits from the instruction, from the microcode, and from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three registers need to be selected for an operation—two source registers and a destination register—and there are about 17 cases that need to be handled. Registers are specified with 7-bit control signals that select one of the 30 registers and control which part of the register is accessed. With three control signals, each 7 bits wide, and about 17 cases for each, you can see that the register control logic is large and complicated. (I wrote more about the 386's registers here.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still reverse engineering the register control logic, so I won't go into details. Instead, I'll discuss how the register control circuit uses multiplexers, implemented with standard cells. A multiplexer is a circuit that combines multiple input signals into a single output by selecting one of the inputs.2 A multiplexer can be implemented with logic gates, for instance, by ANDing each input with the corresponding control line, and then ORing the results together. However, the 386 uses a different approach—CMOS switches—that avoids a large AND/OR gate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The schematic above shows how a CMOS switch is constructed from two MOS transistors. When the two transistors are on, the output is connected to the input, but when the two transistors are off, the output is isolated. An NMOS transistor is turned on when its input is high, but a PMOS transistor is turned on when its input is low. Thus, the switch uses two control inputs, one inverted. The motivation for using two transistors is that an NMOS transistor is better at pulling the output low, while a PMOS transistor is better at pulling the output high, so combining them yields the best performance.3 Unlike a logic gate, the CMOS switch has no amplification, so a signal is weakened as it passes through the switch. As will be seen below, inverters can be used to amplify the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The image below shows how CMOS switches appear under the microscope. This image is very hard to interpret because the two layers of metal on the 386 are packed together densely, but you can see that some wires run horizontally and others run vertically. The bottom layer of metal (called M1) runs vertically in the routing area, as well as providing internal wiring for a cell. The top layer of metal (M2) runs horizontally; unlike M1, the M2 wires can cross a cell. The large circles are vias that connect the M1 and M2 layers, while the small circles are connections between M1 and polysilicon or M1 and silicon. The central third of the image is a column of standard cells with two CMOS switches outlined in green. The cells are bordered by the vertical ground rail and +5V rail that power the cells. The routing areas are on either side of the cells, holding the wiring that connects the cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Removing the metal layers reveals the underlying silicon with a layer of polysilicon wiring on top. The doped silicon regions show up as dark outlines. I've drawn the polysilicon in green; it forms a transistor (brighter green) when it crosses doped silicon. The metal ground and power lines are shown in blue and red, respectively, with other metal wiring in purple. The black dots are vias between layers. Note how metal wiring (purple) and polysilicon wiring (green) are combined to route signals within the cell. Although this standard cell is complicated, the important thing is that it only needs to be designed once. The standard cells for different functions are all designed to have the same width, so the cells can be arranged in columns, snapped together like Lego bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To summarize, this switch circuit allows the input to be connected to the output or disconnected, controlled by the select signal. This switch is more complicated than the earlier schematic because it includes two inverters to amplify the signal. The data input and the two select lines are connected to the polysilicon (green); the cell is designed so these connections can be made on either side. At the top, the input goes through a standard two-transistor inverter. The lower left has two transistors, combining the NMOS half of an inverter with the NMOS half of the switch. A similar circuit on the right combines the PMOS part of an inverter and switch. However, because PMOS transistors are weaker, this part of the circuit is duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A multiplexer is constructed by combining multiple switches, one for each input. Turning on one switch will select the corresponding input. For instance, a four-to-one multiplexer has four switches, so it can select one of the four inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The schematic above shows a hypothetical multiplexer with four inputs. One optimization is that if an input is always 0, the PMOS transistor can be omitted. Likewise, if an input is always 1, the NMOS transistor can be omitted. One set of select lines is activated at a time to select the corresponding input. The pink circuit selects 1, green selects input A, yellow selects input B, and blue selects 0. The multiplexers in the 386 are similar, but have more inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diagram below shows how much circuitry is devoted to multiplexers in this block of standard cells. The green, purple, and red cells correspond to the multiplexers driving the three register control outputs. The yellow cells are inverters that generate the inverted control signals for the CMOS switches. This diagram also shows how the automatic layout of cells results in a layout that appears random.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The misplaced transistor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of standard-cell logic is that standardized cells are arranged in columns. The space between the cells is the "routing channel", holding the wiring that links the cells. The 386 circuitry follows this layout, except for one single transistor, sitting between two columns of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote some software tools to help me analyze the standard cells. Unfortunately, my tools assumed that all the cells were in columns, so this one wayward transistor caused me considerable inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transistor turns out to be a PMOS transistor, pulling a signal high as part of a multiplexer. But why is this transistor out of place? My hypothesis is that the transistor is a bug fix. Regenerating the cell layout was very costly, taking many hours on an IBM mainframe computer. Presumably, someone found that they could just stick the necessary transistor into an unused spot in the routing channel, manually add the necessary wiring, and avoid the delay of regenerating all the cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The fake inverter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest CMOS gate is the inverter, with an NMOS transistor to pull the output low and a PMOS transistor to pull the output high. The standard cell circuitry that I examined contains over a hundred inverters of various sizes. (Performance is improved by using inverters that aren't too small but also aren't larger than necessary for a particular circuit. Thus, the standard cell library includes inverters of multiple sizes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The image below shows a medium-sized standard-cell inverter under the microscope. For this image, I removed the two metal layers with acid to show the underlying polysilicon (bright green) and silicon (gray). The quality of this image is poor—it is difficult to remove the metal without destroying the polysilicon—but the diagram below should clarify the circuit. The inverter has two transistors: a PMOS transistor connected to +5 volts to pull the output high when the input is 0, and an NMOS transistor connected to ground to pull the output low when the input is 1. (The PMOS transistor needs to be larger because PMOS transistors don't function as well as NMOS transistors due to silicon physics.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The polysilicon input line plays a key role: where it crosses the doped silicon, a transistor gate is formed. To make the standard cell more flexible, the input to the inverter can be connected on either the left or the right; in this case, the input is connected on the right and there is no connection on the left. The inverter's output can be taken from the polysilicon on the upper left or the right, but in this case, it is taken from the upper metal layer (not shown). The power, ground, and output lines are in the lower metal layer, which I have represented by the thin red, blue, and yellow lines. The black circles are connections between the metal layer and the underlying silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This inverter appears dozens of times in the circuitry. However, I came across a few inverters that didn't make sense. The problem was that the inverter's output was connected to the output of a multiplexer. Since an inverter is either on or off, its value would clobber the output of the multiplexer.4 This didn't make any sense. I double- and triple-checked the wiring to make sure I hadn't messed up. After more investigation, I found another problem: the input to a "bad" inverter didn't make sense either. The input consisted of two signals shorted together, which doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I realized what was going on. A "bad inverter" has the exact silicon layout of an inverter, but it wasn't an inverter: it was independent NMOS and PMOS transistors with separate inputs. Now it all made sense. With two inputs, the input signals were independent, not shorted together. And since the transistors were controlled separately, the NMOS transistor could pull the output low in some circumstances, the PMOS transistor could pull the output high in other circumstances, or both transistors could be off, allowing the multiplexer's output to be used undisturbed. In other words, the "inverter" was just two more cases for the multiplexer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you compare the "bad inverter" cell below with the previous cell, they look almost the same, but there are subtle differences. First, the gates of the two transistors are connected in the real inverter, but disconnected by a small gap in the transistor pair. I've indicated this gap in the photo above; it is hard to tell if the gap is real or just an imaging artifact, so I didn't spot it. The second difference is that the "fake" inverter has two input connections, one to each transistor, while the inverter has a single input connection. Unfortunately, I assumed that the two connections were just a trick to route the signal across the inverter without requiring an extra wire. In total, this cell was used 32 times as a real inverter and 9 times as independent transistors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard cell logic and automatic place and route have a long history before the 386, back to the early 1970s, so this isn't an Intel invention.5 Nonetheless, the 386 team deserves the credit for deciding to use this technology at a time when it was a risky decision. They needed to develop custom software for their placing and routing needs, so this wasn't a trivial undertaking. This choice paid off and they completed the 386 ahead of schedule. The 386 ended up being a huge success for Intel, moving the x86 architecture to 32 bits and defining the dominant computer architecture for the rest of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're interested in standard cell logic, I also wrote about standard cell logic in an IBM chip. I plan to write more about the 386, so follow me on Mastodon, Bluesky, or RSS for updates. Thanks to Pat Gelsinger and Roxanne Koester for providing helpful papers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more on the 386 and other chips, follow me on Mastodon (@[email protected]), Bluesky (@righto.com), or RSS. (I've given up on Twitter.) If you want to read more about the 386, I've written about the clock pin, prefetch queue, die versions, packaging, and I/O circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes and references&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The decision to use automatic place and route is described on page 13 of the Intel 386 Microprocessor Design and Development Oral History Panel, a very interesting document on the 386 with discussion from some of the people involved in its development. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multiplexers often take a binary control signal to select the desired input. For instance, an 8-to-1 multiplexer selects one of 8 inputs, so a 3-bit control signal can specify the desired input. The 386's multiplexers use a different approach with one control signal per input. One of the 8 control signals is activated to select the desired input. This approach is called a "one-hot encoding" since one control line is activated (hot) at a time. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some chips, such as the MOS Technology 6502 processor, are built with NMOS technology, without PMOS transistors. Multiplexers in the 6502 use a single NMOS transistor, rather than the two transistors in the CMOS switch. However, the performance of the switch is worse. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One very common circuit in the 386 is a latch constructed from an inverter loop and a switch/multiplexer. The inverter's output and the switch's output are connected together. The trick, however, is that the inverter is constructed from special weak transistors. When the switch is disabled, the inverter's weak output is sufficient to drive the loop. But to write a value into the latch, the switch is enabled and its output overpowers the weak inverter.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The point of this is that there are circuits where an inverter and a multiplexer have their outputs connected. However, the inverter must be constructed with special weak transistors, which is not the situation that I'm discussing. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'll provide more history on standard cells in this footnote. RCA patented a bipolar standard cell in 1971, but this was a fixed arrangement of transistors and resistors, more of a gate array than a modern standard cell. Bell Labs researched standard cell layout techniques in the early 1970s, calling them Polycells, including a 1973 paper by Brian Kernighan. By 1979, A Guide to LSI Implementation discussed the standard cell approach and it was described as well-known in this patent application. Even so, Electronics called these design methods "futuristic" in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Standard cells became popular in the mid-1980s as faster computers and improved design software made it practical to produce semi-custom designs that used standard cells. Standard cells made it to the cover of Digital Design in August 1985, and the article inside described numerous vendors and products. Companies like Zymos and VLSI Technology (VTI) focused on standard cells. Traditional companies such as Texas Instruments, NCR, GE/RCA, Fairchild, Harris, ITT, and Thomson introduced lines of standard cell products in the mid-1980s. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google Revisits JPEG XL in Chromium After Earlier Removal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has resumed work on JPEG XL in Chromium, but there is no timeline for Chrome release&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Google removed JPEG XL support from Chrome, stating there wasn’t enough interest at the time. That position has now changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent note to developers, a Chrome team representative confirmed that work has restarted to bring JPEG XL to Chromium and said Google “would ship it in Chrome” once long-term maintenance and the usual launch requirements are met.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team explained that other platforms moved ahead. Safari supports JPEG XL, and Windows 11 users can add native support through an image extension from Microsoft Store. The format is also confirmed for use in PDF documents. There has been continuous demand from developers and users who ask for its return.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Google ships the feature in Chrome, the company wants the integration to be secure and supported over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chrome JPEG XL implementation adds animation support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A developer has submitted new code that reintroduces JPEG XL to Chromium. This version is marked as feature complete. The developer said it also “includes animation support,” which earlier implementations did not offer. The code passes most of Chrome’s automated testing, but it remains under review and is not available to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The featured image is taken from an unlisted developer demo created for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JPEG XL is a newer image format intended as a replacement for traditional JPEG files. It can reduce file size without loss in visual quality. This may help web pages load faster and reduce data usage. More details are available on the official JPEG XL website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google has not provided a timeline for JPEG XL support in Chrome. Users cannot enable the format today, but development has restarted after years without progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;after my dad died, we found the love letters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a few days after dad died, we found the love letters, hidden away among his things. one of them said, i love dota and i love peaches, but i love you more. i will quit smoking and lose weight for you. the happiest days of my life are the ones that start with you across the breakfast table from me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;my parents were not a love match. at 27 and 26, they were embarrassingly old by the standards of their small chinese port town. all four of my grandparents exerted enormous pressure to force them together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;my father fulfilled the familial obligations heaped on his shoulders without complaint. he didn't get along with my mother, or my younger brother, but this wasn't too bad; he often worked away from us (for months and even years on end), mostly in china, more recently in redacted, another canadian city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the physical distance between us for most of my life has made his passing easier for me to come to terms with. i call him dad here but i didn't lose a dad, i lost someone who was abstractly a father to me. he was more often gone than there, had missed all of my graduations and birthday parties. there was one time he took care of me when i was sick. his hands on me were gentle, and he told me stories from chinese history while i lay feverish in bed. i was seven. this is approximately the only memory i have of him being a dad to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;still, the two of us were close in our own way. sometimes, the two of us would go on long walks together. after fifteen minutes of silence, or twenty, something would loosen in him and he would start to tell me about the depths of his sadness and the disappointment in the way his life played out. i was good at not taking this personally. i didn't think he ever had a chance to be happy or authentic, his entire life. he sacrificed himself so i could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i always thought that if he had a chance at happiness, he would be the gentle, funny, and sensitive aesthete that i caught glimpses of sometimes, instead of the bullheaded chinese patriarch others seemed to demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;except it turns out he did have this chance after all. his lover and i ended up meeting soon after his death. edward lived in redacted, the city that my dad had worked in for the past year and a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edward tells me their story, all in a rush. he and my dad had been seeing each other for three years, and had agreed to go exclusive a year and a half ago. they met while he was in china, and there was an instant spark between them, something special and precious that neither of them had felt before. dad convinced him to apply for a university program here in canada, to eventually get permanent residency in canada. so edward, in his 30s, sold his flourishing business and his house, and came to start over in a foreign land for the sake of being with him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edward reckons they were engaged, or something like it; they lived together, toured open houses in redacted every weekend with every intent to buy something together, and there was an understanding that dad would soon come out, divorce my mother, and live in the open with edward for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edward gave me some photos he had of my dad, and i could scarcely believe that they were of the grim, sad man i knew. he beams in all of them, glowing with joy, his smile more incandescent than i've ever seen in my entire life. i steal glances at edward, the person who took all those impossible photos. the person he was looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;my mind keeps stuttering to boskovitch's installation, that single box fan behind plexiglass. i imagine the course of events from edward's point of view: a year living with the love of your life, and then they are suddenly gone in an awful accident and you are too late to see them one last time, to attend the funeral. your own grief is an isolating thing because you are closeted and no one else knew who you were to each other. i wish we had gotten in touch sooner, but edward is grateful to be allowed any affordance, at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;their life in redacted seemed similarly impossible: a life where my dad splurged on the treats he never did at home (hagen dazs ice cream, honeycrisp apples, nice shoes) and left the house on a regular basis to explore the city with the one he loves. a life where he felt safe enough to ask for kisses and cuddles because he knew they would be provided, even to sa jiao playfully. all i ever knew him to do at home was to sit in a stupor by the television set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and there was a new hurt, but it was sweet, to imagine the way life could have been in ten years time, a life i've never previously imagined; dad happily with edward in a nice new house where i'd visit every so often, shoulders loose and smiling, and we'd get to talk, actually talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;according to edward, my dad had known that he had liked men at least since his university years. that makes it almost forty years in the closet, then; just thinking about it makes me feel a sort of dizzying claustrophobia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i came out to mom years before i came out to dad. when i did, mom told me that coming out to dad was not a good idea, because he was such a traditionalist and she didn't know how he would react. but i came out to him anyways, one quiet afternoon when i visited him in china, because i thought our relationship was good and that he can handle it, and i wanted him to know this about me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;when i did, he took it well. he told me that though the path i am on is a painful one, he would be there for me, and that the most important thing was to find xin fu in life, not to live your life in accordance to the expectations of anyone else. in my staggering relief i did not notice the confusion. i just felt so grateful to have had that understanding, a precious gift that i did not have any expectation of receiving. now, i feel only bereft of the conversations we never managed to have, and grief for the life he never got to live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dad lives in my living room these days, in a box made of cherry wood, because mom didn't want him in the house after the truth came out. so when edward visited, he got to see him one last time, and say goodbye. he held the box in his arms and wept, spilling more tears and emotions than his biological family managed to, and i escaped to my room for the evening to give them some privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;did i mention the shrines? we set them up for the dead in our culture. we had ours, a formal thing in a cabinet, and we had knelt in front of it like we were supposed to, given the correct number of kowtows. edward shared with me pictures of his. it sprawled over the entirety of his dining table. it had packs of playing cards from the brand he liked best and his favourite cuts of meat and the wine he finished off the day with. every morning, he would play my dad's favourite songs to him. i didn't know my dad's favourite cuts of meat. i didn't know he drank wine. i didn't know he listened to music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so of course i let them say goodbye to each other. when i went out of my room the next morning, he was still fully dressed on my couch, bedding untouched, staring blankly at the box in his lap. it gleamed red in the morning sun. he rose at my approach, put my dad back on the mantle with gentle hands, and then stood quietly at a perfect parade rest in front of him as i managed breakfast for the two of us. his flight back to redacted was that afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i don't know how to thank you for all this, he says. the chance to say goodbye. he was really proud of you, he spoke about you to me all the time. he never told me that you were gay. edward tells me that dad had plans to go back to redacted in a few weeks time and that he wanted to tell me everything before he left, but he was anxious about how i'd take it. i don't ask edward how many times he'd made the resolution to tell me before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;because you see, my dad was a coward. mom had started asking for divorces by the time i was in my teens, and dad was the one who always said no. he would complain to her mother, a traditionalist, to ensure that she would berate her daughter back into line. his family and his culture had no place for him, so he used her as a shield to make sure that he would be spared the scrutiny. slowly, we found evidence of other affairs, going back decades. of course my mother did not want him in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i sit by my dad sometimes, and i make sure he always has a bowl of fresh fruit. fifty seven years, most of them suffocating and miserable, the last three of them shot through with so much joy his smile absolutely glows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;he wasted his entire life, my mom said to me, the evening we found the love letters. his entire life, and mine as well. &lt;lb/&gt; (dissolution)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46021825</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 08:40:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Signal knows who you're talking to</title><link>https://sanesecurityguy.com/articles/signal-knows-who-youre-talking-to/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="e34c8897a961a0d7"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, at the very least, they can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I got a friend to finally join me on Signal. He asked something about whether or not Signal is truly secure and private, like if it was safe from US government surveillance. I told him: “Well, it’s end-to-end encrypted, so they don’t know what we’re talking about, but they definitely know that we’re talking to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said that because Signal uses our phone numbers as ID’s. So, Signal would know that Phone Number A is talking to Phone Number B, and if they can figure out that Phone Number A belongs to me, and Phone Number B belongs to my buddy (usually not too hard to figure out with some OSINT or the assistance of certain governments), then Signal would know that my buddy and I are talking, even if they don’t know what we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a limit of end-to-end encryption, which I’ve talked about before. End-to-end encryption provides confidentiality of data, but not anonymity or protection from identifying metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I was surprised when my friend got back to me saying that, no, Signal actually doesn’t know who’s talking to who because of this feature called “Sealed Sender“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Woah! Seriously?! Cool!” I thought. But then I started reading how Sealed Sender actually works, according to none other than Signal themselves, and I found that this feature is very technically complex, and totally useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: Woah! Seriously?! Not cool!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;One-way anonymity for two-way communications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Sealed Sender is pretty complicated under the hood, the result of it is one-way anonymity. That means that, when Phone Number A sends a message to Phone Number B, Signal won’t know that the message is coming from Phone Number A and will only know that the message is to be delivered to Phone Number B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does this in a way that’s very similar to snail mail without a return address: the letter inside the mail envelope might tell the recipient who the sender is, but the mail envelope itself tells the post office only who the recipient is so that it can be delivered to them. If the post office doesn’t or can’t open the envelope to read the letter itself, then they don’t know who the sender is. Later on, when the recipient wants to send a reply to the sender, they can do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, okay. This kind of sounds like it’s anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, yes, it sort of is, but only when there’s only one message to be sent. The problem comes up when multiple messages are being sent back-and-forth like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sticking with the snail mail analogy, what happens when two pen pals keep sending mail to each other from their homes without including return addresses in their envelopes? The postal service might not know who exactly is sending each piece of mail but, over time, they would know that Address A in Lower Manhattan, New York, keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 3630 East Tremont Avenue, the Bronx, New York; and Address B in the Bronx keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 350 Canal Street, Lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Oh. Then the postal service would be pretty sure that whoever is living at Address A and Address B are talking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly. That’s the limitation of one-way anonymity: it works only one way! Once you start doing two-way communications, with replies going back-and-forth, then one-way anonymity is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two pieces of metadata&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With multiple messages being sent back-and-forth over time, and with Signal knowing only the recipient phone number of each message, it would be pretty hard for Signal to figure out who’s talking to who when their servers are getting thousands of messages every second from different senders, with each message being conveyed to thousands of different recipients. But, Signal doesn’t know only the recipient phone number of each message; they also know the IP address of each sender. And this is where the snail mail analogy fails, because IP addresses are much more specific than post offices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal messages, as we all know, get sent over the internet, and the internet sends data around using IP addresses. Sealed Sender only protects the sender’s phone number; it does not protect the sender’s IP address. So, if you’re sending Signal messages to your super secret pen pal from your house, and you aren’t using a VPN or Tor, then Signal knows that the messages being sent to your pen pal’s phone number are coming from your house’s IP address (not a post office, your house).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you are using some method of masking your real IP address, you still have to use some IP address in order to communicate on the internet, and Signal will see that the same IP address keeps on sending messages to the same phone number. That’s enough to easily figure out that all of these different messages meant for the recipient are coming from the same sender. Sure, maybe you’re using the IP address of a VPN server or Tor exit node that has other Signal users sending messages at the same time, but that’s extremely unlikely. More likely: Even when you use a VPN or Tor, Signal can easily tell that every Sealed Sender message you’re sending to your pen pal are coming from one person: you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if your pen pal replies, the reply will have his IP address on it (the same IP address Signal sent your messages to) and your phone number on it. And then, when you want to receive the reply, you have to connect to Signal’s servers using, again, your IP address (the same IP address you used to send your messages to your pen pal earlier). Just like that, with two messages, Signal figured out which phone number (yours) is talking to which other phone number (your pen pal’s). If they ever decide to try and figure out who own these two phone numbers, they could ask your telecoms, or simply search Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t avoid using IP addresses on the internet; they are a necessity on the internet. But you can use a VPN or Tor to mask your real IP address with a fake one that’s not tied to your identity. But you can’t do that with phone numbers. A phone number is either tied to your identity or it isn’t; there is no masking possible, unless you use a service like MySudo which isn’t available for most of us (US and Canada only, as of this writing). If you’re fortunate enough to be able to buy a prepaid SIM without ID, then great, all you and your pen pal have to do is buy some SIM cards that aren’t tied to your identities. If buying a prepaid SIM without ID ain’t an option, then your phone number has to be tied to your identity, and Signal can use these unmasked phone numbers, in combination with masked or unmasked IP addresses, to figure out who’s talking to who, despite Sealed Sender’s promises, as long as there’s a two-way conversation going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings up an interesting question: Why does Signal require phone numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Hey, that is an interesting question…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal works over the internet, and the internet requires IP (internet protocol) addresses in order to figure out where a message should go. But sending messages over the internet does not require phone numbers; that’s a requirement when using SMS or cellular calls or mobile data, but not for using the internet. And yet, the “privacy-protecting” Signal app requires you to use a phone number to send and receive messages…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ⚆ᴥ⚆ʔ: Hmmmm…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It’s always a two-way street&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets worse. I keep repeating this: two-way communication. Sealed Sender doesn’t work with two-way communication. But, I’ve kind of been lying. The truth is: Signal already knows which phone numbers have been talking to which, even with Sealed Sender and only one-way communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: What?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do these check marks look familiar to you? (Forgive the pixelation.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, yeah. Aren’t they the check marks that show up for at least a second whenever I send a Signal message? This is what’s shown after the lone check mark, and before they both turn white to indicate that my message was read, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s right. The lone check mark indicates that your Signal message was sent to Signal’s servers, these two check marks above indicate that your Signal message has been delivered to the recipient, and the two white check marks indicate that the recipient has read your Signal message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the thing about the two check marks above is that your Signal app only shows them when your phone has received what’s called a “delivery receipt” from the recipient’s phone. Whenever your pen pal gets a message from you, their Signal app sends a delivery receipt from their phone, through Signal’s servers, to your phone. Their Signal app does this automatically and instantly, and neither of you can turn it off. You can turn off read receipts (the two white check marks) and typing indicators, but you can’t turn off the very first reply: delivery receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The delivery receipt is – ahem – also “protected” using Sealed Sender, but what was it that I’ve been saying this whole time is wrong with Sealed Sender?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: It works only one-way…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ • ᴥ • ʔ: It works only one-way…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ʕ º ᴥ º ʔ: …and the delivery receipt automatically makes it two-way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly. And you can’t turn it off. Go figure why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some alternatives and a work in progress&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you can’t trust Signal, who can you trust? Well, if all you need is a private text-based communication channel that won’t falsely advertise their privacy guarantees to you, Proton Mail and Tutanota (now called Tuta) are pretty good. But if you want private voice-based communication, then that’s gonna’ be a problem. WhatsApp is even worse than Signal, Telegram is even worse than WhatsApp, Wire requires an email address to use it (another unnecessary requirement), and most of the rest can’t be trusted because they aren’t open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could use Jitsi for voice communications, but you’d have to use a separate service for text communications. You could use Matrix for both text and voice, but that’s a software and communication protocol, so you’d have to set up your own server running it. You could use Element, which runs Matrix servers, but you’d have to trust Amazon and Cloudflare with your metadata, making this a rather messy solution to a privacy problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What that leaves us with is a single service that is still a work in progress: SimpleX. It asks for no global identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses. It at least tries, unlike Signal, to make sure that it doesn’t know who’s talking to who. It does this with the use of proxies that you randomly send your messages through to get to your recipient (the technical details of which are too complicated to get into here). Of course it is open-source and end-to-end encrypted, otherwise I wouldn’t be mentioning it. It even goes so far as to allow you to use Tor with it, or any SOCKS proxy. It’s pretty cool, actually; the most technically amazing communications platform I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, it ain’t perfect. It’s kinda’ slow, and messages sometimes don’t come in in the right order or don’t come in at all. Voice calls are… iffy, particularly when using Tor. It is still a young, developing project, though it has been making great strides in improving itself, including getting a security audit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time will tell how it turns out, but at least I can say one thing: we’ve got a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey, Kuma!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deepnote is now open-source! Star us on GitHub ⭐️ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We build tools for explorers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are here to revolutionize how data teams work together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We started Deepnote to help data teams solve the hardest problems. We don’t just need better algorithms, bigger data sets, and more computing power. We need tools that help us explore, collaborate, and share. These tools don’t exist yet. We need to invent them first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data work is as much a scientific and creative process as it is an engineering one. It involves working together, failing, learning, and going back to the drawing board. Data professionals are explorers. To make projects successful, we need tools that are both powerful and easy to use. Tools that help us collaborate and share our work in an engaging way. Tools that make working with data fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re building the new standard in data tooling: a notebook that brings teams together to code, query, visualize, organize, and share — all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are building tools for explorers. Join us.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Build the future with us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re building a collaborative notebook that beautifully integrates analytics and data science into every workflow and decision. But it’s not just about designing, shipping, and selling. It’s about the people who power it — and that means you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get ready to do your best work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transforming how people work with data isn't easy. But we built a culture that allows us to do precisely that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We move with urgency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a small, passionate team revolutionizing how data teams work. We give everyone the tools they need and enable them to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We keep learning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are knowledge-seekers. We invest in continuous learning across every role and encourage a culture of proactive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We take ownership&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are makers. We expect everyone to be a decision-maker — no politics or walls to get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We collaborate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are partners. We work in a fully transparent environment and put open, effective communication above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Backed by the best in the business&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re backed by industry leaders — and they’re as excited about reimagining the future as we are.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Explore open positions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of data professionals already use Deepnote — but we’re only scratching the surface of what’s possible. We’re building out our core team, and we want kind, curious explorers to join and grow with us.&lt;/p&gt;
