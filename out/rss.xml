      &lt;item&gt;Highly customizable layer styling with Mapbox Styles support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connect to any public or private vector tile server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or just use the supplied and optimized OSM2VectorTiles based one&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Work offline and discover local VectorTile/MBTiles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compatible with most Linux and OSX terminals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Highly optimized algorithms for a smooth experience&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;100% pure JavaScript! 😎&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a modern node installation available, just start it with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npx mapscii
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you haven't already got Node.js &amp;gt;= version 10, then go get it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install -g mapscii
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're on OSX, or get an error about file permissions, you may need to do &lt;code&gt;sudo npm install -g mapscii&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any of the supported Linux distros:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo snap install mapscii
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This snap is maintained by @nathanhaines)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is pretty simple too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;If you are good at code review, you will be good at using AI agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using AI agents correctly is a process of reviewing code. If you’re good at reviewing code, you’ll be good at using tools like Claude Code, Codex, or the Copilot coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is that? Large language models are good at producing a lot of code, but they don’t yet have the depth of judgement of a competent software engineer. Left unsupervised, they will spend a lot of time committing to bad design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AI agents and bad design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week I built VicFlora Offline: an offline-friendly PWA that hosts some of the VicFlora data for keying out plants, so you can still use the keys if you’re in the field somewhere with bad internet reception. Codex spent a lot of effort trying to reverse-engineer the VicFlora frontend code for the dichotomous key. It was honestly pretty impressive to watch! But I figured there had to be some easier way to access the raw data, and I was right. This happens over and over again when I use AI coding agents: about once an hour I notice that the agent is doing something that looks suspicious, and when I dig deeper I’m able to set it on the right track and save hours of wasted effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also working on an app that helps me learn things with AI - think of it as an infinite, automatically-adjusting spaced-repetition feed. When I want to do things in parallel (e.g. generating a learning plan in the background), both Codex and Claude Code really want to build a full background job infrastructure: with job entities, result polling, and so on. I like background jobs, but for ordinary short-lived parallel work they are very obviously overkill. Just make a non-blocking request from the frontend! If I weren’t consistently pushing for simplicity, my codebase would be much more complex to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this is why I think pure “vibe coding” hasn’t produced an explosion of useful apps. If you don’t have the technical ability to spot when the LLM is going down the wrong track, you’ll rapidly end up stuck. Trying to make a badly-designed solution work costs time, tokens, and codebase complexity. All of these things cut into the agent’s ability to actually solve the problem. Once two or three of them pile up, the app is no longer tractable for the agent and the whole thing grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Code review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These examples should be familiar to anyone who’s spent enough time working on an engineering team with enthusiastic juniors. Diving right in to an early idea and making it work with sheer effort is a very common mistake. It’s the job of the rest of the team to rein that in. Working with AI agents is like working with enthusiastic juniors who never develop the judgement over time that a real human would1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a good opportunity to talk about what I think is the biggest mistake engineers make in code review: only thinking about the code that was written, not the code that could have been written. I’ve seen even experienced engineers give code reviews that go through the diff with a fine-toothed comb, while spending approximately zero seconds asking if this is even the right place for the code at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my view, the best code review is structural. It brings in context from parts of the codebase that the diff didn’t mention. Ideally, that context makes the diff shorter and more elegant: for instance, instead of building out a new system for operation X, we can reuse a system that already exists. Instead of building a fragile scraping pipeline that pulls dichotomous key IDs from the frontend SPA code, let’s just download the dichotomous keys from this other place where they’re explicitly made available. Instead of building out an entire background job system, let’s just do our parallel work on the client, using all the existing machinery that websites have for doing two things at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a nitpicky code reviewer, I think you will struggle to use AI tooling effectively. You’ll be forever tweaking individual lines of code, asking for a &lt;code&gt;.reduce&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;.map.filter&lt;/code&gt;, bikeshedding function names, and so on. At the same time, you’ll miss the opportunity to guide the AI away from architectural dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you’re a rubber-stamp code reviewer, you’re probably going to put too much trust in the AI tooling. That approach works with competent colleagues, but it doesn’t work well when you’re onboarding junior engineers, and it doesn’t work well when you’re working with AI coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be “good at AI”? Being good at a normal tool like git is straightforward: if you have a grasp of the basic tree-structure of a git repository, and you’re familiar with the majority of git operations, you’re good at git. But the basic structure of AI is an impenetrable mass of model weights, and the “operations” it can perform are “basically anything you can do with a computer”. There are no software engineering tools like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most optimistic AI proponents think that “being good at AI” is about maximally adopting AI tooling in every aspect of your life. The argument here is that AI plays something like the role of Jeff Bezos’ staff. Using a hyper-resourced, hyper-competent staff doesn’t require a lot of skill: you simply ask for what you want, and an enormous amount of other people’s effort will be devoted to providing it. But Bezos certainly uses his staff more effectively than I would, if I were to be teleported into his position today. I wouldn’t even consider asking for half the things I wanted - it just wouldn’t occur to me that I could get a hot Lune croissant waiting for me when I step off my private jet, for instance, even if I really would enjoy it. AI believers think AI tooling is kind of like this. According to them, when you genuinely internalize that you can ask your personal AI assistant to vibe code any program you want, or sort through any amount of data, or draft all of your emails, you will begin using AI much more frequently, to your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think we’re there yet. I use agentic coding tools a lot: GitHub Copilot at and for work, and both Codex and Claude Code for my personal projects2. While they can do a surprising number of tasks on their own, they do require fairly close supervision. The dominant programming model is something like “centaur chess”, where a skilled human is paired with a computer assistant. The better you are at code review - at assessing whether a particular software approach is a sensible one - the better you’ll be at using agentic AI tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I see this point made, I wonder - if you started using AI coding tooling with early Copilot in 2022, and you’re still using cutting-edge AI tooling in 2025, doesn’t it kind of feel like the tooling has grown at the same rate a human would? If you described early Copilot as a brand-new grad and current Claude Code (or whatever) as an engineer with three years of experience, would that be too far off? In another three years, will working with AI tooling be like working with a engineer with six years under their belt?&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Codex and Claude Code doesn’t indicate that I think they’re better than Copilot. In my view, it’s part of my job to use a variety of AI tooling.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PYREX vs pyrex Construction Differences&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning used borosilicate to produce all Pyrex products. However, the company that purchased the cookware products switched to soda-lime glass, adopting the name pyrex (spelled with all lowercase letters).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning continued to make its lab tools with borosilicate, dubbing these products to be PYREX (spelled with all uppercase letters). Borosilicate glassware can sustain the large, sudden temperature changes that frequently occur in labs without shattering. These products are also less likely to react to chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning sold the consumer products or cookware business in 1998. The new owner, known as Borden at the time, later rebranding to World Kitchen in 2000, recognized that the cookware didn't need to be quite as strong, and — to make it accessible to the average customer — it needed to be more affordable. With this in mind, they switched the cookware to soda-lime glass, a less expensive component. Soda-lime glass, now called pyrex, isn't as resistant to thermal shock, but it is durable enough for everyday cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits of PYREX Labware&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;PYREX labware is designed to meet the rigorous demands of scientific experimentation. In fact, these scientific glassware products were integral in developing penicillin during World War II and the polio vaccine during the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corning laboratory glassware products have long been manufactured to meet the quality and reliability standards created by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Corning advanced its quality control for accuracy and precision further by testing its volumetric glassware in an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;PYREX glass is well-suited for lab work because Corning uses borosilicate to produce beakers, flasks, test tubes, and other lab glassware. PYREX lab glassware made with borosilicate can withstand harsh, corrosive chemicals, handle extremely low and high temperatures, and it can survive rapid temperature changes without sustaining damage. PYREX beakers, Erlenmeyer flasks, and round- and flat-bottom boiling flasks can be repeatedly heated up to 230ºC. PYREX volumetric laboratory ware can be brought to 150ºC. Overall, PYREX laboratory glassware has a temperature shock limit — or allowable difference between the temperature of the glass and any medium in contact with the glass (air, liquid, or solid) — of 160ºC.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Always check laboratory glassware for any cracks, scratches, chips, or hazing — these damages can cause the product to break while in use. If properly cleaned and not damaged, PYREX laboratory glassware is reusable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unique Cleaning Procedures for PYREX Lab Glassware&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Despite being made of a strong, durable material, PYREX lab glassware requires specific care and maintenance. Ignoring the specific cleaning differences of PYREX labware can undermine the glassware's integrity and stability. If handled improperly, these products could shatter when exposed to high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Always clean PYREX products with a non-abrasive glassware detergent either by hand or in a dishwasher. Do not exceed temperatures above 110°C during the cleaning process. Do not use abrasive brushes or scrubbing pads that can scratch the glass or its coating. In addition, limit exposure to any aldehydes, ketones, chlorinated solvents, or concentrated acids, because they can damage the glassware.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For over 100 years, Corning has been a trailblazer in creating innovative glassware products that can reliably and repeatedly meet users' needs. These products have accelerated scientific discoveries and enhanced human health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's the limit of what can be in a TXT record?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some places say 255 bytes. They are wrong. Within a TXT record there are multiple character-strings (RFC 1035 section 3.3.14) and those are limited in length (because a single byte is used for their length), however there can be many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual limit is limited by the size of the DNS payload, which for UDP is these days around 1232 bytes. That is obviously quite low. However if we use TCP, which doesn't require anything special, other than the normal fallback to TCP that DNS does, then we can serve up to 64KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I set out to demonstrate exactly that, by using Google Public DNS's JSON API and then serving large TXT responses over TCP, from a custom server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mostly just works, the main issue is not with the length, but with binary data, because JSON isn't really designed to handle binary data. Therefore there is some slightly custom JSON parsing. Using raw binary data in a TXT record avoids the overhead of Base64 or another encoding, meaning more data can be packed in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👉 See it in action. For more read the comments in image.html.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-browser&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible to query this via dig. Although turning it back into binary output is a bit tricky, as the presentation form of DNS responses is escaped for output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can retrieve the data with dig and a little Perl to unescape and combine the character sequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ dig +short dog.log.battery.st TXT | perl -pe'chomp; s/" "//g; s/^"//; s/"$//; s/\\(\d{3})/chr $1/eg; s/\\([\\"])/$1/g' &amp;gt; dog.avif
$ sha256sum dog.avif
7058fbd20ef2af84d5efb0ae7d91f87ce7a912380636c468b32f2c759cbb9130  dog.avif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This is actually just a modified version of the Perl one liner from my Wikipedia over DNS from 2008, nothing changes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the web version uses Google's JSON resolver we know it doesn't have problems querying very large TXT records, however your local recursor may not support this. If it doesn't work you can add &lt;code&gt;@dns.google&lt;/code&gt; to the dig command
line to send the query to Google's Public DNS servers (or any other open
recursor, &lt;code&gt;@9.9.9.9&lt;/code&gt; seems to work too).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought it was a cute hack when I realised it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those interested in security there is a consideration here, attackers have long tunnelled over DNS, but tunnelling large payloads to a browser is potentially something new. Because Google Public DNS has a certificate that includes &lt;code&gt;8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt; and so on, HTTPS
traffic can go directly from a browser without a DNS lookup. This may be
unexpected in environments that use DNS filtering. This is something that will
become more common once Lets Encrypt fully rolls out IP address
certificates,
the difference here is piggybacking on an existing IP address certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This deliberately uses a low TTL (10 seconds) to avoid filling DNS recursor's caches with useless content. It would be possible to increase this and therefore get caching from the recursors, a bit like a free distributed CDN (although I suspect if someone actually did this they would adaptively limit TTLs, if something like that isn't already done).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Server side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The server is a custom Go DNS server. To be honest it was written by ChatGPT because it's not that clever, the idea is what matters. (Although ChatGPT did get some details like truncation wrong so I fixed the code myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the code is here. AI was only used for the server component, this blog post and the client HTML code is my own work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anubis is a compromise. Anubis uses a Proof-of-Work scheme in the vein of Hashcash, a proposed proof-of-work scheme for reducing email spam. The idea is that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass scraper levels it adds up and makes scraping much more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a placeholder solution so that more time can be spent on fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font rendering) so that the challenge proof of work page doesn't need to be presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that Anubis requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like JShelter will disable. Please disable JShelter or other such plugins for this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fri &lt;lb/&gt;19 &lt;lb/&gt;Sep 2025 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a guest post from my friend Łukasz Izdebski Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since my last guest post on Adam’s blog, but I’m back with something short and practical—think of it as an epilogue to this earlier post on Bézier curves in animation. The last post focused on the theory and mathematics behind Bézier curves. What it lacked was a practical perspective—an opportunity to see the implementation in action. I wanted to share with you a simple library that I have created. Its purpose is to directly represent cubic Bézier Curves as Easing Functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The library is designed with C++20 and newer standards in mind, taking advantage of modern language features for clarity and performance. If needed, support for earlier versions of C++ can be added to ensure broader compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EasingCubicBezier&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This class handles the interpolation of parameters used in the keyframe method. The interpolation of parameters follows the same principles as standard Bézier curve evaluation.&lt;code&gt;evaluate&lt;/code&gt; function with a parameter &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, which should lie between x0 (the X coordinate of the first control point, representing the start time of the frame) and x3 (the X coordinate of the fourth control point, representing the end time). &lt;p&gt;As presented in previous blog post, the &lt;code&gt;EasingCubicBezier&lt;/code&gt; character as a easing function depends solely on the X coordinates of the control points.&amp;#13;
The tests were prepared for a single, fixed value of the Y coordinates of the Bézier curve control points (their value does not affect the interpolation performance in any way), and for a set of 256 different variants of the X coordinates of the control points.&amp;#13;
The aim was to cover as wide a range of control point locations as possible (in particular, the two inner points).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance measurements were carried out using the Google Benchmark framework, ensuring reliable and consistent results. Further details and test results are available in the library repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach using &lt;code&gt;EasingCubicBezier&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; has been benchmarked against two commonly used methods in game engines and graphics applications. Both of these alternatives rely on solving cubic polynomial equations, either through algebraic solutions or numerical  techniques.&amp;#13;
In the case of numerical methods, a critical factor is the choice of the initial starting point. This selection plays a major role in determining the algorithm’s convergence speed and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following tests compared 5 different algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt; (because the X coordinates of the curve were previously normalised to the interval &lt;code&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; is the input parameter for which the Bézier curve interpolation is being evaluated.&lt;p&gt;The chart and the table below presents the benchmark results using a box plot,

stability&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;By representing Bézier curves explicitly in just 28 bytes (&lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;) or 56 bytes (&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;) using the proposed method, this approach delivers both speed and stability—making it ideal for real-time animation systems. By storing the curve in this form, runtime execution becomes straightforward: it directly interpolates parameter values without the need to solve cubic polynomial equations.This eliminates the overhead typically associated with solving cubic polynomials during runtime.&amp;#13;
The cost of determining the interpolating function corresponding to a given Bézier curve is deferred to the construction of an EasingCubicBezier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of my journey with easing functions. I am working on another solution, whose main goal will be maximum performance in runtime, while maintaining flexibility comparable to that offered by cubic Bézier curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments | #math #rendering Share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 9 September, Apple introduced its newest lineup, including the iPhone 17 series. Much of the attention went to a new ultrathin model and a bright orange color option (a shade not dissimilar to that of the IEEE Spectrum logo). The new smartphones will also ship with the latest operating system and its “Liquid Glass” software design—but the liquid in these phones goes beyond software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max contain thin, hermetically sealed chambers with a drop of water inside that cycles between liquid and gas to help dissipate heat. Known as vapor chambers, the cooling system is becoming more common in smartphones built for sustained high performance. Some high-end Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel models, among others, have introduced vapor-chamber cooling in the past few years. Now, Apple is following their lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Cooling of smaller portables like phones must focus on spreading heat as widely as possible to the surface of the device, with particular attention to heat-generating components, like the chip,” says Kenneth Goodson, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford who specializes in heat transfer and energy conversion. To cool down those hot spots, the industry seems to be moving toward vapor chambers and other phase-change technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How vapor chambers keep phones cool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard approach to cooling smartphones uses a solid, highly conductive plate made from a material like copper to spread heat. This approach relies on having a surface where heat can spread. Sometimes, fins are added to extend that surface, but this can lead to a thicker device. Most companies, however, are intent on making thinner and thinner phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase-change technology—which has been used in laptops for decades, Goodson notes—achieves the same goal more effectively with fluid that boils and condenses to dissipate heat. These two-phase solutions include vapor chambers, like those used in the new iPhone, as well as narrow, fingerlike structures called heat pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phones have limited volume to work with, and “performance per volume is critical,” says Victor Chiriac, the CEO and cofounder of Global Cooling Technology Group, based in Phoenix. Thin and wide vapor chambers have a high heat-removal capacity and offer an effective solution. The cycle between liquid and vapor is “a powerful mechanism for absorbing heat,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s vapor chamber efficiently spreads heat across the phone’s body.Apple&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Apple’s version, a small amount of deionized water is sealed in the chamber. The water evaporates when near heat sources, then condenses back into a liquid when the heat dissipates into the phone’s surrounding aluminum body. Water is often used in vapor chambers, though sometimes other materials are mixed in to prevent it from freezing and cracking the seal, Chiriac says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vapor-chamber manufacturing faces challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Apple, Samsung, and others push the boundaries of how thin phones can get, manufacturing vapor chambers may become a challenge. While solid materials can easily be shaved down, these chambers need to have enough space for coolant to travel through channels. The chambers have to be perfectly sealed in order to work properly, and “the thinner you make it, the less space you have for that secret sauce to do its thing,” Chiriac says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It comes down to physics: “A big challenge in small devices like phones is that as you scale down the thickness of a vapor chamber, the fluid physics aggressively scale back their performance relative to copper and other solid heat conductors,” Goodson explains. (This is a problem that researchers, including his students, are working to address with new microstructures.) Plus, vapor chambers tend to be expensive to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Apple and other companies have decided to invest in this technology for their most powerful phone models. Goodson suspects part of that decision is to leverage the “wow” factor. But, he says, “with time this approach will likely become an industry standard.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Is Zig's New Writer Unsafe?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sep 20, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we wanted to write a function that takes one of Zig's new &lt;code&gt;*std.Io.Reader&lt;/code&gt; and write it to stdout, we might start with something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;fn output(r: *std.Io.Reader) !void {
    const stdout = std.fs.File.stdout();
    var buffer: [???]u8 = undefined;
    var writer = stdout.writer(&amp;amp;buffer);
    _ = try r.stream(&amp;amp;writer.interface, .unlimited);
    try writer.interface.flush();
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what should the size of &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; be? If this was a one-and-done, maybe we'd leave it empty or put some seemingly sensible default, like 1K or 4K. If it was a mission critical piece of code, maybe we'd benchmark it or make it platform dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But unless I'm missing something, whatever size we use, this function's behavior is undefined. You see, the issue is that readers can require a specific buffer sizes on a writer (and writers can require a specific buffer size on a reader). For example, this code, with a small buffer of 64, fails an assertion in debug mode, and falls into an endless loop in release mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var fixed = std.Io.Reader.fixed(&amp;amp;.{
        40, 181, 47, 253, 36, 110, 149, 0, 0, 88, 111, 118, 101, 114, 32, 57,
        48, 48, 48, 33, 10, 1, 0, 192, 105, 241, 2, 170, 69, 248, 150
    });

    var decompressor = std.compress.zstd.Decompress.init(&amp;amp;fixed, &amp;amp;.{}, .{});
    try output(&amp;amp;decompressor.reader);
}

fn output(r: *std.Io.Reader) !void {
    const stdout = std.fs.File.stdout();
    var buffer: [64]u8 = undefined;
    var writer = stdout.writer(&amp;amp;buffer);
    _ = try r.stream(&amp;amp;writer.interface, .unlimited);
    try writer.interface.flush();
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some might argue that this is a documentation challenge. It's true that the documentation for &lt;code&gt;zstd.Decompress&lt;/code&gt; mentions what a &lt;code&gt;Writer&lt;/code&gt;'s buffer must be. But this is not a documentation problem. There are legitimate scenarios where the nature of a &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt; is unknown (or, at least, difficult to figure out). A type of a reader could be conditional, say based on an HTTP response header. A library developer might take a &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt; as an input and present their own &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt; as an output - what buffer requirement should they document?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worse is that the failure can be conditional on the input. For example, if we change our source to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;var fixed = std.Io.Reader.fixed(&amp;amp;.{
    40, 181, 47, 253, 36, 11, 89, 0, 0, 111, 118, 101, 114, 32, 57,
    48, 48, 48, 33, 10, 112, 149, 178, 212,
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything works, making this misconfiguration particularly hard to catch early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me this seems almost impossible - like, I must be doing something wrong. And if I am, I'm sorry. But, if I'm not, this is a problem right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;These days, systemd can be a cause of restrictions on daemons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the traditional rites of passage for Linux system administrators is having a daemon not work in the normal system configuration (eg, when you boot the system) but work when you manually run it as root. The classical cause of this on Unix was that $PATH wasn't fully set in the environment the daemon was running in but was in your root shell. On Linux, another traditional cause of this sort of thing has been SELinux and a more modern source (on Ubuntu) has sometimes been AppArmor. All of these create hard to see differences between your root shell (where the daemon works when run by hand) and the normal system environment (where the daemon doesn't work). These days, we can add another cause, an increasingly common one, and that is systemd service unit restrictions, many of which are covered in systemd.exec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(One pernicious aspect of systemd as a cause of these restrictions is that they can appear in new releases of the same distribution. If a daemon has been running happily in an older release and now has surprise issues in a new Ubuntu LTS, I don't always remember to look at its .service file.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of systemd's protective directives simply cause failures to do things, like access user home directories if ProtectHome= is set to something appropriate. Hopefully your daemon complains loudly here, reporting mysterious 'permission denied' or 'file not found' errors. Some systemd settings can have additional, confusing effects, like PrivateTmp=. A standard thing I do when troubleshooting a chain of programs executing programs executing programs is to shim in diagnostics that dump information to /tmp, but with PrivateTmp= on, my debugging dump files are mysteriously not there in the system-wide /tmp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(On the other hand, a daemon may not complain about missing files if it's expected that the files aren't always there. A mailer usually can't really tell the difference between 'no one has .forward files' and 'I'm mysteriously not able to see people's home directories to find .forward files in them'.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you don't get explicit errors, just mysterious failures to do some things. For example, you might set IP address access restrictions with the intention of blocking inbound connections but wind up also blocking DNS queries (and this will also depend on whether or not you use systemd-resolved). The good news is that you're mostly not going to find standard systemd .service files for normal daemons shipped by your Linux distribution with IP address restrictions. The bad news is that at some point .service files may start showing up that impose IP address restrictions with the assumption that DNS resolution is being done via systemd-resolved as opposed to direct DNS queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I expect some Linux distributions to resist this, for example Debian, but others may declare that using systemd-resolved is now mandatory in order to simplify things and let them harden service configurations.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, you can usually test if this is the problem by creating a version of the daemon's .service file with any systemd restrictions stripped out of it and then seeing if using that version makes life happy. In the future it's possible that some daemons will assume and require some systemd restrictions (for instance, assuming that they have a /tmp all of their own), making things harder to test.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This remains one of my proudest projects, and Iâm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to design something entirely new from the ground up. It was a chance to explore fresh paradigms, invent new patterns, and bring a product to life that hadnât existed before.

    &lt;p&gt;3-Panel Structure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthesizes learnings into a scalable and adaptive layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the core problems we set out to solve with NotebookLM was âtab overwhelmâ the scattered, fractured experience of jumping between tools while trying to synthesize ideas. We wanted to create a space where every part of the creation journey could happen in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â Inputs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outputs â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¢ Citations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¢ Multiple entry points&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This visual shows how the core building blocks came together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure you see now may seem obvious but it took After what felt like 1000 iterations to get there. Trying to put these blocks together in a way that allowed for a clear mental model and digstible UI. These early sketches are from a plane. I ran out of paper and ultimately found the final solution when drawing on a napkin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mental model of NotebookLM was built around the creation journey: starting with inputs, moving through conversation, and ending with outputs. Users bring in their sources (documents, notes, references), then interact with them through chat by asking questions, clarifying, and synthesizing before transforming those insights into structured outputs like notes, study guides, and Audio Overviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By grounding the design in this linear but flexible flow (Inputs â Chat â Outputs) we gave users a clear sense of place within the product while keeping the complexity of new AI interactions digestible and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs rare to find a product that brings reading, writing, and creation together in a truly integrated way largely because juggling all three can be overwhelming. But with AI reducing friction, the opportunity emerged to design a space where every part of the creative process could coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make that possible, I designed a responsive panel system that adapts to the userâs needs, scaling fluidly while preserving quick access to key elements like sources and notes, even at the smallest sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default layout, offering a balanced view of sources, chat, and notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimized for referencing sources and generating responses with citations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A popular request, designed for users focused on drafting and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideal for composing while keeping source material in view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To optimize spatial utility, I created a set of responsive panels that scale based on user needs, retaining essential icons for sources and notes even at minimal widths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scalability was a core principle. While the content within these panels can shift and evolve, the underlying system is built to support growth, accommodating new tools, modes, and workflows without breaking the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the 90s, television was a different experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You turned on the TV, and whatever was playing at that moment would become your entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays you yourself are in control, you choose what you want to see, whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, I miss that feeling of having something selected for me, something I cannot influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's just my nostalgic musings, but why not create an afternoon project out of it and actually find out if there's something more to this nostalgic feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Take a Raspberry Pi (I used a cheap tiny Raspberry Pi 3A+)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Fill the SD card with all your favorite shows from your childhood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Add a script that starts playing those shows in a random order at startup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to have it plugged into a television or monitor and I can just turn it on whenever I feel like watching some random 90's tv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's currently playing on my device:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- StarGate SG-1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Saved by the Bell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Friends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Dinosaurs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Family Matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Simpsons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- X-Files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Home Improvement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Sliders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- 3rd Rock from the Sun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Wonder Years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Married with Children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- ALF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- MacGyver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Xena: Warrior Princess&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just a list to get started with, if you have any more 90's tips, let me know! (Mastodon details at the bottom)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This really only took an afternoon, it's that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take an SD card and install Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Raspberry Pi's imaging software, make sure to preconfigure it so it connects to the wifi and that you have your authentication details set (I made a user account called 'retro')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the image is made, boot it up with your raspberry pi and ensure that you can log in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When logged in, create a video folder to store your files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;mkdir video&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then take the SD card, plug it back into your computer (you might need a linux pc for this) and dump all your videos into a newly created 'video' folder in the root of your home directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the above is too much of a hassle for you, you can just as well just keep these videos on an attached USB stick, just make sure to update the path in the script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install the software needed to play the videos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install vlc pulseaudio&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save the following script in the root of your home directory as startVideo.sh (nano startVideo.sh):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#!/bin/bash VIDEO_DIR=&amp;amp;quot/home/retro/video&amp;amp;quot pulseaudio --start pactl set-default-sink 1 mapfile -t video_files &amp;amp;lt &amp;amp;lt(find &amp;amp;quot$VIDEO_DIR&amp;amp;quot -type f | shuf) for video in &amp;amp;quot${video_files[@]}" do cvlc --fullscreen --play-and-exit &amp;amp;quot$video&amp;amp;quot done&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This just makes a list of all your videos, shuffles them and feeds them to VLC for playing. (use cvlc instead of vlc when you don't need an interface)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pactl command was needed in my case to ensure the audio also outputs over hdmi, if you are using the headphone jack, just leave out this line, note that this might differ on other Raspberry Pi devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to adjust the VIDEO_DIR path to wherever you are storing the videos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure it's always playing, we'll make a systemd service so it auto starts playing at startup:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save the following file as /etc/systemd/system/videoplayer.service (you can use sudo nano followed by the file location)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;[Unit] Description=Video Player Service After=multi-user.target [Service] User=retro Group=retro ExecStart=/home/retro/startVideo.sh Restart=always [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then register it as a service:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;sudo systemctl enable videoplayer&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reboot and cross your fingers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now I just have this plugged into a spare monitor (that has speakers built-in), but I'm looking for a small CRT to put in the corner of my office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would involve finding a HDMI to SCART, HDMI to s-video or similar convertor though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV, Nostalgia, HomeLab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get in touch through Mastodon:&lt;/p&gt;@rxpz@social.linux.pizza&lt;p&gt;TV Time Machine: A Raspberry Pi That Plays Random 90s TV was published on 2025-09-20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bringing restartable sequences out of the niche&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;A restartable sequences overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the number of CPUs in a system grows, so does the desire to write and run highly parallel programs. In user space, as well as in the kernel, concurrent code using locks eventually runs into scalability problems, leading to an interest in the use of lockless algorithms instead. The kernel has a distinct advantage when it comes to lockless concurrent access, though, in that code running in kernel space can prevent interruptions from interrupts, preemption, or migration to another CPU during critical sections; user space has no such guarantees. So any user-space lockless algorithm must work correctly in an environment where code execution can be interrupted at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restartable sequences are one solution to this problem. To use this feature, an application must designate a critical section that does some work, culminating in a single atomic instruction that commits whatever change is being made. One of the earliest uses of restartable sequences was a memory allocator that would, within its critical section, identify an object to allocate from a per-CPU list, then remove it from that list with an atomic compare-and-exchange operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ sudo subscribe today&lt;p&gt;Subscribe today and elevate your LWN privileges. You’ll have access to all of LWN’s high-quality articles as soon as they’re published, and help support LWN in the process. Act now and you can start with a free trial subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would obviously be problematic if this critical section were to be interrupted between the identification of the object to allocate and the final step committing the change. To work around this problem, the application informs the kernel of the critical section by filling a structure (struct rseq_cs) describing the address range of the instructions within that section, along with a special abort address. If the kernel interrupts the execution of the relevant thread, to preempt it, move it to another CPU, or to deliver a signal, it will, on return to user space check for the existence of this structure. If the current instruction pointer lies within the critical section, the kernel will cause execution to jump to the abort address. The thread can then clean up after its aborted attempt and restart the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hope, of course, is that most runs through the critical section will complete without interruption, accomplishing their job in about the fastest way possible. The extra overhead of dealing with aborts only enters the picture in cases where the critical section is interrupted for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using restartable sequences requires setting up a shared memory area using the rseq() system call. The actual critical section almost certainly must be written in assembly. Until relatively recently, there was no support for restartable sequences in the GNU C Library (glibc), though that has been changing. Given the effort that is required to use this feature properly, and given that it is a Linux-only feature, it is not surprising that relatively few application developers have made use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Not so niche anymore&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shared-memory area set up by rseq() allows a thread to tell the kernel when it is executing in a critical section, but the communication through that area goes both ways. Whenever the kernel runs a thread, it will update this area to reflect which CPU and NUMA node the thread ended up on. That information is used by glibc to accelerate functions like sched_getcpu(), which can obtain the needed information directly without calling into the kernel. Other uses of restartable sequences within glibc are under consideration; Mathieu Desnoyers (the creator of this feature) has been advocating for increased use of it within glibc to improve scalability for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, there has been interest in another feature intended to help user space write efficient critical sections: time-slice extension. The idea here is that a thread running in a critical section (perhaps holding a lock) could indicate that fact to the kernel as a way of politely asking to not be preempted, even if its time slice runs out. The kernel could, if it is in a good mood, respond by giving the thread a little bit more time to finish its work and release the lock, so that other threads can proceed. It makes obvious sense to tie a feature like this to restartable sequences, so the time-slice-extension patch set added the "please can I run a little longer" bit to the shared area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time-slice extension is a feature that affects the core CPU scheduler, and it is likely to see wider use, so it is not surprising that it has brought more attention to restartable sequences. Thomas Gleixner dug into the patches and, not entirely liking what he saw, put together a proposal for an improved interface for time-slice extension. His changes are likely to be the way this work proceeds in the future, and may merit an article on its own, but Gleixner also found a few things to improve in the restartable-sequences code as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The trouble with restartable sequences&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; His observations in this area led to the posting of a separate patch set aimed at addressing the problems he found with restartable sequences. The end result is significantly improved performance, which is a good thing given that the performance cost of restartable sequences has been starting to attract attention. Jens Axboe, for example, responded to the series saying: "&lt;quote&gt;I'd see rseq at 2-3% of overall CPU time last I tested&lt;/quote&gt;". Kernel developers will work long and hard to eliminate a performance hit much smaller than that. A couple of the things that Gleixner fixed are good examples of how the combination of history and oversights can slow things down. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways in which a user-space thread might lose access to the CPU. The restartable-sequences code in current kernels maintains a field, rseq_event_mask, in each thread's task_struct structure to track those ways; there are separate bits for preemption, the delivery of a signal, and migration to a different CPU. So, for example, if the kernel ends up delivering a signal to a task, it will set the RSEQ_EVENT_SIGNAL bit in rseq_event_mask. When the time comes to return to user space after whatever has happened, rseq_need_restart() will be called to see if a critical section was interrupted; in that case, rseq_event_mask will be consulted to see whether the critical section should be continued, or whether the thread should instead be diverted to the abort address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gleixner noticed a couple of interesting problems with this code. One is that the kernel is constantly setting the bits in rseq_event_mask, but those bits are only cleared in rseq_need_restart(), and only when the thread happens to be executing within a critical section at the time. Otherwise those bits just pile up there. That is likely to result in a spurious restart the next time an interrupt occurs while the thread is executing within a critical section, taking away some of the performance advantage that the restartable sequences feature was added to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps more tellingly, though, those bits exist to allow a thread to specify when its critical section should be aborted. Given the nature of any given section, some sorts of events do not risk breaking the algorithm; a thread might be able to handle a signal without risking concurrent access to data needed by its critical sections, for example. But that feature was deprecated for the 6.0 release in 2022; it added complexity without bringing a lot of value. That deprecation was of a relatively severe variety; any process trying to use that feature would be immediately killed with a SIGSEGV signal. So the chances are pretty good that there are no actual users of the feature in the wild now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gleixner replaced all of that machinery with a single "an event happened" boolean value. This elimination also allowed the removal of some accesses to user-space memory, which speeds things up. User-space access from the kernel is never entirely cheap, and the need for Spectre mitigations has made it even slower. As a separate optimization, the series changes the remaining user-space access to the masked user-space-access primitives (added in 6.12) that carry a lower mitigation cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two ways that a thread running in user space can end up switching to kernel mode: an interrupt happens, or the thread makes a system call. All of the cases that restartable sequences are meant to handle will be the result of an interrupt of some type or another. Threads in critical sections are not supposed to make system calls at all. When running on a kernel built with the DEBUG_RSEQ configuration option, making a system call while in a critical section will result in the immediate termination of the offending process — a gentle hint that the restartable sequences feature is not being used correctly. Without that option (as will be the case in production systems), though, the kernel will handle a system-call return in the same way as an interrupt return: if the thread is running in a critical section and an event has occurred, control will be redirected to the abort handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gleixner's work separates the handling of the interrupt and system-call case, since the time-slice-extension feature will only apply for the former. As an optimization, he removed the restartable-sequences handling for system-call returns; the relevant patch notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This changes the current behaviour, which just blindly fixes up the critical section unconditionally in the syscall case. But that's a user space problem when it invokes a syscall from within a critical section and expects it to work. That code was clearly never tested on a debug kernel and user space can keep the pieces.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are users that behave in this way, and the code has worked so far, they may be in for an unpleasant surprise once this change goes in. That would likely become the cause of an interesting conversation; "user space was always broken" is not normally considered an acceptable argument for causing a working program to break. There is a good chance that this change will have to be reverted if trouble appears. Given the relatively limited use of restartable sequences so far, though, there is reason to hope that no such user exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It may be a little while until we find out, anyway. This work will need review, including, presumably, a look at how it interacts with the time-slice extension work. For extra fun, Gleixner has let it be known that he has found more things to fix, so further patches will be forthcoming. But, at their core, the current changes appear to make sense, addressing problems that have managed to sneak into the code over the years. Almost any body of code can benefit from restarted development involving a fresh set of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

Posted Aug 23, 2025 1:42 UTC (Sat) by comex (subscriber, #71521) [Link] There's a compiler flag to specify the minimum OS version you need to run on. Meanwhile, every declaration in every system header is marked with a minimum OS version, so you get an error if you accidentally use a newer function (this can be disabled for functionality you want to use conditionally). In more subtle cases, header files can manually check the target version with #if and change their behavior, though this is rarely done. The goal is that you can always use the latest SDK, even if you are targeting an old OS version (though there is a limit to how far back you can go). I think glibc would be well-served if it adopted a similar scheme.

    &lt;p&gt; Pathology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases, particularly cancer, through examination of patient tissue samples. With an estimated 70% of important medical decisions involving laboratory or pathology tests [2], the availability of digitally stored pathology images is especially important as it has a significant impact on patient care. The digital transformation of pathology also means there is a growing need for scalable storage to meet new data volumes and computing resources, which also allows full AI adoption in clinical and research environments. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the international standard for medical images and related patient information. Because digital pathology is a relatively new imaging modality compared to radiology and others, there was no established DICOM standard in place. As a result, vendors created their own proprietary formats.&lt;lb/&gt; Today, Philips announced that it is expanding its SG300 and SG60 scanner offering with the Pathology Scanner SGi with configurable DICOM JPEG and DICOM JPEG XL output. As a result, it is the first in the world to offer native DICOM JPEG XL output. DICOM JPEG XL output files are up to 50% smaller while still providing the same high image quality [3], enabling pathology labs to store, manage, and analyze growing volumes of digital pathology data and enable more productive workflows in the cloud and on premise.&lt;lb/&gt; “The adoption of DICOM in pathology marks an important shift toward achieving scalable, interoperable imaging workflows, said Imogen Fitt, Principal Analyst at Signify Research. “As pathology labs face mounting data volumes and storage demands, the move to standardized formats helps reduce infrastructure costs and enables integration with a wider range of AI tools. Philips’ support for DICOM JPEG and DICOM JPEG XL as a native output from its scanners illustrates how vendors are aligning with these trends, intending to support capabilities such as centralized archiving, cross-modality diagnostics, and remote collaboration for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some time soon, perhaps next year, SpaceX will attempt to fly one of its enormous Starship rockets from low-Earth orbit back to its launch pad in South Texas. A successful return and catch at the launch tower would demonstrate a key capability underpinning Elon Musk's hopes for a fully reusable rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order for this to happen, SpaceX must overcome the tyranny of geography. Unlike launches over the open ocean from Cape Canaveral, Florida, rockets departing from South Texas must follow a narrow corridor to steer clear of downrange land masses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All 10 of the rocket's test flights so far have launched from Texas toward splashdowns in the Indian or Pacific Oceans. On these trajectories, the rocket never completes a full orbit around the Earth, but instead flies an arcing path through space before gravity pulls it back into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Starship's next two test flights go well, SpaceX will likely attempt to send the soon-to-debut third-generation version of the rocket all the way to low-Earth orbit. The Starship V3 vehicle will measure 171 feet (52.1 meters) tall, a few feet more than Starship's current configuration. The entire rocket, including its Super Heavy booster, will have a height of 408 feet (124.4 meters).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starship, made of stainless steel, is designed for full reusability. SpaceX has already recovered and reflown Super Heavy boosters, but won't be ready to recover the rocket's Starship upper stage until next year, at the soonest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's one of the next major milestones in Starship's development after achieving orbital flight. SpaceX will attempt to bring the ship home to be caught back at the launch site by the launch tower at Starbase, Texas, located on the southernmost section of the Texas Gulf Coast near the US-Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was always evident that flying a Starship from low-Earth orbit back to Starbase would require the rocket to fly over Mexico and portions of South Texas. The rocket launches to the east over the Gulf of Mexico, so it must approach Starbase from the west when it comes in for a landing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
