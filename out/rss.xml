      &lt;p&gt;One of my Phonak Audeo 90’s (RIC) died the other day after 5 years and I’m shopping for new. What’s your go to hearing aid currently if you’ve upgraded recently or have been thinking of doing so?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Moderate loss, have worn them for many years, enjoy listening to music and nature, but also need help in meetings and noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not worried about cost and wanting to get one more good deal out of work insurance before I retire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Japan's high-stakes gamble to turn island of flowers into global chip hub&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley - or "Hokkaido Valley", as some have begun to call it - the country could become a new contender in the $600bn (£458bn) race to supply the world's computer chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An unlikely player&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government has invested $12bn in the company, so that it can build a massive semiconductor factory or "fab" in the small city of Chitose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonise with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key milestone for Rapidus came with the delivery of an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) system from the Dutch company ASML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high-tech machinery helped bring about Rapidus' biggest accomplishment yet earlier this year – the successful production of prototype two nanometre (2nm) transistors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These ultra-thin chips are at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and allow devices to run faster and more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a feat only rival chip makers TSMC and Samsung have accomplished. Intel is not pursuing 2nm, it is leapfrogging from 7nm straight to 1.8nm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We succeeded in manufacturing the 2nm prototype for the first time in Japan, and at an unprecedented speed in Japan and globally," Mr Koike said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He credits the IBM partnership for helping achieve the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tie-ups with global companies are essential to acquiring the technology needed for this level of chips, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The sceptics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rapidus is confident that it is on track to mass produce 2nm chips by 2027. The challenge will be achieving the yield and quality that is needed to survive in an incredibly competitive market – the very areas where Taiwan and South Korea have pulled ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC for example has achieved incredible success in mass production, but making high-end chips is costly and technically demanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a 2024 report, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office highlighted that although Rapidus is receiving government subsidies and consortium members are contributing funds: "The financing falls short of the expected 5 trillion yen ($31.8bn; £24.4bn) needed to start mass production."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has previously said: "Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavour from companies with the requisite experience (ie TSMC and Samsung)."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding customers may also be a challenge – Samsung and TSMC have established relationships with global companies that have been buying their chips for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The lost decades&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Japan's government is pouring money into the chip industry - $27bn between 2020 and early 2024 - a larger commitment relative to its gross domestic product (GDP) than the US made through the Biden-era CHIPS Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, Tokyo unveiled a $65bn package for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors that could further support Rapidus's expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comes after decades of decline. Forty years ago Japan made more than half of the world's semiconductors. Today, it produces just over 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many point to US-Japan trade tensions in the 1980s as a turning point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naoyuki Yoshino, professor emeritus at Keio University, said Japan lost out in the technology stakes to Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s, leaving domestic companies weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike its rivals, Japan failed to sustain subsidies to keep its chipmakers competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Mr Koike says that mentality has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The [national] government and local government are united in supporting our industry to revive once again."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan's broader economic challenges also loom large. Its population is shrinking while the number of elderly citizens continues to surge. That has determined the national budget for years and has contributed to slowing growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than a third of its budget now goes to social welfare for the elderly, and that squeezes the money available for research, education and technology, Prof Yoshino says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan also faces a severe shortage of semiconductor engineers – an estimated 40,000 people in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rapidus is partnering with Hokkaido University and others to train new workers, but agrees it will have to rely heavily on foreigners, at a time when public support for workers coming into the country for employment is low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Growing an ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government's push is already attracting major global players.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC is producing 12–28nm chips in Kumamoto, on the south-western island of Kyushu - a significant step for Japan, even if it lags behind the company's cutting-edge production in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The expansion has transformed the local economy, attracting suppliers, raising wages, and leading to infrastructure and service developments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan's broader chip revival strategy appears to be following a playbook: establish a "fab", and an entire ecosystem will tend to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC started building a second plant on Kyushu in October this year, which is due to begin production by the end of 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond Rapidus and TSMC, local players like Kioxia and Toshiba are also getting government backing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kioxia has expanded fabs in Yokkaichi and Kitakami with state funds and Toshiba has built one in Ishikawa. Meanwhile, ROHM has been officially designated as a company that provides critical products under Tokyo's economic security framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American memory chipmaker Micron will also receive $3.63bn in subsidies from the Japanese government to grow facilities in Hiroshima, while Samsung is building a research and development facility in Yokohama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hokkaido is seeing similar momentum. Chipmaking equipment companies ASML and Tokyo Electron have both opened offices in Chitose, off the back of Rapidus building a production facility there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This will make a form of 'global ecosystem'," Mr Koike says, "where we work together to be able to produce semiconductors that contribute to the world."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr Koike said Rapidus's key selling point would be - as its name suggests - an ability to produce custom chips faster than competitors, rather than competing directly with other players.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"TSMC leads the world, with Intel and Samsung close behind. Our edge is speed - we can produce and deliver chips three to four times faster than anyone else. That speed is what gives us an edge in the global semiconductor race," Mr Koike said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big bet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global demand for chips is surging with the rise of AI, while Japan's automakers - still recovering from pandemic-era supply shocks - are pressing for more reliable, domestically or regionally sourced production across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing control over chip manufacturing is being seen as a national security priority, both in Japan and elsewhere, as recent trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan raise concerns around the risks of relying on foreign suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We'd like to provide products from Japan once again – products that are powerful and with great new value," Mr Koike said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Japan's government, investing in Rapidus is a high-stakes gamble to revive its semiconductor industry and more broadly its tech power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And some analysts say it may be the country's best chance to build a domestic ecosystem to supply advanced chips to its many manufacturers, and one day become a formidable challenger in the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;RuBee&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have at least a few readers for which the sound of a man's voice saying "government cell phone detected" will elicit a palpable reaction. In Department of Energy facilities across the country, incidences of employees accidentally carrying phones into secure areas are reduced through a sort of automated nagging. A device at the door monitors for the presence of a tag; when the tag is detected it plays an audio clip. Because this is the government, the device in question is highly specialized, fantastically expensive, and says "government cell phone" even though most of the phones in question are personal devices. Look, they already did the recording, they're not changing it now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things that I love is weird little wireless networks. Long ago I wrote about ANT+, for example, a failed personal area network standard designed mostly around fitness applications. There's tons of these, and they have a lot of similarities---so it's fun to think about the protocols that went down a completely different path. It's even better, of course, if the protocol is obscure outside of an important niche. And a terrible website, too? What more could I ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DoE's cell-phone nagging boxes, and an array of related but more critical applications, rely on an unusual personal area networking protocol called RuBee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RuBee is a product of Visible Assets Inc., or VAI, founded in 2004 1 by John K. Stevens. Stevens seems a somewhat improbable founder, with a background in biophysics and eye health, but he's a repeat entrepreneur. He's particularly fond of companies called Visible: he founded Visible Assets after his successful tenure as CEO of Visible Genetics. Visible Genetics was an early innovator in DNA sequencing, and still provides a specialty laboratory service that sequences samples of HIV in order to detect vulnerabilities to antiretroviral medications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in the early 2000s exposed Visible Genetics to one of the more frustrating parts of health care logistics: refrigeration. Samples being shipped to the lab and reagents shipped out to clinics were both temperature sensitive. Providers had to verify that these materials had stayed adequately cold throughout shipping and handling, otherwise laboratory results could be invalid or incorrect. Stevens became interested in technical solutions to these problems; he wanted some way to verify that samples were at acceptable temperatures both in storage and in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, Stevens imagined that these sensors would be in continuous communication. There's a lot of overlap between this application and personal area networks (PANs), protocols like Bluetooth that provide low-power communications over short ranges. There is also clear overlap with RFID; you can buy RFID temperature sensors. VAI, though, coined the term visibility network to describe RuBee. That's visibility as in asset visibility: somewhat different from Bluetooth or RFID, RuBee as a protocol is explicitly designed for situations where you need to "keep tabs" on a number of different objects. Despite the overlap with other types of wireless communications, the set of requirements on a visibility network have lead RuBee down a very different technical path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visibility networks have to be highly reliable. When you are trying to keep track of an asset, a failure to communicate with it represents a fundamental failure of the system. For visibility networks, the ability to actually convey a payload is secondary: the main function is just reliably detecting that endpoints exist. Visibility networks have this in common with RFID, and indeed, despite its similarities to technologies like BLE RuBee is positioned mostly as a competitor to technologies like UHF RFID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several differences between RuBee and RFID; for example, RuBee uses active (battery-powered) tags and the tags are generally powered by a complete 4-bit microcontroller. That doesn't necessarily sound like an advantage, though. While RuBee tags advertise a battery life of "5-25 years", the need for a battery seems mostly like a liability. The real feature is what active tags enable: RuBee operates in the low frequency (LF) band, typically at 131 kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that low frequency, the wavelength is very long, about 2.5 km. With such a long wavelength, RuBee communications all happen at much less than one wavelength in range. RF engineers refer to this as near-field operation, and it has some properties that are intriguingly different from more typical far-field RF communications. In the near-field, the magnetic field created by the antenna is more significant than the electrical field. RuBee devices are intentionally designed to emit very little electrical RF signal. Communications within a RuBee network are achieved through magnetic, not electrical fields. That's the core of RuBee's magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of magnetic coupling is not unique to RuBee. Speaking of the near-field, there's an obvious comparison to NFC which works much the same way. The main difference, besides the very different logical protocols, is that NFC operates at 13.56 MHz. At this higher frequency, the wavelength is only around 20 meters. The requirement that near-field devices be much closer than a full wavelength leads naturally to NFC's very short range, typically specified as 4 cm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At LF frequencies, RuBee can achieve magnetic coupling at ranges up to about 30 meters. That's a range comparable to, and often much better than, RFID inventory tracking technologies. Improved range isn't RuBee's only benefit over RFID. The properties of magnetic fields also make it a more robust protocol. RuBee promises significantly less vulnerability to shielding by metal or water than RFID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two key scenarios where this comes up: the first is equipment stored in metal containers or on metal shelves, or equipment that is itself metallic. In that scenario, it's difficult to find a location for an RFID tag that won't suffer from shielding by the container. The case of water might seem less important, but keep in mind that people are made mostly of water. RFID reading is often unreliable for objects carried on a person, which are likely to be shielded from the reader by the water content of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These problems are not just theoretical. WalMart is a major adopter of RFID inventory technology, and in early rollouts struggled with low successful read rates. Metal, moisture (including damp cardboard boxes), antenna orientation, and multipath/interference effects could cause read failure rates as high as 33% when scanning a pallet of goods. Low read rates are mostly addressed by using RFID "portals" with multiple antennas. Eight antennas used as an array greatly increase read rate, but at a cost of over ten thousand dollars per portal system. Even so, WalMart seems to now target a success rate of only 95% during bulk scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;95% might sound pretty good, but there are a lot of visibility applications where a failure rate of even a couple percent is unacceptable. These mostly go by the euphemism "high value goods," which depending on your career trajectory you may have encountered in corporate expense and property policies. High-value goods tend to be items that are both attractive to theft and where theft has particularly severe consequences. Classically, firearms and explosives. Throw in classified material for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if Stevens was surprised by RuBee's market trajectory. He came out of the healthcare industry and, it seems, originally developed RuBee for cold chain visibility... but, at least in retrospect, it's quite obvious that its most compelling application is in the armory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because RuBee tags are small and largely immune to shielding by metals, you can embed them directly in the frames of firearms, or as an aftermarket modification you can mill out some space under the grip. RuBee tags in weapons will read reliably when they are stored in metal cases or on metal shelving, as is often the case. They will even read reliably when a weapon is carried holstered, close to a person's body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since RuBee tags incorporate an active microcontroller, there are even more possibilities. Temperature logging is one thing, but firearm-embedded RuBee tags can incorporate an accelerometer (NIST-traceable, VAI likes to emphasize) and actually count the rounds fired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sidebar time: there is a long history of political hazard around "smart guns." The term "smart gun" is mostly used more specifically for firearms that identify their user, for example by fingerprint authentication or detection of an RFID fob. The idea has become vague enough, though, that mention of a firearm with any type of RFID technology embedded would probably raise the specter of the smart gun to gun-rights advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, devices embedded in firearms that count the number of rounds fired have been proposed for decades, if not a century, as a means of accountability. The holder of a weapon could, in theory, be required to positively account for every round fired. That could eliminate incidents of unreported use of force by police, for example. In practice I think this is less compelling than it sounds, simple counting of rounds leaves too many opportunities to fudge the numbers and conceal real-world use of a weapon as range training, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the NRA has long been vehemently opposed to the incorporation of any sort of technology into weapons that could potentially be used as a means of state control or regulation. The concern isn't completely unfounded; the state of New Jersey did, for a time, have legislation that would have made user-identifying "smart guns" mandatory if they were commercially available. The result of the NRA's strident lobbying is that no such gun has ever become commercially available; "smart guns" have been such a political third rail that any firearms manufacturer that dared to introduce one would probably face a boycott by most gun stores. For better or worse, a result of the NRA's powerful political advocacy in this area is that the concept of embedding security or accountability technology into weapons has never been seriously pursued in the US. Even a tentative step in that direction can produce a huge volume of critical press for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bring this up because I think it explains some of why VAI seems a bit vague and cagey about the round-counting capabilities of their tags. They position it as purely a maintenance feature, allowing the armorer to keep accurate tabs on the preventative maintenance schedule for each individual weapon (in armory environments, firearm users are often expected to report how many rounds they fired for maintenance tracking reasons). The resistance of RuBee tags to concealment is only positioned as a deterrent to theft, although the idea of RuBee-tagged firearms creates obvious potential for security screening. Probably the most profitable option for VAI would be to promote RuBee-tagged firearms as tool for enforcement of gun control laws, but this is a political impossibility and bringing it up at all could cause significant reputational harm, especially with the government as a key customer. The result is marketing copy that is a bit odd, giving a set of capabilities that imply an application that is never mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VAI found an incredible niche with their arms-tracking application. Institutional users of firearms, like the military, police, and security forces, are relatively price-insensitive and may have strict accounting requirements. By the mid-'00s, VAI was into the long sales cycle of proposing the technology to the military. That wasn't entirely unsuccessful. RuBee shot-counting weapon inventory tags were selected by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in 2010 for installation on SCAR and M4 rifles. That contract had a five-year term, it's unclear to me if it was renewed. Military contracting opened quite a few doors to VAI, though, and created a commercial opportunity that they eagerly pursued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, weapons applications required an impressive round of safety and compatibility testing. RuBee tags have the fairly unique distinction of military approval for direct attachment to ordnance, something called "zero separation distance" as the tags do not require a minimum separation from high explosives. Central to that certification are findings of intrinsic safety of the tags (that they do not contain enough energy to trigger explosives) and that the magnetic fields involved cannot convey enough energy to heat anything to dangerous temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's not the only special certification that RuBee would acquire. The military has a lot of firearms, but military procurement is infamously slow and mercurial. Improved weapon accountability is, almost notoriously, not a priority for the US military which has often had stolen weapons go undetected until their later use in crime. The Navy's interest in RuBee does not seem to have translated to more widespread military applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you have police departments, probably the largest institutional owners of firearms and a very lucrative market for technology vendors. But here we run into the political hazard: the firearms lobby is very influential on police departments, as are police unions which generally oppose technical accountability measures. Besides, most police departments are fairly cash-poor and are not likely to make a major investment in a firearms inventory system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That leaves us with institutional security forces. And there is one category of security force that are particularly well-funded, well-equipped, and beholden to highly R&amp;amp;D-driven, almost pedantic standards of performance: the protection forces of atomic energy facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protection forces at privately-operated atomic energy facilities, such as civilian nuclear power plants, are subject to licensing and scrutiny by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Things step up further at the many facilities operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Protection forces for NNSA facilities are trained at the Department of Energy's National Training Center, at the former Manzano Base here in Albuquerque. Concern over adequate physical protection of NNSA facilities has lead Sandia National Laboratories to become one of the premier centers for R&amp;amp;D in physical security. Teams of scientists and engineers have applied sometimes comical scientific rigor to "guns, gates, and guards," the traditional articulation of physical security in the nuclear world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That scope includes the evaluation of new technology for the management of protection forces, which is why Oak Ridge National Laboratory launched an evaluation program for the RuBee tagging of firearms in their armory. The white paper on this evaluation is curiously undated, but citations "retrieved 2008" lead me to assume that the evaluation happened right around the middle of the '00s. At the time, VAI seems to have been involved in some ultimately unsuccessful partnership with Oracle, leading to the branding of the RuBee system as Oracle Dot-Tag Server. The term "Dot-Tag" never occurs outside of very limited materials around the Oracle partnership, so I'm not sure if it was Oracle branding for RuBee or just some passing lark. In any case, Oracle's involvement seems to have mainly just been the use of the Oracle database for tracking inventory data---which was naturally replaced by PostgreSQL at Oak Ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Oak Ridge trial apparently went well enough, and around the same time, the Pantex Plant in Texas launched an evaluation of RuBee for tracking classified tools. Classified tools are a tricky category, as they're often metallic and often stored in metallic cases. During the trial period, Pantex tagged a set of sample classified tools with RuBee tags and then transported them around the property, testing the ability of the RuBee controllers to reliably detect them entering and exiting areas of buildings. Simultaneously, Pantex evaluated the use of RuBee tags to track containers of "chemical products" through the manufacturing lifecycle. Both seem to have produced positive results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are quite a few interesting and strange aspects of the RuBee system, a result of its purpose-built Visibility Network nature. A RuBee controller can have multiple antennas that it cycles through. RuBee tags remain in a deep-sleep mode for power savings until they detect a RuBee carrier during their periodic wake cycle. When a carrier is detected, they fully wake and listen for traffic. A RuBee controller can send an interrogate message and any number of tags can respond, with an interesting and novel collision detection algorithm used to ensure reliable reading of a large number of tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual RuBee protocol is quite simple, and can also be referred to as IEEE 1902.1 since the decision of VAI to put it through the standards process. Packets are small and contain basic addressing info, but they can also contain arbitrary payload in both directions, perfect for data loggers or sensors. RuBee tags are identified by something that VAI oddly refers to as an "IP address," causing some confusion over whether or not VAI uses IP over 1902.1. They don't, I am confident saying after reading a whole lot of documents. RuBee tags, as standard, have three different 4-byte addresses. VAI refers to these as "IP, subnet, and MAC," 2 but these names are more like analogies. Really, the "IP address" and "subnet" are both configurable arbitrary addresses, with the former intended for unicast traffic and the latter for broadcast. For example, you would likely give each asset a unique IP address, and use subnet addresses for categories or item types. The subnet address allows a controller to interrogate for every item within that category at once. The MAC address is a fixed, non-configurable address derived from the tag's serial number. They're all written in the formats we associate with IP networks, dotted-quad notation, as a matter of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's about it as far as the protocol specification, besides of course the physical details which are a 131,072 Hz carrier, 1024 Hz data clock, either ASK or BPSK modulation. The specification also describes an interesting mode called "clip," in which a set of multiple controllers interrogate in exact synchronization and all tags then reply in exact synchronization. Somewhat counter-intuitively, because of the ability of RuBee controllers to separate out multiple simultaneous tag transmissions using an anti-collision algorithm based on random phase shifts by each tag, this is ideal. It allows a room, say an armory, full of RuBee controllers to rapidly interrogate the entire contents of the room. I think this feature may have been added after the Oak Ridge trials...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RuBee is quite slow, typically 1,200 baud, so inventorying a large number of assets can take a while (Oak Ridge found that their system could only collect data on 2-7 tags per second per controller). But it's so robust that it an achieve a 100% read rate in some very challenging scenarios. Evaluation by the DoE and the military produced impressive results. You can read, for example, of a military experiment in which a RuBee antenna embedded in a roadway reliably identified rifles secured in steel containers in passing Humvees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, then, one of the benefits of RuBee in the military/defense context is that it is also difficult to receive. Here is RuBee's most interesting trick: somewhat oversimplified, the strength of an electrical radio signal goes as 1/r, while the strength of a magnetic field goes as 1/r^3. RuBee equipment is optimized, by antenna design, to produce a minimal electrical field. The result is that RuBee tags can very reliably be contacted at short range (say, around ten feet), but are virtually impossible to contact or even detect at ranges over a few hundred feet. To the security-conscious buyer, this is a huge feature. RuBee tags are highly resistant to communications or electronic intelligence collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the logical implications of tagging the military's rifles. With conventional RFID, range is limited by the size and sensitivity of the antenna. Particularly when tags are incidentally powered by a nearby reader, an adversary with good equipment can detect RFID tags at very long range. VAI heavily references a 2010 DEFCON presentation, for example, that demonstrated detection of RFID tags at a range of 80 miles. One imagines that opportunistic detection by satellite is feasible for a state intelligence agency. That means that your rifle asset tracking is also revealing the movements of soldiers in the field, or at least providing a way to detect their approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most RuBee tags have their transmit power reduced by configuration, so even the maximum 100' range of the protocol is not achievable. VAI suggests that typical RuBee tags cannot be detected by radio direction finding equipment at ranges beyond 20', and that this range can be made shorter by further reducing transmit power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, we have caught the attention of the Department of Energy. Because of the short range of RuBee tags, they have generally been approved as not representing a COMSEC or TEMPEST hazard to secure facilities. And that brings us back to the very beginning: why does the DoE use a specialized, technically interesting, and largely unique radio protocol to fulfill such a basic function as nagging people that have their phones? Because RuBee's security properties have allowed it to be approved for use adjacent to and inside of secure facilities. A RuBee tag, it is thought, cannot be turned into a listening device because the intrinsic range limitation of magnetic coupling will make it impossible to communicate with the tag from outside of the building. It's a lot like how infrared microphones still see some use in secure facilities, but so much more interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VAI has built several different product lines around RuBee, with names like Armory 20/20 and Shot Counting Allegro 20/20 and Store 20/20. The founder started his career in eye health, remember. None of them are that interesting, though. They're all pretty basic CRUD applications built around polling multiple RuBee controllers for tags in their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there's the "Alert 20/20 DoorGuard:" a metal pedestal with a RuBee controller and audio announcement module, perfect for detecting government cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the strangest things about RuBee is that it's hard to tell if it's still a going concern. VAI's website has a press release section, where nothing has been posted since 2019. The whole website feels like it was last revised even longer ago. When RuBee was newer, back in the '00s, a lot of industry journals covered it with headlines like "the new RFID." I think VAI was optimistic that RuBee could displace all kinds of asset tracking applications, but despite some special certifications in other fields (e.g. approval to use RuBee controllers and tags around pacemakers in surgical suites), I don't think RuBee has found much success outside of military applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RuBee's resistance to shielding is impressive, but RFID read rates have improved considerably with new DSP techniques, antenna array designs, and the generally reduced cost of modern RFID equipment. RuBee's unique advantages, its security properties and resistance to even intentional exfiltration, are interesting but not worth much money to buyers other than the military.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that's the fate of RuBee and VAI: defense contracting. As far as I can tell, RuBee and VAI are about as vital as they have ever been, but RuBee is now installed as just one part of general defense contracts around weapons systems, armory management, and process safety and security. IEEE standardization has opened the door to use of RuBee by federal contractors under license, and indeed, Lockheed Martin is repeatedly named as a licensee, as are firearms manufacturers with military contracts like Sig Sauer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides, RuBee continues to grow closer to the DoE. In 2021, VAI appointed Lisa Gordon-Hagerty to it board of directors. Gordon-Hagerty was undersecretary of Energy and had lead the NNSA until the year before. This year, the New Hampshire Small Business Development Center wrote a glowing profile of VAI. They described it as a 25-employee company with a goal of hitting $30 million in annual revenue in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the outdated website, VAI claims over 1,200 RuBee sites in service. I wonder how many of those are Alert 20/20 DoorGuards? Still, I do believe there are military weapons inventory systems currently in use. RuBee probably has a bright future, as a niche technology for a niche industry. If nothing else, they have legacy installations and intellectual property to lean on. A spreadsheet of VAI-owned patents on RuBee, with nearly 200 rows, encourages would-be magnetically coupled visibility network inventors not to go it on their own. I just wish I could get my hands on a controller....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have found some conflicting information on the date, it could have been as early as 2002. 2004 is the year I have the most confidence in.↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The documentation is confusing enough about these details that I am actually unclear on whether the RuBee "MAC address" is 4 bytes or 6. Examples show 6 byte addresses, but the actual 1902.1 specification only seems to allow 4 byte addresses in headers. Honestly all of the RuBee documentation is a mess like this. I suspect that part of the problem is that VAI has actually changed parts of the protocol and not all of their products are IEEE 1902.1 compliant.↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Normal practice in deploying post-quantum cryptography is to deploy ECC+PQ. IETF's TLS working group is standardizing ECC+PQ. But IETF management is also non-consensually ramming a particular NSA-driven document through the IETF process, a "non-hybrid" document that adds just PQ as another TLS option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't worry: we're standardizing cars with seatbelts. Also, recognizing generous funding from the National Morgue Association, we're going to standardize cars without seatbelts as another option, ignoring the safety objections. That's okay, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month I posted part 1 of this story. Today's part 2 highlighted the corruption. This blog post, part 3, highlights the dodging in a particular posting at the beginning of this month by an IETF "security area director". Part 4 will give an example of how dissent on this topic has been censored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consensus means whatever the people in power want to do. Recall from my previous blog post that "adoption" of a document is a preliminary step before an IETF "working group" works on, and decides whether to standardize, the document. In April 2025, the chairs of the IETF TLS WG called for "adoption" of this NSA-driven document. During the call period, 20 people expressed unequivocal support for adoption, 2 people expressed conditional support for adoption, and 7 people expressed unequivocal opposition to adoption. (Details for verification.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chairs claimed that "we have consensus to adopt this draft". I promptly asked for explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the chairs could even reply, an "area director" interrupted, claiming, inter alia, the following: "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ... The vast majority was in favour of adoption ... There were a few dissenting opinions".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After these lies by the "area director" were debunked, the chairs said that they had declared consensus "because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft" specifically "enough people willing to review the draft".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can understand not everybody being familiar with the specific definition of "consensus" that antitrust law requires standards-development organizations to follow. But it's astonishing to see chairs substituting a consensus-evaluation procedure that simply ignores objections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stonewalling. The chairs said I could escalate. IETF procedures say that an unresolved dispute can be brought "to the attention of the Area Director(s) for the area in which the Working Group is chartered", and then "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I filed a complaint with the "security area directors" in early June 2025. One of them never replied. The other, the same one who had claimed that there was "clearly consensus", sent a series of excuses for not handling the complaint. For example, one excuse was that the PDF format "discourages participation".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do IETF procedures say "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute unless the dispute is documented in a PDF"? No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent email two days later systematically addressing the excuses. The "area director" never replied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It isn't clear under IETF procedures whether a non-reply allows an appeal. It is, however, clear that an appeal can't be filed after two months. I escalated to the "Internet Engineering Steering Group" (IESG) in August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(These aren't even marginally independent groups. The "area directors" are the IESG members. IESG appoints the WG chairs.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IESG didn't reply until October 2025. It rejected one of the "Area Director" excuses for having ignored my complaint, but endorsed another excuse. I promptly filed a revised complaint with the "area director", jumping through the hoops that IESG had set. There were then further runarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The switch. Suddenly, on 1 November 2025, IESG publicly instructed the "area director" to address the following question: "Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "area director" posted his conclusion mere hours later: "I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dodging procedural objections. Before looking at how the "area director" argued for this conclusion, I'd like to emphasize three things that the "area director" didn't do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, did the "area director" address my complaint about the chair action on this topic? No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason this matters is that the law requires standards-development organizations to provide an "appeals process". Structurally, the "area director" isn't quoting and answering the points in my complaint; the "area director" puts the entire burden on the reader to try to figure out what's supposedly answering what, and to realize that many points remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, did the "area director" address the chairs claiming that "we have consensus to adopt this draft"? Or the previous claim from the "area director" that there was "clearly consensus"? No. Instead IESG and this "area director" quietly shifted from "consensus" to "rough consensus". (Did you notice this shift when I quoted IESG's "rough consensus" instruction?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason this matters is that "consensus" is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations. The law doesn't allow "rough consensus". Also, IETF claims that "decision-making requires achieving broad consensus". "broad consensus" is even stronger than "consensus", since it's saying that there's consensus in a broad group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the way that my complaint had established the lack of consensus was, first, by reviewing the general definition of "consensus" (which I paraphrased from the definition in the law, omitting a citation only because the TLS chairs had threatened me with a list ban if I mentioned the law again), and then applying the components of that definition to the situation at hand. Did the area director follow this structure? Here's the definition of "consensus", or "rough consensus" if we're switching to that, and now let's apply that definition? No. Nobody reading this message from the "area director" can figure out what the "area director" believes these words mean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, look at that: "due process" is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations. Part of due process is simply making clear what procedures are being applied. Could it possibly be that the people writing the law were thinking through how standardization processes could be abused?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Numbers. Without further ado, let's look at what the "security area director" did write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The IESG has requested that I evaluate the WG Adoption call results for ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3 (draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement). Please see below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted above, IESG had instructed the "area director" to answer the following question: "Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Side note: Given that the "area director" posted all of the following on the same day that IESG instructed the "area director" to write this, presumably this was all written in advance and coordinated with the rest of IESG. I guess the real point of finally (on 1 November 2025) addressing the adoption decision (from 15 April 2025) was to try to provide cover for the "last call" a few days later (5 November 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ExecSum&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted above, the TLS WG chairs had claimed "consensus", and the "area director" had claimed that there was "clearly consensus". The "area director" is now quietly shifting to a weaker claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Timeline&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;April 1: Sean and Joe announce WG Adoption Call [ about 40 messages sent in the thread ]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"About 40"? What happened to the "area director" previously writing "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call"? And why is the number of messages supposed to matter in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;April 15: Sean announces the Adoption Call passed. [ another 50 messages are sent in the thread ]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Messages after the specified adoption-call deadline can't justify the claim that "the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document". The adoption call failed to reach consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;April 18 to today: A chain of (attempted) Appeals by D. J. Bernstein to the AD(s), IESG and IAB, parts of which are still in process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the ADs and IESG stonewalled in response to complaints doesn't mean that they were "attempted" complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Outcome&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;30 people participated in the consensus call, 23 were in favour of adoption, 6 against and 1 ambivalent (names included at the bottom of this email).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers are much closer to reality than the "area director" previously writing "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ... The vast majority was in favour of adoption ... There were a few dissenting opinions".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, given that the "area director" is continually making claims that aren't true (see examples below) and seems generally allergic to providing evidence (the text I'm quoting below has, amazingly, zero URLs), it's a relief to see the "area director" providing names to back up the claimed numbers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But somehow, even after being caught lying about the numbers before, the "area director" still can't resist shading the numbers a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual numbers were 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption, 2 people conditionally supporting adoption, and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption. Clearly 7 is close to 6, and 20+2 is close to 23, but, hmmm, not exactly. Let's check the details:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the "area director" end up with 6 negative votes rather than 7? By falsely listing Thomas Bellebaum as "ambivalent" and falsely attributing a "prefer not, but okay if we do" position to Bellebaum. In fact, Bellbaum had written "I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids." (This was in reply to Stephen Farrell, who had written "I'm opposed to adoption, at this time.")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the "area director" end up with 23 positive votes rather than 22? By falsely listing the document author (Deirdre Connolly) as having stated a pro-adoption position during the call. The "area director" seems generally clueless about conflict-of-interest issues and probably doesn't find it obvious that an author shouldn't vote, but the simple fact is that the author didn't vote. She sent three messages during the call period; all of those messages are merely commenting on specific points, not casting a vote on the adoption question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The document author didn't object to the "area director" fudging the numbers. Bellebaum did politely object; the "area director" didn't argue, beyond trying to save face with comments such as "Thanks for the clarification".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More to the point, the "area director" has never explained whether or how the tallies of positive and negative votes are supposed to be relevant to the "rough consensus" claim. The "area director" also hasn't commented on IETF saying that IETF doesn't make decisions by voting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bogus arguments for the draft. I mentioned in my previous blog post that IETF claims that "IETF participants use their best engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole Internet, not just the best solution for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In favour argument summary&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While there is a lack of substantiating why adoption is desired - which is typical&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, the "area director" seems to have some basic awareness that this document flunks the "engineering judgment" criterion. The "area director" tries to defend this by saying that other documents flunk too. So confidence-inspiring!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- the big use case seems to be to support those parties relying on NIST and FIPS for their security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wrong. Anything+PQ, and in particular ECC+PQ, complies with NIST's standards when the PQ part does. See NIST SP 800-227: "This publication approves the use of the key combiner (14) for any t &amp;gt; 1 if at least one shared secret (i.e., Sj for some j) is generated from the key-establishment methods in SP 800-56A [1] or SP 800-56B [2] or an approved KEM." For example, if the PQ part is ML-KEM as per FIPS 203, then NIST allows ECC+PQ too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's next: claiming that using PQ in an Internet protocol would violate NIST standards unless NIST has standardized that particular Internet protocol?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This encompasses much more than just the US government as other certification bodies and other national governments have come to rely on the outcome of the NIST competition, which was the only public multi-year post-quantum cryptography effort to evaluate the security of proposed new post-quantum algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won't bother addressing the errors here, since the bottom-line claim is orthogonal to the issue at hand. The TLS WG already has an ECC+PQ document using NIST-approved PQ; the question is whether to also have a document allowing the ECC seatbelt to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It was also argued pure PQ has less complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what would be even less complicated? Encrypting with the null cipher!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a claim that PQ is less complex than ECC+PQ. There was no response to Andrey Jivsov objecting that having a PQ option makes the ecosystem more complicated. The basic error in the PQ-less-complex claim is that it ignores ECC+PQ already being there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How the "area director" described the objections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opposed argument summary&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most of the arguments against adoption are focused on the fact that a failsafe is better than no failsafe, irrespective of which post-quantum algorithm is used,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the closest that the "area director" comes to acknowledging the central security argument for ECC+PQ. Of course, the "area director" spends as little time as possible on security. Compare this to my own objection to adoption, which started with SIKE as a concrete example of the dangers and continued with "SIKE is not an isolated example: https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp shows that 48% of the 69 round-1 submissions to the NIST competition have been broken by now".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;and that the practical costs for hybrids are negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmmm. By listing this as part of an "opposed argument summary", is the "area director" suggesting that this was disputed? When and where was the dispute?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted above, I've seen unquantified NSA/GCHQ fearmongering about costs, but that was outside IETF. If NSA and GCHQ tried the same arguments on a public mailing list then they'd end up being faced with questions that they can't answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It was also argued that having an RFC gives too much promotion or sense of approval to a not recommended algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wrote my own summary of the objections, I provided a quote and link for each point. The "area director" doesn't do this. If the "area director" is accurately presenting an argument that was raised, why not provide a quote and a link? Is the "area director" misrepresenting the argument? Making up a strawman? The reader can't tell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have expanded some of the arguments and my interpretation of the weight of these below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comment about "weight" is revealing. What we'll see again and again is that the "area director" is expressing the weight that he places on each argument (within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"), i.e., the extent to which he is convinced or not convinced by those arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that IESG has power under IETF rules to unilaterally block publications approved by WGs, it's unsurprising that the "area directors", in their roles as IESG members, will end up evaluating the merits of WG-approved documents. But that isn't what this "area director" was instructed to do here. There isn't a WG-approved document at this point. Instead the "area director" was instructed to evaluate whether the chairs "appropriately" called "rough consensus" to "adopt" the document. The "area director" is supposed to be evaluating procedurally what the WG decision-makers did. Instead the "area director" is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Non-hybrid as "basic flaw"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The argument by some opponents that non-hybrids are a "basic flaw" seems to miscategorize what a "basic flaw" is. There is currently no known "basic flaw" against MLKEM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that the "area director" is trying to make some sort of claim here about ML-KEM not having been attacked, but the wording is so unclear as to be unevaluatable. Why doesn't KyberSlash count? How about Clangover? How about the continuing advances in lattice attacks that have already reduced ML-KEM below its claimed security targets, the most recent news being from last month?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, claiming that ML-KEM isn't "known" to have problems is utterly failing to address the point of the ECC seatbelt. It's like saying "This car hasn't crashed, so the absence of seatbelts isn't a basic flaw".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As was raised, it is rather odd to be arguing we must immediately move to use post-quantum algorithms while at the same time argue these might contain fundamental basic flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the "area director" is reasonably capturing a statement from one document proponent (original wording: "I find it to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the quantum threat requires immediate work, and yet we are also somehow uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true at the same time").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I promptly followed up explaining the error: "Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do you believe they're contradictory?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was, of course, no reply at the time. The "area director" now simply repeats the erroneous argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As TLS (or IETF) is not phasing out all non-hybrid classics,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Non-hybrid classics" is weird terminology. Sometimes pre-quantum algorithms (ECC, RSA, etc.) are called "classical", so I guess the claim here is that using just ECC in TLS isn't being phased out. That's a bizarre claim. There are intensive efforts to roll out ECC+PQ in TLS to try to protect against quantum computers. Cloudflare reports the usage of post-quantum cryptography having risen to about 50% of all browsers that it sees (compared to 20% a year ago); within those connections, 95% use ECC+MLKEM768 and 5% use ECC+Kyber768.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "area director" also gives no explanation of why the "not phasing out" claim is supposed to be relevant here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I find this argument not strong enough&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See how the "area director" is saying the weight that the "area director" places on each argument (within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"), rather than evaluating whether there was consensus to adopt the document?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;to override the consensus of allowing non-hybrid standards from being defined&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Circular argument. There wasn't consensus to adopt the document in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;especially in light of the strong consensus for marking these as "not recommended".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think many readers will be baffled by this comment. If something is "not recommended", wouldn't that be an argument against standardizing it, rather than an argument for standardizing it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is that "not recommended" doesn't mean what you think it means: the "area director" is resorting to confusing jargon. I don't think there's any point getting into the weeds on this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incompetent planning for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Non-hybrids are a future end goal&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Additionally, since if/when we do end up in an era with a CRQC, we are ultimately designing for a world where the classic components offer less to no value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone is trying to argue for removing ECC, there's a big difference between the plausible scenario of ECC having "less" value and the extreme scenario of ECC having "no" value. It's wrong for the "area director" to be conflating these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I put it almost two years ago: "Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys. Yikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that! We don't even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break one key! Users who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography. But are the users going to say 'Let's turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack'? I'm skeptical. I think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let's think for a moment about the idea that one will eventually want to transition to just ML-KEM, the specific proposal that the "area director" is portraying as the future. Here are three ways that this can easily be wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe ML-KEM's implementation issues end up convincing the community to shift to a more robust option, analogously to what happened with ECC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe the advances in public attacks continue to the point of breaking ML-KEM outright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe the cliff stops crumbling and ML-KEM survives, but more efficient options also survive. At this point there are quite a few options more efficient than ML-KEM. (Random example: SMAUG. The current SMAUG software isn't as fast as the ML-KEM software, but this is outweighed by SMAUG using less network traffic than ML-KEM.) Probably some options will be broken, but ML-KEM would have to be remarkably lucky to end up as the most efficient remaining option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does this "area director" think that all of the more efficient options are going to be broken, while ML-KEM won't? Sounds absurdly overconfident. More likely is that the "area director" doesn't even realize that there are more efficient options. For anyone thinking "presumably those newer options have received less scrutiny than ML-KEM": we're talking about what to do long-term, remember?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking ML-KEM as the PQ component of ECC+PQ is working for getting something rolled out now. Hopefully ML-KEM will turn out to not be a security disaster (or a patent disaster). But, for guessing what will be best to do in 5 or 10 or 15 years, picking ML-KEM is premature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When and where to exactly draw the line of still using a classic component safeguard is speculation at best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the "area director" is clearly attacking a strawman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Already supporting pure post quantum algorithms now to gain experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is rolling out PQ supposed to be gaining experience that isn't gained from the current rollout of ECC+PQ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, I think it's important to call out the word "pure" here as incoherent, indefensible marketing. What we're actually talking about isn't modifying ML-KEM in any way; it's simply hashing the ML-KEM session key together with other inputs. Is ML-KEM no longer "pure" when it's plugged into TLS, which also hashes session keys? (The word "pure" also showed up in a few of the earlier quotes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;while not recommending it at this time seems a valid strategy for the future, allowing people and organizations their own timeline of deciding when/if to go from hybrid to pure PQ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we again see the area director making a decision to support the document, rather than evaluating whether there was consensus in the WG to adopt the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again getting the complexity evaluation backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Added complexity of hybrids&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There was some discussion on whether or not hybrids add more complexity, and thus add risk, compared to non-hybrids. While arguments were made that proper classic algorithms add only a trivial amount of extra resources, it was also pointed out that there is a cost of implementation, deployment and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the "area director" is again making the same mistake explained earlier: ignoring the fact that ECC+PQ is already there, and thus getting the complexity evaluation backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "thus add risk" logic is also wrong. Again, all of these options are more complex than the null cipher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the existence of draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design and the extensive discussions around "chempat" vs "xwing" vs "kitchensink" shows that there is at least some complexity that is added by the hybrid solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, the details of how to combine ECC with PQ in TLS are already settled and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking beyond TLS: Chempat hashes the transcript (similarly to TLS), making it robust for a wide range of protocols. The other options add fragility by hashing less for the sake of minor cost savings. Each of these options is under 10 lines of code. The "area director" exaggerates the complexity by mentioning "extensive discussions", and spends much more effort hyping this complexity as a risk than acknowledging the risks of further PQ attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's not as if the presence of this document has eliminated the discussions of ECC+PQ details, nor is there any credible mechanism by which it could do so. Again, the actual choice at hand is whether to have PQ as an option alongside ECC+PQ. Adding that option adds complexity. The "area director" is getting the complexity comparison backwards by instead comparing (1) PQ in isolation to (2) ECC+PQ in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Botching the evaluation of human factors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RFCs being interpreted as IETF recommendation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems there is disagreement about whether the existence of an RFC itself qualifies as the IETF defacto "recommending" this in the view of IETF outsiders/ implemeners whom do not take into account any IANA registry RECOMMENDED setting or the Mandatory-To-Implement (MTI) reommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would expect a purchasing manager to have instructions along the lines of "Buy only products complying with the standards", and to never see IETF's confusing jumble of further designations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is an area where we recently found out there is little consensus on an IETF wide crypto policy statement via an RFC. The decision on whether an RFC adds value to a Code Point should therefor be taken independently of any such notion of how outsiders might interpret the existence of an RFC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a security perspective, it's a big mistake to ignore the human factor, such as the impact of a purchasing manager saying "This is the most efficient standard so I'll pick that".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this case, while Section 3 could be considered informative, I believe Section 4 and Section 5 are useful (normative) content that assists implementers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this supposed to have something to do with the consensus question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And people have proposed extending the Security Considerations to more clearly state that this algorithm is not recommended at this point in time. Without an RFC, these recommendations cannot be published by the IETF in a way that implementers would be known to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, "known to consume"! There was, um, one of those, uh, studies showing the details of, um, how implementors use RFCs, which, uh, showed that 100% of the implementors diligently consumed the warnings in the RFCs. Yeah, that's the ticket. I'm sure the URL for this study is sitting around here somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's get back to the real world. Even if an implementor does see a "This document is a bad idea" warning, this simply doesn't matter when the implementors are chasing contracts issued by purchasing managers who simply care what's standardized and haven't seen the warning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's much smarter for the document to (1) eliminate making the proposal that it's warning about and (2) focus, starting in the title, on saying why such proposals are bad. This makes people more likely to see the warning, and at the same time it removes the core problem of the bad proposal being standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fictions regarding country actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Say no to Nation State algorithms&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The history and birth of MLKEM from Kyber through a competition of the international Cryptographic Community, organized through US NIST can hardly be called or compared to unilateral dictated nation state algorithm selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NIST repeatedly refused to designate the "NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process" as a "competition". It even wrote that the process "should not be treated as a competition".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certainly there were competition-like aspects to the process. I tend to refer to it as a competition. But in the end the selection of algorithms to standardize was made by NIST, with input behind the scenes from NSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There has been no other comparable public effort to gather cryptographers and publicly discuss post-quantum crypto candidates in a multi-years effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonsense. The premier multi-year effort by cryptographers to "publicly discuss post-quantum crypto candidates" is the cryptographic literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In fact, other nation states are heavily relying on the results produced by this competition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the objection from Stephen Farrell that the "area director" isn't quoting or linking to: "I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will certainly arise".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reading this objection, you can see how the "area director" is sort of responding to it by suggesting that everybody is following NIST (i.e., that the "certainly arise" part is wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's not true. NIST's selections are controversial. For example, ISO is considering not just ML-KEM but also&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classic McEliece, where NIST has said it's waiting for ISO ("After the ISO standardization process has been completed, NIST may consider developing a standard for Classic McEliece based on the ISO standard"), and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FrodoKEM, which NIST said "will not be considered further for standardization".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISO is also now considering NTRU, where the advertisement includes "All patents related to NTRU have expired" (very different from the ML-KEM situation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSI, which sets cryptographic standards for Germany, recommends not just ML-KEM but also FrodoKEM (which it describes as "more conservative" than ML-KEM) and Classic McEliece ("conservative and very thoroughly analysed"). Meanwhile China has called for submissions of new post-quantum proposals for standardization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could keep going, but this is enough evidence to show that Farrell's prediction was correct; the "area director" is once again wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The use of MLKEM in the IETF will not set a precedent for having to accept other nation state cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how the "area director" is dodging Farrell's point. If NSA can pressure the TLS WG into standardizing non-hybrid ML-KEM, why can't China pressure the TLS WG into standardizing something China wants? What criteria will IETF use to answer this question without leaving the WG "open to accusations of favouritism"? If you want people to believe that it isn't about the money then you need a really convincing alternative story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not recommending pure PQ right now&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There was a strong consensus that pure PQ should not be recommended at this time, which is reflected in the document. There was some discussion on RECOMMENDED N vs D, which is something that can be discussed in the WG during the document's lifecycle before WGLC. It was further argued that adopting and publishing this document gives the WG control over the accompanying warning text, such as Security Considerations, that can reflect the current consensus of not recommending pure MLKEM over hybrid at publication time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just rehashing earlier text, even if the detailed wording is a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The pure MLKEM code points exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Irrelevant. The question is whether they're being standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An international market segment that wants to use pure MLKEM exists&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"International"? Like Swedish company Ericsson setting up its "Ericsson Federal Technologies Group" in 2024 to receive U.S. military contracts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;as can be seen by the consensus call outcome&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Um, how?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;along with existing implementations of the draft on mainstream devices and software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, NSA waving around money has convinced some corporations to provide software. How is this supposed to justify the claim that "there was rough consensus to adopt the document"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a rough consensus to adopt the document&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeating a claim doesn't make it true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;with a strong consensus for RECOMMENDED N and not MTI, which is reflected in the draft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Irrelevant. What matters is whether the document is standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reasons to not publish MLKEM as an RFC seem more based on personal opinions of risk and trust not shared amongst all participants as facts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sort of dismissal might be more convincing if it were coming from someone providing more URLs and fewer easily debunked claims. But it's in any case not addressing the consensus question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Based on the above, I believe the WG Chairs made the correct call that there was rough consensus for adopting draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chairs claimed that "we have consensus to adopt this draft" (based on claiming that "there were enough people willing to review the draft", never mind the number of objections). That claim is wrong. The call for adoption failed to reach consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "area director" claimed that "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ... The vast majority was in favour of adoption ... There were a few dissenting opinions". These statements still haven't been retracted; they were and are outright lies about what happened. Again, the actual tallies were 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption, 2 people conditionally supporting adoption, and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without admitting error, the "area director" has retreated to a claim of "rough consensus". The mishmash of ad-hoc comments from the "area director" certainly doesn't demonstrate any coherent meaning of "rough consensus".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fascinating that IETF's advertising to the public claims that IETF's "decision-making requires achieving broad consensus", but IETF's WG procedures allow controversial documents to be pushed through on the basis of "rough consensus". To be clear, that's only if the "area director" approves of the documents, as you can see from the same "area director" issuing yet another mishmash of ad-hoc comments to overturn a separate chair decision in September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You would think that the WG procedures would define "rough consensus". They don't. All they say is that "51% of the working group does not qualify as 'rough consensus' and 99% is better than rough", not even making clear whether 51% of voters within a larger working group can qualify. This leaves a vast range of ambiguous intermediate cases up to the people in power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Running Cynthia for the first timeSeveral sample midis built-in. When starting Cynthia for the first time, these sample midis are listed in the " Play Folder" panel, and playback is automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At any point during playback, you may select another midi from the list. Playback seamlessly switches to the selected midi in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynthia supports realtime changes to settings during playback. This means you may adjust the Playback Mode, Playback Device, Volume and Speed without having to stop/restart playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Main toolbar links and their functionThe main toolbar is located near the top of Cynthia's window. From left to right, it has the links of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nav - Toggle display of navigation panel Play Folder - Show the "Play Folder" panel to play midis from a folder Play List - Show the "Play List" panel to play midis from a playlist Prev - Play previous midi file in list Rewind - Shift playback position back several seconds Stop - Stop playback Play - Toggle playback: When playing ( flashing) playback stops/when stopped ( static) playback starts Fast Forward - Shift playback position forward several seconds Next - Play next midi file in list Menu - Show menu Mixer - Show the Windows Mixer app Options - Show the Options window, to change Cynthia's appearance Help - Show (from rightmost column) or hide built-in help&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶How to play a list of midis in a folderFrom the main toolbar click " Play Folder" link (top left) to display the "Play Folder" panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Play Folder, there is no need for a playlist or setup. Just navigate to the folder in question and instantly play the midis within.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double click the " Home" entry at top of list (scroll up if not visible). The list will refresh with the names of your hard drives, pen sticks and other local storage devices. Double click a drive, then the subsequent folder(s) to the one that you want to play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list will update. Double click a specific midi to begin playback, or, click the " Play" link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toolbar Links Refresh - Refresh the playback list Fav - Show the "Favourites" window. Use this handy window to maintain a list of your favourite folders for quick access. Back - Go to the previous folder in navigation history Forward - Go to the next folder in navigation history&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tips: There is no need to stop playback before switching to another folder. Double click the new folder and wait several seconds for Cynthia to automatically recommence playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current folder will be remembered when Cynthia is restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶How to use a playlist to play a selection of midisThe standard ".m3u" playlist format is supported. This is a plain text file that contains the length of the midi in seconds, a title, and the location of each midi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynthia supports midi playback from local storage devices, such as hard disks, pen sticks etc. Internet urls are not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you already have a playlist in the m3u format saved on your disk, you can open it in Cynthia for playback. From the main toolbar click the " Play List" link (top left) to show the Play List panel. An additional toolbar presents. Click the " Open" link (if shown) or " Edit &amp;gt; Open". From the Open window, navigate to your playlist, select and click the "Open" button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contents of your playlist will load inside the Play List panel. Click the " Play" link to begin playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶How to make a playlistThere are several ways a playlist can be constructed. The first method is the easiest. From your computer explorer ("File Explorer" in Windows and "Files" in Ubuntu) navigate to the folder of midis. Highlight one or more midis files inside the folder and drag the selection onto Cynthia and let go of the mouse button. The " Play List" panel updates and displays the dropped midi files appended, to the list. Repeat this process for as many midi files as required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At anytime you may save the playlist. From the Play List toolbar, click the " Save As" link (if shown) or " Edit &amp;gt; Save As...". Type a name in the Save window and click the "Save" button to save the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that each time Cynthia saves your playlist to file, the midi files referenced inside it have their names adjusted automatically to work with the specific save location of the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most midi filenames in a playlist are relative, as they do not have the full drive, folder and filename, but rather a partial folder structure and the midi's name. This is to permit the movement of the midis and the playlist from one location to another without the need for the playlist to be specifically rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are curious at what the playlist format looks like, click the " Copy All" link (if shown) or " Edit &amp;gt; Copy All" to copy the entire playlist to Clipboard. Note Cynthia will use a full filename for each listed midi file, since the Clipboard cannot be referenced from a disk location. You may paste it into any text editor to view, modify, or rearrange the order of the midi files listed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To paste an altered playlist back into Cynthia, click the " Replace" link (if shown) or " Edit &amp;gt; Replace". The Play List panel will update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynthia has support for extended playlists. Note! A large playlist of 100,000+ midi files will use about 102MB of RAM and require a second or two to apply midi filename adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for playlist filtering is provided. An example: You may instruct Cynthia to list only ".mid" files by deselecting ".midi" and ".rmi" options from the "File Types" option panel (right column). The playlist itself remains unchanged - how Cynthia uses it changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toolbar Links Edit - Show edit menu New - Prompt to clear playlist Open - Open a playlist from file Save As - Save playlist to file Cut - Cut selected playlist item to Clipboard Copy - Copy selected playlist item to Clipboard Copy All - Copy entire playlist to Clipboard Paste - Add Clipboard playlist to end of current playlist Replace - Replace current playlist with Clipboard playlist Undo - Undo last change to playlist&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tips: The current playlist is remembered for next time Cynthia is started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To show or hide the above toolbar links, tick or untick the " Edit &amp;gt; Show Links on Toolbar" option. Unticking the option hides all links except " Edit" and " Paste".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Which playback method to use? Play Folder or Play List?If you're a lover of simplicity itself, wishing only to play midi files directly from your hard drive folders as is, or, you're a playlist fan, rest assured, switching between these two very different playback systems, is as easy as a single click on either the " Play Folder" or " Play List" links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whilst the Play Folder method is limited to playing only the files contained in the currently selected folder, there is zero setup, no list to be built, and playback can start without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Play List method on the other hand allows for a far more in depth custom playback experience. It supports the playback of midis across multiple disk drives, folders and in any assembled order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Cynthia's large capacity list can easily handle a very large playlist. For example a playlist of 10,000+ midis is just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And switching between these two playback methods can be done during playback without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: The playback options File Types, Playback Mode, Playback Device, Speed and Volume are shared between both playback systems, and do not change or require adjustment after a switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Option: Playback ModeLocated bottom of left column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playback mode (bottom left) determines how Cynthia plays the list of midis in the Play Folder or Play List panel (left column).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Play currently selected midi to the end, and stop playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeat One Repeat the currently selected midi without stopping playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeat All Play each midi in turn, working down the list (left column), then restart from the top. Playback initially starts at currently selected midi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All Once Each midi in the list is played working downward through the list. Playback stops at the end of the last midi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Random Continuously play a midi, selecting each new one randomly from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Option: File TypesLocated towards bottom of right column. There are three midi file types supported: ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi". The first two are identical file formats, only the file extension differs. The third format, ".rmi", is slightly different and contains additional multimedia information for Microsoft Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default all three file types are selected (lit black). In this state, all playable midi files are listed in the Play Folder and Play List panels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To restrict the file types to be played back, click the file type to deselect it. The list of midis (left column) updates to reflect the change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If all three options are deselected, Cynthia interprets this as if all three were selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Option: Playback DeviceLocated towards bottom of right column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default all midi playback is sent to the Windows Midi Mapper system - the default Windows midi note handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have more than one midi device installed on your computer, Cynthia can redirect the midi notes to that device instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, a midi device had been considered to be hardware. But now, with the advent of powerful computer hardware, software can now act as virtual hardware, allowing for advanced features to be included on your computer without the need for hardware upgrades or physical adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A midi software driver can support a soundfont, which can greatly enhances the playback quality of a midi through it's support for large, high-quality, instrumental sound libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change the playback device, select a number in the playback device control (bottom right). Up to ten devices (1-10) is supported. "Map" is the Windows Midi Mapper. Selecting a dash will cause playback to stop producing audible sound (no device selected for sound output). In this case, the last usable (numbered) midi device will be automatically selected after a short time delay, recommencing audible playback without the need for user input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynthia supports realtime device switching during playback. A small, momentary interruption to playback may occur during a device change. The name of the device in use by Cynthia is listed in the playback device control (bottom right), for example as "Playback Device: Midi Mapper". In later versions of Microsoft Windows the Midi Mapper was discontinued - in this case, Cynthia uses the first installed midi device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that using another device may require a separate adjustment to that device's volume control, some devices do, and some do not. If it does have a volume control, it is more than likely to be accessible via Windows "Volume Mixer" application. Click the " Mixer" link from the top toolbar to display the application and adjust the volume control of your device accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Option: SpeedLocated towards bottom of right column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, Cynthia plays back a midi at normal speed (100%). Drag the slider to the right to increase the playback speed up to a maximum speed of 1,000% or 10x normal speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To slow down playback speed, drag the slider to the left. A value less than 100% slows playback to less than normal speed. The slider can go as low as 10% or 1/10th normal playback speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playback speed may be adjusted at any point during playback. All changes take place in realtime. An auto-fade in feature momentarily quietens playback to avoid any sudden or unexpected notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For maximum compatibility between different operating systems and device types (hardware and software) and their capabilities, Cynthia employs a multi-layer volume control system which adjusts both hardware and midi note volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To adjust playback volume, position the slider to the right to increase the volume and to the left to decrease it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An increase above 100% boosts the midi volume, making low-level, hard to hear midis, more discernable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Option: Playback ProgressAdjust playback position with a single click or tap. Additionally, hovering a mouse cursor over the Playback Progress bar displays a vertical marker for the new playback time and position. Click to apply new position. The midi playback will shift to a new position and automatic fade in eases back playback volume to avoid sudden clicks, pops or abrupt notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use keyboard arrow keys to progressively move forward or backward through the midi. A vertical marker will display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not currently playing? Click in the Playback Progress bar to commence playback at that position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶LyricsSynchronised lyric display is supported for midis with lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable lyrics, from the main toolbar click the " Menu" link and tick "Show Lyrics".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When included within a midi, lyrics are displayed inside the Playback Progress bar (bottom of Cynthia) as "Playback Progress - Lyrics:" with several words or part words visible at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A midi without lyrics will display "Playback Progress".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If hyphenated lyrics are required in order to highlight the pauses between part-words, from main toolbar click the " Menu" link and tick "Hyphenate Lyrics".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Always on MidiSometimes there can be a short, noticeable playback delay when commencing playback, initially. This delay is preparation time for Cynthia to ready playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no delay switching between midis during playback as Cynthia remains connected to the midi device. By default, after a short period of no playback (5 seconds or more), the midi device will switch to offline, and a short delay will occur when playback is next started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid this delay, the "Always on Midi" option may be used to keep a midi device online, even when Cynthia is not playing. From the main toolbar click the " Menu" option and tick the "Always on Midi" option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: You can always tell if the midi device is online or not - from the "Midi Information" panel on the right. Look for the item called "Device" in the "Technical list". This will either be "Online" or "Offline".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶What midi formats are supported?Midis comes in various format types. The simplest is format 0, a single track format, that stores all it's tempo (speed), notes and commands on a single, mixed track.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A format 1 midi, on the other hand, uses a dedicated master track (first track) to store all of it's tempo (speed) commands for the entire midi. Notes and commands are stored separately on additional, multiple tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynthia supports both format 0 and format 1 midis with file extension ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third, format 2 midi exists. This format type is not supported by Cynthia. In addition, Cynthia does not support system exclusive messages. These messages will be ignored, and typically relate to manufacturer specific equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Using an Xbox Controller to control CynthiaCynthia must be setup to use an Xbox Controller. From the top toolbar select "Menu &amp;gt; Xbox Controller" and select the "Active Only" or "Active and Inactive" option. Pair an Xbox Controller to your computer (if not already done). Cynthia automatically detects and uses active Xbox Controllers. More than one controller can be used at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;⏶Change the coloring of the app's GUIFrom top toolbar click " Options" or app menu "... &amp;gt; Options" (top right of window). An "Options" window will display. Select " Color" tab to show list of color schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "Color Schemes" list is split into three sections: 1. Built-In color schemes - read only/use as is 2. Custom color schemes - user customisable and labelled Custom 1-10 3. Saved color schemes - user customisable and saved as file(s) on disk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 160+ built-in color schemes to choose from. Simply select a color scheme to apply in realtime. For instance, Aqua Marine. Watch as the app's GUI changes color instantly - no need for an additional load, apply, or set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Blaiz Enterprises' color scheme (*.bcs) at its core is a list of twenty colors, responsible for coloring most aspects of the app's GUI. Some specialised colors are derived automatically from these. Two colors for the frame, nine for important areas, Title colors, and nine more for common zones, Standard colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each built-in color scheme has it's own unique set of colors. A custom color scheme allows for colors to be customised. To create a custom color scheme, scroll down the list to the section titled "Custom". He you'll find ten custom color scheme slots - each fully customisable in realtime without any need to be named, saved or applied. Tap or click on a slot to start - for example slot 1 - "Custom 1".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the right a series of editable color palettes will appear. Click a palette to display the color dialog window. Adjust color as desired and click OK when done. Alternatively, click and drag your mouse cursor/fingertip from the color palette to acquire color from your computer screen in realtime. App GUI continuously updates to reflect changes in color. All changes are automatically saved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Give your new color scheme a nameWant your shiny new color scheme to have its own name? Easy. From the color schemes list - click "Options &amp;gt; Color" to display dialog - scroll down to the "Custom" section, select your custom color scheme, and click " Menu &amp;gt; Save As...". Type a name and click the "Save" button. Your color scheme is saved to disk and listed under the "Saved" section of the color schemes list - next section down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any color scheme can be saved to disk, and then edited. For instance, you can select one of the built-in color schemes, such as Aqua Marine, and save it to disk, then customise as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶How to use your named color schemeClick "Options &amp;gt; Color" to show the color schemes list. Scroll down to the last section named "Saved". This section presents a list of all your saved color schemes in one central location. Select a scheme to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Can I edit my saved color scheme without having to re-save it/load it etc?Yes. Any saved color scheme can be customised without fuss. Click "Options &amp;gt; Color" and scroll down to the section named "Saved", click the color scheme you wish to edit, and adjust the color(s) as desired. All changes are saved automatically back to the file on disk, without any need to explicitly save.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶What is a background schemeA background scheme is a static or animated image tiled across the background layer of the app. The app's GUI components sit above this layer/merge into it, such as toolbars, tool images, buttons, text etc. There are 60 built-in background schemes, based on several images with different presets, like horizontal and vertical scroll speeds, fade in and out rates, and wobble levels. These functions allow for a static image to give movement to the app. While some background schemes are specially set for animation, others are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The background image can be rendered in full color, or shade-shifted toward greyscale, or shade-shifted toward the app's current highlight color. One slider, Colorise, controls this tri-function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A background scheme supports a maximum image color depth of 32 bits in RGBA format - 8 bit red, green, blue, and alpha channels - for instance a transparent PNG image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: An animated background scheme can operate at frame rates of up to 20 fps (frames per second), which means the entire GUI of the app is repainted in full, 20 times per second, like a video, and therefore can consume quite a bit of CPU power, especially at high resolutions. It is recommended a modern, powerful machine be used for high frame rates/resolutions in order to maintain smooth operation of the GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sliders and their meanings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strength (0..255): Determines how much of the background image is seen/made visible. A low value renders the background subtly beneath the GUI, whereas a high value, 100-255, renders it boldly. A value above 100 is disabled by default. To enable, click "Options &amp;gt; Settings" and deselect "Display &amp;gt; Safe Background". A value over 100 may overpower the GUI making it hard to navigate or operate. If this becomes the case, press the "F2" key, and then the Enter key to confirm restoration of the app's default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colorise (-100..100): Set the color rendering method. A value of 100 renders the background image in full color, a value of 0 in greyscale, and a value of -100 in the app's current highlight color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed (0..20): Paint speed in frames per second. 0 is static - the background scheme only repaints when required. This is the least stressful option. A value of 1-20 sets a constant repaint cycle of 1-20 fps (frames per second).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Horizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll (-100..100): Moves background image left/up (minus value) or right/down (plus value) by X pixels. A value of zero turns movement off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Horizontal Wobble/Vertical Wobble (0..300): Applies a wobble factor to the above Horizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll movement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fade In/Out (0..50): Cycles through a high-to-low-to-high intensity flow, gradually fading the background image from view, then back again, in a continuous cycle. Use a low value for a slow cycle, and a high value for a fast cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fade Wobble (0..200): Applies a wobble factor to the Fade In/Out flow cycle above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Can I customise a background scheme/background imageYes you can. There are 10 custom background scheme slots. Click "Options &amp;gt; Background" and scroll down to the section named "Custom". For instance, click on "Custom 1". A sub-toolbar will display in the right column at the top. From there, you can paste in an image from Clipboard - click "Paste", or open an image from file - click "File".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For best visual results, your image should be a similar size to the app's overall area, and be prepped for tiling work - that is, have it's right and bottom edges modified so that its colors/pixels seamlessly wrap back round to its opposing edge (right-to-left and top-to-bottom). You can use a tile creation app, or a good quality graphics app to accomplish this, or use our "Blend It" app to prep your image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without this, tiling the image may present abrupt edges of unwanted opposing lines of horizontal/vertical colors, and be visually jarring in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adjust the sliders as required to accomplish animation and visual effects. All changes to the image and sliders are saved in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶How do I change the frame style, size and sparkle strength/effect?The frame on our apps have a long history reaching back to the late 1990s, where they first adorned our FastCards and PowerCards (still/animated electronic musical greeting cards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of an app, they primarily serve as a large, easy-grip area for resizing the app's overall size, and a touch of decoration to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A frame can be made wide or narrow as required. The modern app has a typical frame width of 7 px in a plain style, so as not to distract or occupy excessive screen real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a frame may render with an optional, randomised sparkle effect, with a range of 0 (no sparkle) to 20 (heavy sparkle).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click "Options &amp;gt; Frame" to edit the app's current frame settings. A list of 50 built-in frames is available to choose from, ranging from Antique to Traditional 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toward the bottom of the window are two sliders to adjust the frame's Sparkle (strength) and Size (width in pixels). A frame can be sized from 0 px (no frame) up to a wide frame of 72 px. All changes update in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Automatic zoom and scaling of app text and images on high resolution displaysClick "Options &amp;gt; Font" to display zoom and font specific settings. By default, the app is set to automatic zoom, which means it will scale up its text and images if the monitor it's displayed on is above 2K in resolution. Why scale text and images at all? What is special about 4K and 8K monitors? At first glance it may not be obvious the significant difference between standard 2K resolution, and the much higher 4K and 8K resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But high resolution monitors, such as 4K and 8K displays have far more pixels (colored dots) per inch on screen than previous generations of monitors, that is, the screen size may be the same but more dots are packed into the same area. Consequently, an app without scaling abilities may appear small or even blurred on these monitors. That's because as new monitors and TVs gain ever greater resolutions, statically sized apps shrink in size/fail to compensate. This is why a modern app must be able to scale up to match the appropriate resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a comparison of common display resolutions: 2K = 1920w x 1080h = 2,073,600 pixels 4K = 3840w x 2160h = 8,294,400 pixels 8K = 7680w x 4320h = 33,177,600 pixels&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 4K (ultra high definition) monitor uses four times (4x) more pixels than it's 2K (full high definition) counterpart. A statically built app without scaling would shrink to 50% of it's size, making it difficult to use. An operating system may attempt to counter this by scaling it up using pixel stretching - very much like zooming up a photo - unfortunately this tends to blur the appearance of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same app on an 8K monitor would suffer even greater shrinkage, rendering at only a quarter (25%) of it's original size, or scaling with significant blurring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This app has a built-in zoom mode, which multiples the width and height of its text and images by a factor of 2, 3, or 4, dependant on the resolution of the display. This does away for the need of the operating system to stretch/scale its pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a 2K monitor there is no need to scale as this is the app's intended resolution. On a 4K monitor the app switches to a zoom factor of 200% (2x), upscaling text and images and the main window's dimension accordingly, and 400% (4x) on an 8K monitor. The end result is an app that appears appropriately sized over different monitor resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can override this automatic zoom function, and set your own zoom value of: 100%, 200%, 300%, or 400%, if desired. An option that may be useful on a custom display resolution, and/or multiple monitor display environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Setting the zoom value to 300% or above on a 2K monitor may render the app so large as to make it unusable. If this occurs, you can press the "F2" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Change app text sizeThe text size (font size) can be set between 6 and 24. Click "Options &amp;gt; Font" and choose a size option. Any change updates the app text in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some instances, the app may display slightly larger or smaller text in special areas, however this text is directly scaled from the size set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default the app uses a size of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Not all sizes are supported by all fonts. On Ubuntu for instance, a large font size for Arial can cause text to appear weird or slightly off. If this occurs, try reducing the font size a tad, or alternatively select another font (font name).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Change app fontA font determines what sort of characters appear on the screen, and in what style. Click "Options &amp;gt; Font" and choose a font name (font) from the list of options, from Arial to DejaVu Serif. Any change updates the app in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Older fonts like "System" were simple formats constructed from small images or bitmaps, one per character, and did not scale up very well, partly because to save on memory, not all character sizes were stored inside the font. Today, modern fonts use mathematical vectoring to draw shapes and lines etc to construct characters on the screen, though the infrastructure and overhead required for such fonts can be complex and heavy on a computer system. But because these fonts employ mathematics to draw their characters, they do scale up well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eleven common font name options are presented for best compatibility and visual appearance, taking into consideration operating systems as old as Window 95, through to modern-day Windows 11, and other systems such as Mac and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, you want a font that is widely supported and guaranteed to render well on most computers. Bearing that in mind, Arial, is a good choice, as it is widely supported by operating systems going as far back as Windows 95, if not further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a font name is selected but is not supported by the current computer, for example "DejaVu Sans" - not supported by Windows 95 - a close approximate/fallback font is used instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a specific/custom font, click the "Custom" option once to switch it on, and click it again to display a Font dialog. Choose the font name from the list of fonts and click the "OK" button when done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the app becomes unreadable, or hard to read after choosing a new font name - it can happen with a bad font, a foreign language font, or a symbols only font like "Wingdings" - press the "F2" key to restore the app's default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Change app font feathering/antialiasingFor maximum font compatibility, two completely separate methods have been employed to render text with antialiasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click "Options &amp;gt; Font" for font settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. The first method, Font Feathering, is a simple feather designed specifically to outline each text character in realtime. This has the effect of gently softening the often harsh outline of text characters on LCD screens, which by their nature do not blur neighbouring pixels, as the older CRT (Cathode Ray Tubes) did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feather is universally applied to both bitmap fonts (older image based fonts) and vectors fonts (newer mathematical fonts). In this way it allows for a quick and direct text feathering technique, that is easily adjusted to suit, without any need for any complicated or tricky multi-step setup configurations and/or processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a bonus, it works on older operating systems - e.g. Windows 95 - which back in the day had no need/support for it, as LCD monitors were not widely used. It also works on fonts that don't have any embedded feather information, or for smaller font sizes that at times can abruptly discontinue feather support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method generates an even, edge-based blurring of the outermost pixels of the text characters. A high value - high or ultra - renders a strong/bold feather, and a low value reduces this to a more subtle display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any change updates in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a high quality computer monitor were all pixels are transmitted and displayed without any color loss, a "Low" value is typically sufficient to render text gently on the screen. But TVs, which tend to heavily compress their video streams for speed loose some color information and therefore may require a higher setting of "Medium" or "High" for similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. The second method, Font Specific Antialiasing, relies on the font itself to provide all feather based information. This is usually an 8 bit greyscale range of 0-255. The downside is, if the font has no feather support, or the operating system is old, e.g. Windows 95, then no antialiasing will appear. This method can sometimes be hit and miss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, take the font Arial, it is universally supported, but surprisingly looses feather support at 12 pt or less, leaving only sharp text characters to be rendered on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To adjust the antialiasing strength, select an option from "Dark" (strong) to "Light" (subtle).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, options 1 and 2 above are set to "Low/Dark", which provides the best fit for a wide variety of fonts and their behavior over a broad spectrum of old and new operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶App startup styleThe app can be set to start up in various ways: normally, minimised, maximised or in fullscreen mode. To adjust, click "Options &amp;gt; Settings" and set an option under "Start Style".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normal: Starts the app as a window, which is the default mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimised: Starts the app hidden from view as a button on your taskbar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximised: Starts the app as a window, maximised to fill all the available work area on your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fullscreen: Starts the app in fullscreen mode, blocking out everything else on your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: If the app has the "Multi-Monitor" option selected (next section down named "Display"), then modes "Maximised" and "Fullscreen" will render the app over the combined screen real estate of all monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Create a link to the app on your Start button and Desktop, and the Automatic Startup optionThe app can create, maintain and remove links for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three link types supported: 1. Start button 2. Desktop 3. Automatic Startup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click "Options &amp;gt; Settings" to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. The first link type, Start button, creates and automatically maintains a link - also known as a shortcut - on your Start Menu called "Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com". As this link is created by and maintained by the app, you must unselect the option to remove the link from your Start Menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. The Desktop link operates identically to the above, maintaining a link on your Desktop named "Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com". It also must be unselected to remove the link permanently from your Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: As long as either options 1 or 2 above is selected, then the corresponding links are maintained and automatically re-created if need be by the app, even if they're manually deleted from outside the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, neither option is selected. Optionally, you can create your own manual link/shortcut to the app using Windows with any name/label you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. The last option, Automatic Startup, creates a link to the app in the startup location of your computer, informing Windows to launch the app when your computer boots/starts up. Again, this link is automatically maintained, therefore unselect the option to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: If any of the links above are selected and you plan to remove/delete the app from your computer, it is highly recommended you first unselect all the options above (1-3), then remove/delete the app. Otherwise, Windows can get a little weird and put the links back in some cases without any interaction from the app itself, even if the app is no longer present. This behaviour was observed with earlier versions of Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶A few important app settings explainedThe majority of the app's important system settings can be found in one location - click "Options &amp;gt; Settings".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An option is considered "on/enabled/selected" when lit, and "off/disabled/unselected" when unlit. Round Corners: Render all visual controls, windows, and dialogs with round (curved) corners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soft Close: Automatically close an active dialog window when a click/tap strikes outside the window area - e.g. Save, Open, Font, Options dialogs. This can speed up typical workflows by skipping the need to specifically click the OK or Cancel buttons to close the dialog. For instance, click "Options" to display the options dialog, change a few settings and click/tap outside the window to close it and save changes. Also convenient to cancel a dialog displayed by mistake/change of mind, such as a Save dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safe Area: Retains app window on screen at all times, and any sub windows or dialogs within the app. Any attempt to drag the app out-of-range triggers an automatic position correction - a passive system that continuously checks the window position and monitor size. Supports both single and multi-monitor modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Show Splash: Displays an informative/artistic splash screen on app startup. Unselect to disable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realtime Help: Scrolls control-centric help across the top of the current window, dialog, or menu. Hover mouse cursor over / tap finger on a control for related help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hints: Hover mouse over / tap finger on a control to display help related information in a popup bubble&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Touch: Comfortably enlarge controls and menus for touch access (finger taps)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double Clicks: Some options work best with a double click / tap for confirmation. This option supports the traditional double click mode. For example, navigating a disk drive using a double click / tap to switch between folders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Top: Set the app above all other apps and windows&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economy: Normal app operation can use a lot of paint cycles and CPU power, especially if it's rendering graphics and effects continuously on the screen. Economy mode throttles back this usage during periods of extended idleness, e.g. when there is no direct app keyboard input, or indirect mouse cursor movement or finger taps. For more specific information refer to the topic "Economy mode".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;32bit Graphics: Not noticeable on today's powerful computers with their 32 bit monitors and video cards, it however can deliver a small performance improvement on older computers running 24 bit graphics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frame Maximised: Show the app's frame whilst maximised. The frame is always hidden whilst in fullscreen mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safe Background: An optional static or animated background scheme can be set, which renders an image beneath the GUI. If this image is too bold / strong the GUI can be hard to view / use. By default this option limits the background strength to a safe maximum level of 100. Unselect this option to permit the full range of background strength (0-255). If the GUI becomes hard to use or unreadable, press the "F2" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-Monitor: Permit the app to span the full range of attached monitors when maximised or in fullscreen mode. By default the app spans the current monitor only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Center Title: Position the name of the app in the center of the app's window header&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toolbar Alignment: Align the content of all participating toolbars to the left, center, or to the right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Color Contrast: Color coordinate important system settings and options into color specific input panels for rapid visual identification&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monochromatic Images: Use high-contrast, color-adaptive, monochromatic tool images on the app's GUI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highlight Above: Retain highlight areas and other important GUI zones whilst a background scheme is in use&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brightness: Adjust the brightness of the entire app, from 60 being the darkest right up to 130 being the brightest. Any change takes affect immediately. The default brightness is 100.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfocused Opacity: Renders the app translucent upon loosing focus - e.g. when another app is in use. Available range is 30 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible. Default value is 255. This feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed: The speed by which to transition the app from a focused state to a non-focused state or vice-versa. Speed range is 1-10, where 1 is the slowest and 10 the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focused Opacity: Renders the app translucent upon gaining focus - e.g. when the user interacts with it. Available range is 50 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible. Default value is 255. As above, this feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor: Change the default cursor to one of the built-in cursors, each of which scale from small to large, according to the current size set by the operating system. A range of static colors are available: Red, Orange, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Aqua, Blue, Green, Grey, Black, White, along with Default and Custom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, two dynamically colored cursors are included: "Adaptive - Hover" and "Adaptive - Title". These special cursors acquire their color from the current color scheme. Any change to the color scheme is reflected in the color of the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The custom cursor option supports both static cursors ".cur" and animated cursor ".ani" file formats. To use, select the "Custom" option. The cursor will update if previously customised. To change the cursor, click the option again and select a cursor from file using the Open dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frame Sparkle: Applies a random texture to the app's frame. Select a value from 0 (off) to 20 (bold).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frame Size: Adjust the app's frame size (width in pixels) from 0 (none) to 72 (wide). The default frame size is typically 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scrollbar Size: Set the width and/or height of the app's scrollbars. A value of 5 (thin/short) to 72 (wide/tall) is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wine Compatibility: Wine is basically a large computer instruction conversion app, which allows an app designed for Microsoft Windows to execute its instructions "run" on another operating system, such as a Mac or Linux. Because Wine does not emulate / bridge any logic gaps and only translates an app's instructions, the underlying computer hardware must match that used by Microsoft Windows - namely Intel and AMD64.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A notable exception to this requirement is the modern-day Mac, e.g. Mac Mini, which runs an Intel emulator under the hood. This allows a Microsoft Windows app to run by the following sequence: App to Wine to Intel emulator to Apple hardware. Incredibly, this appears to be a very effective and rather efficient strategy, especially for our lightweight apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Wine's functionality is both wide and impressive, there is some functionality that falls short of Windows. The Wine Compatibility option compensates where possible for important shortcomings, such as volume handling, and allows the app to maintain functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default option is automatic and detects the presence of Wine based on the existence of drive "Z:\". For more information on Wine refer to their website www.winehq.org .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore Defaults: Easily reset the app's system settings, such as color, font size, zoom level etc to their defaults. Click the "Restore Defaults..." button at the bottom-right of the Options window or press the "F2" key at any time in the app to display the "Restore Defaults" confirmation prompt. Confirm your intention to reset and then click the "Restore Defaults" button. The app will reset to default values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An app typically has settings in addition to these which are not restored / reset. Instead, they should be adjusted via the app itself as required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶On Top - Position app above other apps and windowsClick the app menu button (top right) and tick "On Top" option. Alternatively, click "Options &amp;gt; Settings" and select "Display &amp;gt; On Top" option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Don't show the splash screen on app startBy default the splash screen is displayed with a momentarily pause on startup. This can be switched off by going to "Options &amp;gt; Settings" and deselecting the "Display &amp;gt; Show Splash" option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Where is my app? / Show the app folderBecause this app is portable, you might not remember / know where it is located on your hard disk or usb pen stick. To access its folder, click the app menu button (top right) and select " Show App Folder". An explorer window will display with the app's binary (*.exe) and storage folder listed alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Economy modeRunning an app at full speed when it's not being used can be a bit wasteful, and may prematurely drain the batteries on your laptop or tablet. Select this option to automatically throttle back battery / power consumption and CPU / graphic loads after a short idle period of 10 minutes. At which point the app will reduce its paint cycles down to 2 fps at a maximum. And a further reduction at 30 minutes to 1 fps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internal processing loads will typically be reduced also, lowering the demand on your CPU and batteries further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single stroke of the keyboard directed at the app, or a global mouse click, or tap of the finger will instantly disengage the current economy state and return the app back to full operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable, click "Options &amp;gt; Settings" and select "Display &amp;gt; Economy" option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Some technical limitations of this appThe Gossamer Code Foundation - our 4th generation codebase - which powers this app has been engineered with care and patience to a high level of quality and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As our code is rather unique and almost entirely custom built, there are some technical limitations which make our apps incompatible with some extended features of modern operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These limitations mainly concern the use of UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding of text, and more specifically filenames. At this stage the app works with the legacy Windows-1252 character encoding for both text processing and filenames. The app is therefore unable to handle foreign language text, or load and save files with special, foreign, or emoji characters in their filenames. All text and filenames are restricted to english ASCII characters in the Windows-1252 encoding standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, some options and minor operations may not work as expected, or at all on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows. Though an enormous amount of time and effort has gone into harmonising the look and feel, behaviour and reliability of the app across multiple flavours of Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems, it is not always possible to catch every failure point, or in some rare cases make it work properly, though we always endeavor to do our best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A side note, our codebase is still running well as 32 bit code in 2025. Yes, 32 bit! Some might see this as a limitation, but we see it as a flexible, inexpensive, and widely adopted execution pathway with support for many platforms and reuse / life extension of older equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶What makes a portable app special?A portable app is a big leap forward for apps in general. A standard or traditionally engineered app requires a lot of support in the form of libraries, data files, images, scripts, etc and the list goes on. You get the picture. Some portable apps out there still include this bundle of bits, they merely offload it into a local folder. A dump of goodies of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tend to see a portable app in quite a different light. Our vision of a portable app is designed tight, clean, free of bloat, and all data where possible is included directly within, structured right into the fabric of the app itself, and designed from the bare-metal up if required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the most important difference between a traditional app and a portable app is that a portable app will not install on your computer. This is extremely important as the installation process is often messy, and can clutter up your computer by dumping a lot of stuff all over the Windows file structure and registry, and over time may slow down and decrease the overall performance of your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A portable app will not do this, which keeps your computer clean and running smooth and fast as it should. Unfortunately most software is not designed with portable in mind. They're more akin to a large leaky box of bits than tight engineering. And because a portable app is not installed on your computer, it runs outside the normal scope of the operating system, and is not locked down or tied to it. And thus can be moved about, from disk to disk, or computer to computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically a portable app will reside on a USB pen stick, removable media, or in a special folder on a portable hard disk. This makes it easy to take from one computer to the next, and use over and over. An immensely valuable freedom, and something an installed app can only dream of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a serious technical hurdle must be overcome for a truly portable app to be free. And that is the humble setting. Yes, a portable app must be able to handle it's settings on it's own. It must be able to read them from disk, filter them, check and correct them where required, and write them back to disk. All without the help of the Windows' registry or other operating system dependent structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An installed app typically can't or won't do this. Instead, it relies on Windows and the registry to manage it's settings and other important data sets for it. It therefore takes a higher degree of technical competence to escape this "tied to the operating system" situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is our current standard for a portable app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Require no installation or setup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Require no additional DLL libraries to run and perform it's core function&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make no alteration to the host operating system, or its settings, files, libraries or core functions, or the Windows registry, unless it forms a part or a whole of the app's core function, and then, only when initiated by the user&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be able to run "out of the box"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Require no compiling, conversion, installation or setup of support structures in order to execute, except for when such an environment constitutes an execution enabling environment, such as a command translation service like Wine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be free of zipped or otherwise externally bundled blob structures containing folders, files and bits&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operate on less powerful hardware to facilitate operation on a broad spectrum of computers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less demanding API landscape to facilitate execution on a broad range of operating systems and software translation environments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Require no special software libraries be present in order to run, such as .NET or JAVA, unless typically pre-installed on the target operating system or execution environment&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not require an internet connection to run, unless the connection is required to fulfill the app's core function, such as a web server&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Require no downloads, addons, or registration in order to run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide help and documentation offline via a built-in viewer, or by limited external means, such as Notepad&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be self-contained with all necessary files, data sets, and samples stored within it's internal structure, such that access be provided preferably through direct enabling mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Store, hold and manage external app settings and user data in a local sub-folder, and that sub-folder be easily identifiable as belonging to the app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide a mostly consistent appearance and experience to the user across the widest possible range of operating systems and execution environments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value backwards compatibility, and be able to actively make use of that older hardware and software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possess a compact, bloat-free footprint&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶How to remove the app and what you should do firstMake sure any app related data that is precious to you is backed up before you delete. As a portable app does not install itself on your computer there will be no automatic uninstall option listed in Windows. The app must be removed manually. But this is not difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, ensure the options below are unselected before proceeding. Click "Options &amp;gt; Settings" and deselect: 1. Start button link 2. Desktop link 3. Automatic Startup link&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If these links are not removed they may linger due to the oddities of some versions of Windows and it's often complex nature and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this app is administered by a 3rd party system then that system should be used now to remove this app. If not, then click the app menu button "" (top right) and select " Show App Folder". An explorer window will display with the app's executable (*.exe) and storage folder listed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure any data precious to you has been backed up or moved out of the app's storage folder before proceeding. When you're ready, close the app and right click on it's EXE "&amp;lt;app name&amp;gt;.exe" and select the Delete option. If a prompt appears, confirm your intention to delete. Repeat for the storage folder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is now removed from your computer, USB pen stick, or hard disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⏶Help my app doesn't look right what should I do?If for some reason your app doesn't appear right, or you think you've turned on or off some important system setting but you're not sure which one or where, not too worry, you can restore the app's default settings in two easy steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 1: From anywhere in the app press the "F2" key to display the "Restore Defaults" confirmation window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 2: When you're sure you're ready to proceed, click the "Restore Defaults" button. The app will reset, restoring all key system settings to their safe defaults, this includes color, font size, zoom level etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don't have a keyboard, or the "F2" key is not available / difficult to access, you can click the "Options" link from the top toolbar to display the options window, then click the "Restore Defaults..." button (bottom right of window), and lastly confirm by pressing the "Restore Defaults" button. The app will reset / restore defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's another Monday morning, sitting down at the computer. And I see a stack of alerts from the last hour of packages showing signs of malware in our triage queue. Having not yet finished my first cup of coffee, I see Shai Hulud indicators. Yikes, surely that's a false positive? Nope, welcome to Monday, Shai Hulud struck again. Strap in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Timeline of the Shai-Hulud Campaign&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timing is notable, given npmâs recent announcement that it will revoke classic tokens on December 9 after the wave of supply-chain attacks. With many users still not migrated to trusted publishing, the attacker seized the moment for one more hit before npmâs deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;August 27 - We release our report detailing the S1ngularity campaign targeting several nx packages on npm. Â&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 16 - The attacker strikes again, launching the first wave of the Shai-Hulud attacks. Â&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 18 - We publish a follow-up analysis, diving deeper into the campaignâs technical quirks and early payload behavior. Â&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 24 - A second strike occurs, dubbed the âSecond Comingâ by the attackers, timed just before npmâs deadline for revoking old tokens.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Shai-Hulud?: A Quick Refresher&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shai-Hulud, named after the gigantic sandworms from Dune as part of the attacker's flair for theatrics, is a self-replicating npm worm built to spread quickly through compromised developer environments. Once it infects a system, it searches for exposed secrets such as API keys and tokens using TruffleHog and publishes anything it finds to a public GitHub repository. It then attempts to push new copies of itself to npm, helping it propagate across the ecosystem, while exfiltrating data back to the attacker. Keeping with the dramatic theme, the attacker refers to this latest wave as the âSecond Coming.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Differences from last time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time around, there are some significant differences in the attack:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It install bun with the file &lt;code&gt;setup_bun.js&lt;/code&gt;and then uses that to execute&lt;code&gt;bun_environment.js&lt;/code&gt;Â which is the actual malicious code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It creates a randomly named repository with stolen data, rather than a hardcoded name.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It will infect up to 100 npm packages, compared to 20 last time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it can't authenticate with GitHub or NPM, it will wipe all files in the users Home directory.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Which packages are affected?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've detected the following packages compromised with a new version of Shai Hulud. Between all these 492 packages, they have a total of 132 million monthly downloads:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As we've been analzying all these packages, we've noticed a number of compromised packages that appear to be from community spread, which contain the initial staging code in &lt;code&gt;setup_bun.js&lt;/code&gt;, but NOTÂ &lt;code&gt;bun_environment.js&lt;/code&gt; which is the ShaiÂ Hulud worm itself. Here's the code that spreads the worm into other packages:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We see that the &lt;code&gt;bun_environment.js&lt;/code&gt; may sometimes not be bundled, depending on different factors. It appears that mistakes were once again made by the attackers. This appears to have limited the imapct of the attack at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compromised GitHub repositories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AsyncAPIÂ team detected that there had been a branch of their CLIÂ project, which was created just prior to the malicious packages being pushed, which deployed a version of the ShaiÂ Hulud malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://github.com/asyncapi/cli/blob/2efa4dff59bc3d3cecdf897ccf178f99b115d63d/bun_environment.js&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests that the attackers may have used a similar technique to how they pulled off the original Nx compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Patient zero&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We detected the first packages starting at 11/24/2025 3:16:26 AM GMT+0, which were the packages go-template, and 36 packages from &lt;code&gt;AsyncAPI&lt;/code&gt;. Many more packages were quickly compromised. Afterwards, they started compromising PostHog packages at 11/24/2025 Â 4:11:55 AM GMT+0, and Postman packages at 11/24/2025 Â 5:09:25 AMÂ GMT+0.&lt;lb/&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Potential impact of Shai-Hulud: Second Coming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threat actors have slipped malicious code into hundreds of NPM packages â including major ones from Zapier, ENS, AsyncAPI, PostHog, Browserbase, and Postman. If a developer installs one of these bad packages, the malware quietly runs during installation, before anything even finishes installing. This gives it access to the developerâs machine, build systems, or cloud environment. It then uses an automated tool (TruffleHog) to search for sensitive information like passwords, API keys, cloud tokens, and GitHub or NPM credentials. Anything it finds is uploaded to a public GitHub repository labeled âSha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.â If those stolen secrets include access to code repositories or package registries, attackers can use them to break into more accounts and publish more malicious packages, helping the attack spread further. Because trusted ecosystems were involved and millions of downloads are affected, any team using NPM should immediately check whether they were impacted and rotate any credentials that may have leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;â&lt;lb/&gt;Which actions should security teams take?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit all Zapier/ENS-related npm dependencies and versions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotate all GitHub, npm, cloud, and CI/CD secrets used during installs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check GitHub for strange repos with the descriptionÂ âSha1-Hulud: The Second Comingâ&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disable npm &lt;code&gt;postinstall&lt;/code&gt;scripts in CI where possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pin package versions and enforce MFA on GitHub and npm accounts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use tools like Safe-Chain to block malicious packages on NPM&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;lb/&gt;Story developing... Stay tuned for updates. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corvus Robotics is scaling the largest autonomous logistics data capture fleet ever built. If you're allergic to leaded solder, actual revenue, spreadsheets, or ambiguity -- this role is not for you. More "cardboard boxes," less "Pelican cases."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our fleet of flying warehouse drones is 5x-ing in 2026, and I'm looking for a generalist ex-founder or manufacturing leader in the SF Bay Area who wants to get their hands dirty massively scaling manufacturing operations in the US and overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We need someone who has worked on hardware products (not just SaaS), communicates clearly, and is relentlessly resourceful. Mandarin proficiency and leading a product through EVT/DVT/PVT is an added bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If this resonates with you, DM me, or send a super short email to a@ our url with: - why you’re interested - what was the biggest manufacturing fuckup you've recovered from - your target comp&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;cool-retro-term is a terminal emulator which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens. It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses the QML port of qtermwidget (Konsole): https://github.com/Swordfish90/qmltermwidget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This terminal emulator works under Linux and macOS and requires Qt5. It's suggested that you stick to the latest LTS version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Settings such as colors, fonts, and effects can be accessed via context menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to get a hold of the latest version, just go to the Releases page and grab the latest AppImage (Linux) or dmg (macOS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, most distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch already package cool-retro-term in their official repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the wiki and follow the instructions on how to build it on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TSMC Arizona Outage Saw Fab Halt, Apple Wafers Scrapped&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;[Exclusive] Supply of industrial gases used for chipmaking was cut when power at a vendor's facilities was interrupted.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good Evening from Taipei,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A power outage at an industrial gas facility servicing TSMC interrupted manufacturing at the company’s Fab 21 in Arizona late last quarter, sources told me. The incident stopped the flow of crucial inputs needed for chipmaking, forcing the facility to shut down for at least a few hours, I was told. As a result, the company had to scrap thousands of wafers that were in production for clients at the site which include Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The event happened mid-September and was caused by a power fault at its outsourced vendor Linde, a British industrial gases and engineering company, my sources tell me. TSMC runs a lot of its own gas supply in Taiwan, but opted to contract the work out for its Arizona site. While mistakes happen, and insurance may cover some of the losses from the event, Linde has been put on notice to identify and rectify the cause of the outage, I was told. A PR representative for Linde didn’t answer multiple phone calls and emails from Culpium outlining the incident and requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s Arizona unit turned profitable in the first quarter of this year, a sign of the Taiwanese company’s ability to quickly scale up and churn out chips even in higher-cost locales like the US. But a 99% drop in net income in the third quarter to just $1.4 million had folks scratching their head. One writer was quick to jump to conclusions, with the assumption that “rising costs have taken out an enormous chunk of profits, putting pressure on the firm’s operations.” The September outage, which hasn’t previously been reported, offers an alternative explanation for the profit decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“TSMC Arizona has begun to positively contribute to TSMC’s revenue. However, the company’s profit is influenced by multiple factors and should be read over time,” TSMC wrote in response to a detailed account of what Culpium has been told about the outage. “We also stated before that the ramp up for our overseas fabs will lead to gross margin dilution in the next five years, starting from 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the company declined to immediately address the issue of the manufacturing disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fab shutdowns are unusual, at least for TSMC. With equipment so expensive, its factories are run 24/7. That means that an hour of idle time can cost millions of dollars. Compounding the financial effect of this incident was the fact that it occurred late in the quarter, leaving little room to make up for lost production before the quarter closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Profit margins on new facilities and at new nodes tend to be quite thin, even negative. In addition, TSMC has been ramping up capacity in Arizona and that capex gets reflected in depreciation costs even before the new equipment can start producing revenue. So it’s reasonable to see fluctuations in net income at the site. A halt in production and scrapping of wafers adds to the costs, dragging on earnings even if only slightly and briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact to clients is likely to be negligible, I was told, and the financial loss to TSMC may be covered by insurance. Capacity at Fab 21 is still quite small, and many products being made there have already been taped out and manufactured in Taiwan previously. In past disruptions, lost production and revenue was made up in the subsequent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the broader issue is that Taiwanese manufacturers are good at managing their operations when they handle it themselves, but still face struggles when they need to lean on non-Taiwanese firms at overseas facilities. The entire process of building the fab and installing equipment at Arizona has been an exercise in cross-cultural adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common cause of production interruptions at TSMC is Mother Nature. Earthquakes regularly rattle Taiwan, and fabs are built to withstand most of them. But sometimes a big tremor can trigger a safety shutdown, while really nasty temblors have caused actual damage. Beyond natural disasters, there’ve been few man-made shutdowns at TSMC because they’re pretty rigorous about operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of notable problems were both caused by vendors, not TSMC internally. In 2018, a computer virus was introduced to fabs via equipment from Japan. That incident sparked a whole new approach to cybersecurity both at TSMC and among fellow Taiwanese chipmakers. Less than a year later, a batch of contaminated photoresist from a chemical supplier forced the company to scrap a large number of wafers. It made up the production the following quarter, with the problem costing TSMC around $25 million in operating profit for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linde trumpeted the TSMC contract when it landed the deal back in 2021, noting that it planned to invest $600 million into the facility. “While the project is capital and electricity intensive, it will only employ 14 plant employees and 14 truck drivers, documents from 2020 said,” the Arizona Tech Council later reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s A16 SoC was the first product taped out at the site, Culpium reported in September last year. AMD’s Ryzen 9000 and Nvidia Blackwell chips were since added to the lineup with designs from Bitdeer, among others, also qualified at the Arizona fab.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Bitter Lesson of LLM Extensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, “using an LLM” meant pasting a wall of text into a chat box and hoping for something useful back. Today, we point agents at our codebases, our browsers, and let them go off and act on our behalf. A key question that has been brewing under the surface during this time has been: how do we let end users actually customize these systems?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As models have become more capable, the ways and mechanisms that end users have access to customize them have expanded as well. We've gone from simple system prompts to complex client-server protocols and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the history of LLM extension over the last three years and where I see it going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ChatGPT Plugins (March 2023)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just four months after launch, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Plugins. Looking back, these were wildly ahead of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea was ambitious: give the LLM a link to an OpenAPI spec and let it "run wild" calling REST endpoints. It was a direct line to AGI-style thinking: universal tool use via standard APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "name_for_human": "TODO Manager",
  "name_for_model": "todo_manager",
  "description_for_human": "Manages your TODOs!",
  "description_for_model": "An app for managing a user's TODOs",
  "api": { "url": "/openapi.json" },
  "auth": { "type": "none" },
  "logo_url": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "legal_info_url": "http://example.com",
  "contact_email": "hello@example.com"
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? The models weren't ready. GPT-3.5 (and even early GPT-4) struggled to navigate massive API specs without hallucinating or getting lost in context. Plus, the UX was clunky. You had to manually toggle plugins for every chat!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what that looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it gave us a glimpse of the future: The Code Interpreter plugin (later Advanced Data Analysis) became indispensable, foreshadowing the powerful sandboxed execution environments we use today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Custom Instructions (July 2023)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom instructions were the "smooth brain" counter-reaction to the complexity of plugins. I did a double take when writing this because I thought for sure this feature was released before plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was just a user-defined prompt appended to every chat. Simple. Obvious. Yet it solved a huge problem: repetitive context setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the spiritual ancestor to every &lt;code&gt;.cursorrules&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Custom GPTs (Nov 2023)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI repackaged instructions and tools into Custom GPTs. This was an attempt to "productize" prompt engineering. You could bundle a persona, some files, and a few actions into a shareable link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a retreat from the open-ended promise of plugins toward curated, single-purpose "apps."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory in ChatGPT (February 2024)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we've discussed manual ways to extend LLMs. Memory represented a shift toward automatic personalization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Memory records details from your conversations and quietly inserts them into future context. It's like a system prompt that writes itself. If you mention you're a vegetarian, it remembers that weeks later. It’s a small feature, but it marked the beginning of agents that maintain long-term state without user intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cursor Rules (April 2024)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor changed the game by putting custom instructions where they belonged: in the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.cursorrules&lt;/code&gt; file was a revelation. Instead of pasting context into a chat window, you committed it to git.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"We use tabs, not spaces."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"No semicolons."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Always use TypeScript."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as a single file, then evolved into a &lt;code&gt;.cursor/rules&lt;/code&gt; folder with sophisticated scoping. You could organize multiple rule files, and even define when they applied, for example, only for certain file types or subdirectories. It was the first time extension felt "native" to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later Cursor introduced the ability to let the LLM decide when to apply a rule, which is a pattern we will see again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Model Context Protocol (Nov 2024)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late 2024, models were finally smart enough to handle real tools reliably. Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) was the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MCP is a heavyweight solution. An MCP client needs to keep a persistent connection to an MCP server. The server serves up tool definitions, resources, and prompts to the client (in most cases is an agent) and it can send a message to the server saying a tool has been called and the server can respond with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Custom Instructions (which just add context), MCP gives the model actual capabilities. It can read your repo, query your Postgres DB, or deploy to Vercel. Besides just providing tools, it also allows servers to provide resources (documents, logs) and prompts directly to the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's powerful, and perhaps a bit of overkill. While the complexity might be worth it for agent developers asking a user to set up and connect an MCP is a lot of friction and there is an entire ecosystem of startups like Smithery built around making it easier to use MCP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that ChatGPT apps which were announced in October 2025 are built on top of MCP as a base layer. This is an attempt to make it easier for end users to use MCP without having to actually think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Claude Code: New Agent, New Extensions (Feb 2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early 2025 brought us Claude Code, which essentially added every extension mechanism under the sun to an agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;: The standard for repo-level instructions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP: For heavy-duty tool integration.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slash Commands: Like Cursor's notebooks, for reusable prompts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hooks: The ability to intercept and modify the agent's loop (e.g., "Stop if the tests fail").&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sub-agents: Spawning specialized workers to handle sub-tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Output Styles: (Deprecated) Configuring tone and format.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time will tell how many of these features will stick around in the long term. Anthropic has already tried to deprecate output styles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Agent Skills (Oct 2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next extension mechanism added to Claude Code is significant enough to warrant a deeper dive. Agent Skills are the rebirth of ChatGPT Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While MCP has a whole client-server protocol, Agent Skills are just folders of markdown files and scripts (in whatever language you choose).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent simply scans a &lt;code&gt;skills/&lt;/code&gt; directory, reads the frontmatter of every &lt;code&gt;SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt;, and builds a lightweight index. It then chooses to read the full contents of a skill only if it's appropriate for the current task. This solves one of the major problems with MCP: the context bloat that comes from having to load all of the tool definitions into the context window at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a snippet of the structure of a skill for doing e2e testing with Playwright taken from Anthropic's Skills examples repository:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;webapp-testing/
├── examples/
│   ├── console_logging.py
│   ├── element_discovery.py
│   └── static_html_automation.py
├── scripts/
│   └── with_server.py
└── SKILL.md
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a mix of scripts, examples, and plain text instructions. The only required file is the SKILL.md file. Let's take a look at that file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;---
name: webapp-testing
description: Toolkit for interacting with and testing local web applications using Playwright. Supports verifying frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, capturing browser screenshots, and viewing browser logs.

# Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

**Helper Scripts Available**:

- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is absolutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.

... skill continues ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a plain markdown file with some metadata and a description of the skill. The agent reads the file which freely references other files that the agent can read. In contrast a playwright MCP server has dozens of tool definitions to control a browser, this skill just says "you have bash, this is how you write a playwright script".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted to use a skill the agent needs to have general purpose access to a computer, but this is the bitter lesson in action. Giving an agent general purpose tools and trusting it to have the ability to use them to accomplish a task might very well be the winning strategy over making specialized tools for every task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the future holds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are the actualization of the dream that was set out by ChatGPT Plugins: just give the model instructions and some generic tools and trust it to do the glue work in-between. But I have a hypothesis that it might actually work now because the models are actually smart enough for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent skills work because it assumes the agent has the ability to write its own tools (via bash commands). You can just give it code snippets and ask the agent to figure out how to run them generically for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, I think that skills signal towards a new definition of what an agent really is. An agent isn't just a LLM in a while loop. It's an LLM in a while loop that has a computer strapped to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code is the piece of software that first made this click for me, but it is way too developer focused to be the final form. Other applications like Zo Computer try to package the llm and computer together into a single application, but I still think it still doesn't abstract the computer away enough from the end user. If I ask a coworker to do something, I don't need to see their entire file system, I just need to know that they have a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking forward into 2026 I expect more and more llm applications that we use will have a computer strapped to them in new and interesting ways, whether we know it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I could short MCP, I would, and I expect us to go back to extending our agents with the most accessible programming language: natural language.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the surface, the Superbox media streaming devices for sale at retailers like BestBuy and Walmart may seem like a steal: They offer unlimited access to more than 2,200 pay-per-view and streaming services like Netflix, ESPN and Hulu, all for a one-time fee of around $400. But security experts warn these TV boxes require intrusive software that forces the user’s network to relay Internet traffic for others, traffic that is often tied to cybercrime activity such as advertising fraud and account takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox bills itself as an affordable way for households to stream all of the television and movie content they could possibly want, without the hassle of monthly subscription fees — for a one-time payment of nearly $400.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Tired of confusing cable bills and hidden fees?,” Superbox’s website asks in a recent blog post titled, “Cheap Cable TV for Low Income: Watch TV, No Monthly Bills.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Real cheap cable TV for low income solutions does exist,” the blog continues. “This guide breaks down the best alternatives to stop overpaying, from free over-the-air options to one-time purchase devices that eliminate monthly bills.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox claims that watching a stream of movies, TV shows, and sporting events won’t violate U.S. copyright law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“SuperBox is just like any other Android TV box on the market, we can not control what software customers will use,” the company’s website maintains. “And you won’t encounter a law issue unless uploading, downloading, or broadcasting content to a large group.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is nothing illegal about the sale or use of the Superbox itself, which can be used strictly as a way to stream content at providers where users already have a paid subscription. But that is not why people are shelling out $400 for these machines. The only way to watch those 2,200+ channels for free with a Superbox is to install several apps made for the device that enable them to stream this content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox’s homepage includes a prominent message stating the company does “not sell access to or preinstall any apps that bypass paywalls or provide access to unauthorized content.” The company explains that they merely provide the hardware, while customers choose which apps to install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We only sell the hardware device,” the notice states. “Customers must use official apps and licensed services; unauthorized use may violate copyright law.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox is technically correct here, except for maybe the part about how customers must use official apps and licensed services: Before the Superbox can stream those thousands of channels, users must configure the device to update itself, and the first step involves ripping out Google’s official Play store and replacing it with something called the “App Store” or “Blue TV Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox does this because the device does not use the official Google-certified Android TV system, and its apps will not load otherwise. Only after the Google Play store has been supplanted by this unofficial App Store do the various movie and video streaming apps that are built specifically for the Superbox appear available for download (again, outside of Google’s app ecosystem).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts say while these Android streaming boxes generally do what they advertise — enabling buyers to stream video content that would normally require a paid subscription — the apps that enable the streaming also ensnare the user’s Internet connection in a distributed residential proxy network that uses the devices to relay traffic from others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashley is a senior solutions engineer at Censys, a cyber intelligence company that indexes Internet-connected devices, services and hosts. Ashley requested that only her first name be used in this story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent video interview, Ashley showed off several Superbox models that the Censys research team was studying in the malware lab — including one purchased off the shelf at BestBuy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m sure a lot of people are thinking, ‘Hey, how bad could it be if it’s for sale at the big box stores?'” she said. “But the more I looked, things got weirder and weirder.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashley said she found the Superbox devices immediately contacted a server at the Chinese instant messaging service Tencent QQ, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass IO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GET GRASSED&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also known as getgrass[.]io, Grass says it is “a decentralized network that allows users to earn rewards by sharing their unused Internet bandwidth with AI labs and other companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Buyers seek unused internet bandwidth to access a more diverse range of IP addresses, which enables them to see certain websites from a retail perspective,” the Grass website explains. “By utilizing your unused internet bandwidth, they can conduct market research, or perform tasks like web scraping to train AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reached via Twitter/X, Grass founder Andrej Radonjic told KrebsOnSecurity he’d never heard of a Superbox, and that Grass has no affiliation with the device maker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It looks like these boxes are distributing an unethical proxy network which people are using to try to take advantage of Grass,” Radonjic said. “The point of grass is to be an opt-in network. You download the grass app to monetize your unused bandwidth. There are tons of sketchy SDKs out there that hijack people’s bandwidth to help webscraping companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radonjic said Grass has implemented “a robust system to identify network abusers,” and that if it discovers anyone trying to misuse or circumvent its terms of service, the company takes steps to stop it and prevent those users from earning points or rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox’s parent company, Super Media Technology Company Ltd., lists its street address as a UPS store in Fountain Valley, Calif. The company did not respond to multiple inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to this teardown by behindmlm.com, a blog that covers multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, Grass’s compensation plan is built around “grass points,” which are earned through the use of the Grass app and through app usage by recruited affiliates. Affiliates can earn 5,000 grass points for clocking 100 hours usage of Grass’s app, but they must progress through ten affiliate tiers or ranks before they can redeem their grass points (presumably for some type of cryptocurrency). The 10th or “Titan” tier requires affiliates to accumulate a whopping 50 million grass points, or recruit at least 221 more affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radonjic said Grass’s system has changed in recent months, and confirmed the company has a referral program where users can earn Grass Uptime Points by contributing their own bandwidth and/or by inviting other users to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Users are not required to participate in the referral program to earn Grass Uptime Points or to receive Grass Tokens,” Radonjic said. “Grass is in the process of phasing out the referral program and has introduced an updated Grass Points model.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A review of the Terms and Conditions page for getgrass[.]io at the Wayback Machine shows Grass’s parent company has changed names at least five times in the course of its two-year existence. Searching the Wayback Machine on getgrass[.]io shows that in June 2023 Grass was owned by a company called Wynd Network. By March 2024, the owner was listed as Lower Tribeca Corp. in the Bahamas. By August 2024, Grass was controlled by a Half Space Labs Limited, and in November 2024 the company was owned by Grass OpCo (BVI) Ltd. Currently, the Grass website says its parent is just Grass OpCo Ltd (no BVI in the name).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radonjic acknowledged that Grass has undergone “a handful of corporate clean-ups over the last couple of years,” but described them as administrative changes that had no operational impact. “These reflect normal early-stage restructuring as the project moved from initial development…into the current structure under the Grass Foundation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;UNBOXING&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Censys’s Ashley said the phone home to China’s Tencent QQ instant messaging service was the first red flag with the Superbox devices she examined. She also discovered the streaming boxes included powerful network analysis and remote access tools, such as Tcpdump and Netcat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This thing DNS hijacked my router, did ARP poisoning to the point where things fall off the network so they can assume that IP, and attempted to bypass controls,” she said. “I have root on all of them now, and they actually have a folder called ‘secondstage.’ These devices also have Netcat and Tcpdump on them, and yet they are supposed to be streaming devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick online search shows various Superbox models and many similar Android streaming devices for sale at a wide range of top retail destinations, including Amazon, BestBuy, Newegg, and Walmart. Newegg.com, for example, currently lists more than three dozen Superbox models. In all cases, the products are sold by third-party merchants on these platforms, but in many instances the fulfillment comes from the e-commerce platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Newegg is pretty bad now with these devices,” Ashley said. “Ebay is the funniest, because they have Superbox in Spanish — the SuperCaja — which is very popular.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ashley said Amazon recently cracked down on Android streaming devices branded as Superbox, but that those listings can still be found under the more generic title “modem and router combo” (which may be slightly closer to the truth about the device’s behavior).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox doesn’t advertise its products in the conventional sense. Rather, it seems to rely on lesser-known influencers on places like Youtube and TikTok to promote the devices. Meanwhile, Ashley said, Superbox pays those influencers 50 percent of the value of each device they sell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s weird to me because influencer marketing usually caps compensation at 15 percent, and it means they don’t care about the money,” she said. “This is about building their network.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BADBOX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As plentiful as the Superbox is on e-commerce sites, it is just one brand in an ocean of no-name Android-based TV boxes available to consumers. While these devices generally do provide buyers with “free” streaming content, they also tend to include factory-installed malware or require the installation of third-party apps that engage the user’s Internet address in advertising fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants dubbed the “BadBox 2.0 Enterprise,” which Google described as a botnet of over ten million Android streaming devices that engaged in advertising fraud. Google said the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, can also infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several of the Android streaming devices flagged in Google’s lawsuit are still for sale on top U.S. retail sites. For example, searching for the “X88Pro 10” and the “T95” Android streaming boxes finds both continue to be peddled by Amazon sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malicious software prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors, usually during the set-up process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Once these compromised IoT devices are connected to home networks, the infected devices are susceptible to becoming part of the BADBOX 2.0 botnet and residential proxy services known to be used for malicious activity,” the FBI said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FBI said BADBOX 2.0 was discovered after the original BADBOX campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original BADBOX was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Riley Kilmer is founder of Spur, a company that tracks residential proxy networks. Kilmer said Badbox 2.0 was used as a distribution platform for IPidea, a China-based entity that is now the world’s largest residential proxy network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kilmer and others say IPidea is merely a rebrand of 911S5 Proxy, a China-based proxy provider sanctioned last year by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for operating a botnet that helped criminals steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs (the U.S. Department of Justice also arrested the alleged owner of 911S5).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are most IPidea customers using the proxy service? According to the proxy detection service Synthient, six of the top ten destinations for IPidea proxies involved traffic that has been linked to either ad fraud or credential stuffing (account takeover attempts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kilmer said companies like Grass are probably being truthful when they say that some of their customers are companies performing web scraping to train artificial intelligence efforts, because a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. By routing this unwelcome traffic through residential IP addresses, Kilmer said, content scraping firms can make it far trickier to filter out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,” Kilmer told KrebsOnSecurity. “Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Products like Superbox are drawing increased interest from consumers as more popular network television shows and sportscasts migrate to subscription streaming services, and as people begin to realize they’re spending as much or more on streaming services than they previously paid for cable or satellite TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These streaming devices from no-name technology vendors are another example of the maxim, “If something is free, you are the product,” meaning the company is making money by selling access to and/or information about its users and their data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox owners might counter, “Free? I paid $400 for that device!” But remember: Just because you paid a lot for something doesn’t mean you are done paying for it, or that somehow you are the only one who might be worse off from the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may be that many Superbox customers don’t care if someone uses their Internet connection to tunnel traffic for ad fraud and account takeovers; for them, it beats paying for multiple streaming services each month. My guess, however, is that quite a few people who buy (or are gifted) these products have little understanding of the bargain they’re making when they plug them into an Internet router.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superbox performs some serious linguistic gymnastics to claim its products don’t violate copyright laws, and that its customers alone are responsible for understanding and observing any local laws on the matter. However, buyer beware: If you’re a resident of the United States, you should know that using these devices for unauthorized streaming violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and can incur legal action, fines, and potential warnings and/or suspension of service by your Internet service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the FBI, there are several signs to look for that may indicate a streaming device you own is malicious, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-The presence of suspicious marketplaces where apps are downloaded.&lt;lb/&gt; -Requiring Google Play Protect settings to be disabled.&lt;lb/&gt; -Generic TV streaming devices advertised as unlocked or capable of accessing free content.&lt;lb/&gt; -IoT devices advertised from unrecognizable brands.&lt;lb/&gt; -Android devices that are not Play Protect certified.&lt;lb/&gt; -Unexplained or suspicious Internet traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explainer from the Electronic Frontier Foundation delves a bit deeper into each of the potential symptoms listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GrapheneOS migrates server infrastructure from France amid police intimidation claims&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GrapheneOS project has announced on X that they are ceasing all operations in France, asserting that the country is no longer safe for "open source privacy projects".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the operating system will still be available to French users, all website and discussion servers are being relocated abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, the project relied on OVH Bearharnois, a French hosting provider, for its core website and social media services. The migration plan moves the Mastodon, Discourse, and Matrix instances to a combination of local and shared servers in Toronto. Critical website infrastructure will be hosted by Netcup, a German‑based company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS claims that they does not collect confidential user data in their servers or store critical infrastructure in France. Therefore, the migration does not affect services such as signature verification and downgrade protection for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Citing the government's support of the European Union Chat Control proposal, GrapheneOS developers are also refusing travel to France. Developers are no longer allowed to work inside the country due to safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This decision was sparked by negative press coverage from two articles published by Le Parisien. An interview with French cybercrime prosecutor Johanna Brousse implies potential legal action against the project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"With this new tool, there is real legitimacy for a certain portion of users in the desire to protect their exchanges. The approach is therefore different. But that won't stop us from suing the publishers if links are discovered with a criminal organization and they don't cooperate with the law"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS argues that Le Parisien have conflated their project with government-sponsored forks, which are fake copies of their operating system. The news outlet refers to a fake Snapchat app, dark web advertising, and a series of unlisted YouTube videos that are not features of GrapheneOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project had previously threatened litigation against these government-sponsored forks. One prominent example is ANOM, an FBI-backed shell company that developed a compromised Android operating system and messaging platform as part of Operation Trojan Horse from 2018 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google's new 'Aluminium OS' project brings Android to PC: Here's what we know&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20 minutes ago&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Android operating system is incredibly versatile. Beyond smartphones, it officially powers tablets, watches, TVs, cars, and XR headsets. However, it has virtually no presence on traditional PCs, where Google instead relies on ChromeOS. Despite Google’s efforts to challenge the dominance of Windows and macOS, ChromeOS remains a distant third. To close this gap, the company is unifying ChromeOS and Android into a single desktop platform, codenamed ‘Aluminium OS.’ Here’s what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Android on PCs: The story so far&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One year ago, Android Authority exclusively revealed Google’s plan to rally behind Android as its unified desktop OS. Our source indicated that this shift aims to create products that better compete with the iPad while making more effective use of development resources. In July, a Google executive confirmed part of our reporting, revealing that the company intends to merge ChromeOS and Android into a single platform. Finally, at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit in September, Google officially announced it is bringing Android to the PC market. The company stated it is collaborating with Qualcomm to build a new platform that converges mobile and desktop computing, leveraging recent advancements in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While we now know Google is building Android for PCs, there are still many unknown details. Is Google retiring the ChromeOS brand? Will existing Chromebooks receive the new operating system, or will they be left behind? Will this OS arrive only on budget machines, or target premium PCs as well? What will the interface actually look like, and what new features can we expect?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the burning questions as Google continues developing the platform. We likely won’t have all the answers until we get closer to launch, but thanks to job listings and bug reports, we’ve uncovered early details that offer some clues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Aluminium OS: Google’s PC ambitions take shape&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, a tipster on Telegram named Frost Core shared a link to an intriguing Google job listing for a ‘Senior Product Manager, Android, Laptop and Tablets.’ While we already know Google is bringing Android to the PC, the listing explicitly states that the role involves ‘working on a new Aluminium, Android-based, operating system.’ This effectively confirms that Aluminium is the codename for the new unified platform. The name appears to be a nod to the project’s roots: like Chromium (the open-source version of ChromeOS), Aluminium is a metal ending in ‘-ium.’ The choice of the British spelling — emphasizing the ‘Al’ prefix — likely pays homage to Android serving as the project’s foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much like Android XR, Google says its new Aluminium OS is ‘built with artificial intelligence (AI) at the core.’ This implies deep integration with Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot and large language model (LLM). At the Snapdragon Summit, Rick Osterloh, Google’s SVP of Devices and Services, outlined the company’s plans to bring its AI stack to PCs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“This is another way we can leverage all of the great work we’re doing together on our AI stack, our full stack, bringing Gemini models, bringing the assistant, bringing all of our applications and developer community into the PC domain. And I think this is another way in which Android is gonna be able to serve everyone in every computing category.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have yet to see exactly what new features Gemini will enable on Android PCs, but we hope the OS will fully leverage the hardware’s potential. On select premium smartphones, Gemini already powers an array of on-device AI features that demand significant memory and processing power from the CPU, GPU, and NPU. There were concerns that Google might restrict this new OS to the same budget-friendly niche where Chromebooks currently excel, ceding the high-end market to Microsoft and Apple. However, the job listing dispels those fears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new Senior Product Manager role is tasked with “driving the roadmap and curating a portfolio of ChromeOS and Aluminium Operating System (ALOS) Commercial devices across all form factors (e.g. laptops, detachables, tablets, and boxes) and tiers (e.g., Chromebook, Chromebook Plus, AL Entry, AL Mass Premium, and AL Premium) that meets the needs of users and the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This confirms that Android won’t be limited to laptops; the roadmap explicitly includes detachables, tablets, and ‘boxes’ (likely mini-PCs akin to the Chromebox or Mac Mini). Furthermore, the tiered structure — listing ‘AL Mass Premium’ and ‘AL Premium’ alongside ‘AL Entry’ — indicates that Google intends to push Android beyond budget PC hardware. While exact pricing for these tiers is hard to predict, it is clear Google aims to compete across the entire spectrum — a strategy foreshadowed by the recent Chromebook Plus initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of Chromebooks, the job listing also raises questions about the future of ChromeOS. The listing notes that the person will help “drive ChromeOS and Aluminium (e.g., Android) platforms and devices,” creating a roadmap and product portfolio that encompasses both. This implies the two platforms will coexist for some time. However, the person is also explicitly tasked with developing a strategy for transitioning “Google from ChromeOS to Aluminium with business continuity in the future.” This confirms that Google aims to eventually replace ChromeOS entirely — a move that must be managed carefully to avoid disrupting enterprise customers. This transition will likely require a multi-pronged approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Legacy Support: Existing ChromeOS devices that cannot be migrated to Aluminium OS will likely receive updates until they reach their end-of-life. This means Google will need to maintain the legacy ChromiumOS codebase for several more years.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional Migration: Rather than forcing an immediate switch, Google may offer an optional upgrade path for capable hardware. The company is currently testing Aluminium OS on development boards featuring MediaTek Kompanio 520 and 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake processors, so existing Chromebooks with these chips could be eligible for the update. However, migrating an operating system on live hardware is a massive technical hurdle that will require meticulous execution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, there will be new PCs launching with Aluminium OS out of the box as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is ChromeOS dead as we know it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if Google replaces the entire foundation of ChromeOS with Android, the company may be reluctant to abandon the name. While it lacks the market share of Windows or macOS, the ChromeOS brand is widely recognized, particularly in the education and enterprise sectors. Although the job listing doesn’t confirm the final naming scheme, bug reports spotted by Frost Core hint that Google may retain the branding. Engineers have referred to the current platform as “ChromeOS Classic” and “non-Aluminium ChromeOS,” implying the new Android-based version could simply usurp the name “ChromeOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, Google might adopt “Android Desktop” as the name to align with its renewed focus on promoting Android as a brand. However, “Android Desktop” could merely be an internal designation for the form factor. Since these references have only appeared in bug reports, the final marketing name remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When will Android on PCs launch?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google is actively developing the platform, with bug reports confirming that the company is testing fresh builds of Android 16 on development hardware. The company has confirmed the project will launch in 2026, though it remains unclear whether it will arrive in the first or second half of the year. Given this timeline, it is highly likely that the initial public release will be built upon Android 17, which is due next year. We will continue to monitor the project to find further details ahead of its official debut.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Watch Software Is Now 100% Open Source + Tick Talk #4 - PT2 Demos!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[2025-11-24]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another big Pebble update today! TLDR:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Pebble watch software was ~95% open source. Today, it’s 100% open source. You can download, compile and run all the software you need to use your Pebble. We just published the source code for the new Pebble mobile app!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Appstore now has a publicly available backup and supports multiple feeds, providing long term reliability through decentralization. We’ve launched our own feed and Developer Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Time 2 schedule update (aiming to begin shipping in January, with most arriving on wrists in March/April)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, and especially in the last week, I've chatted with tons of people in the Pebble community. One of the main questions people have is ‘how do I know that my new Pebble watch will continue to work long into the future?’. It’s an extremely valid question and concern - one that I share as a fellow Pebble wearer. I called this out specifically in my blog post announcing the relaunch in January 2025. How is this time round going to be different from last time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two pieces to making Pebble sustainable long term - hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing lasts forever, especially an inexpensive gadget like a Pebble. We want to be able to keep manufacturing these watches long into the future - mostly because I will always want one on my wrist! The company I set up to relaunch Pebble, Core Devices, is self funded, built without investors, and extremely lean. As long as we stay profitable (ie we don’t lose money), we will continue to manufacture new watches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also making sure that our new watches are more repairable than old Pebble watches. The back cover of Pebble Time 2 is screwed in. You can remove the back cover and replace the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve also published electrical and mechanical design files for Pebble 2 Duo. Yes, you can download the schematic (includes KiCad project files) right now on Github! This should give you a nice jumpstart to designing your own PebbleOS-compatible device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last time round, barely any of the Pebble software was open source. This made it very hard for the Pebble community to make improvements to their watches after the company behind Pebble shut down. Things are different now! This whole relaunch came about primarily because Google open sourced PebbleOS (thank you!). Yesterday, the software that powers Pebble watches was around 95% open source. As of today, it’s now 100%. This means that if Core Devices were to disappear into a black hole, you have all the source code you need to build, run and improve the software behind your Pebble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I confess that I misunderstood why 95% was much less sustainable than 100% until recently. I discuss this in more detail in my latest Tick Talk episode (check it out). Long story short - I’m an Android user and was happy to sideload the old Pebble APK on my phone, but iPhone and other Android users have basically been stuck without an easily available Pebble mobile companion app for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making sure the 3 main Pebble software components are open source and guaranteed to work long into the future:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PebbleOS - software that runs on your watch itself. This has been 100% open source since January and we’ve committed to open sourcing all the improvements we’ve made → github.com/coredevices/PebbleOS. You can download the source code, compile PebbleOS and easily install it over Bluetooth on your new Pebble. Textbook definition of open source!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble mobile companion app - the app that for your iPhone or Android. Without the app, your Pebble is basically a paperweight. When the Pebble Tech Corp died, the lack of an open source mobile app made it difficult for anyone to continue to use their watches. We had to build an entirely new app (get it here). Today, our app is now 100% open source on Github- ensuring that what happened before cannot happen again. Want to learn more about how we built the new app cross platform using Kotlin Multiplatform? Watch Steve’s presentation at Droidcon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developer tools and Pebble Appstore - this software enables people to build and share their watchapps and watchfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of dev tools, just being open source is not enough. They needed to be updated to work on modern computers. Before we made improvements, the state of the art of Pebble app development was using an Ubuntu virtualbox VM with Python2! Over the summer, our incredibly productive intern upgraded all the SDK and dev tools and created a new way to develop Pebble apps in the browser. You should check them out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there’s the Pebble Appstore. This is a collection of nearly 15,000 watchfaces and watchapps that you - the Pebble community - developed between 2012 and July 2018. When Fitbit pulled the plug on the original Pebble Appstore, the Rebble Foundation downloaded a copy of all the apps and faces, and set up a new web service to let users of the old Pebble app continue to download and use watchfaces. This was an incredible effort, one that I have used thousands of times and am a happy paying subscriber. But it’s still centralized - if their server disappears, there is no freely available backup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compensate for that, today we’re launching two new things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pebble mobile app will soon (later this week) be able to subscribe to multiple appstore ‘feeds’. This is similar to open source package managers like pip, AUR, APT, etc. Anyone can create a Pebble-compatible appstore feed and users will be able to browse apps from that feed in the Pebble mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve created our own Pebble Appstore feed (appstore-api.repebble.com) and new Developer Dashboard. Our feed (fyi powered by 100% new software) is configured to back up an archive of all apps and faces to Archive.org (backup will gradually complete over the next week). Today, our feed only has a subset of all Pebble watchfaces and apps (thank you aveao for creating Pebble Archive!). Developers - you can upload your existing or new apps right now! We hope that this sets a standard for openness and we encourage all feeds to publish a freely and publicly available archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important to note - developers will still be able to charge money for their apps and faces, using Kiezel pay or other services. This change does not preclude them from doing that, in fact it makes it even easier - I could see some developers creating a paid-only feed. As I recently wrote, we're also working on other ways for Pebble developers to earn money by publishing fun, beautiful and creative Pebble apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another important note - some binary blobs and other non-free software components are used today in PebbleOS and the Pebble mobile app (ex: the heart rate sensor on PT2 , Memfault library, and others). Optional non-free web services, like Wispr-flow API speech recognizer, are also used. These non-free software components are not required - you can compile and run Pebble watch software without them. This will always be the case. More non-free software components may appear in our software in the future. The core Pebble watch software stack (everything you need to use your Pebble watch) will always be open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-production Pebble Time 2. These watches are not final quality! We are still tweaking and tuning everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PT2 Schedule Update&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re currently in the middle of Pebble Time 2 design verification test (DVT) phase. After we finish that, we go into production verification test (PVT) and then mass production (MP). So far, things are proceeding according to the schedule update I shared last month but that is extraordinarily subject to change. We still have a lot of testing (especially waterproof and environmental) to go. If we find problems (which is likely) we will push the schedule back to make improvements to the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one major complicating factor is the timing of Chinese New Year (CNY). It’s early next year - factories will shut down for 3 weeks starting around the end of January. After restarting, things always take a week or two to get back to full speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are trying our best to get into mass production and ship out at most several thousand Pebble Time 2s before CNY. It’s going to be very tight 🤞. More likely is that production will begin after CNY, then we need to transfer the watches to our fulfillment center, and ship them out. Realistically, at this time we’re forecasting that the majority of people will receive their PT2 in March and April. Please keep in mind that things may still change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking a PT2 colour&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will be 4 colour options for PT2 - black/black, black/red, silver/blue, silver/(white or dark gray, still TBD). Let me be very clear - no one has picked a colour yet 😃. In a few weeks, I will send out an email asking everyone who pre-ordered a Pebble Time 2 to select which colour they would like to receive. Please do not email us asking when this email will be sent out. No one has been invited yet to do this. I will post here after all emails have gone out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a related note, I am extremely happy that we built and shipped Pebble 2 Duo. Not only is it an awesome watch, it was also a phenomenal way for us to exercise our production muscles and ease back into the systematic flow of building and shipping smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A video is worth a million words - so I encourage you to watch me demo Pebble Time 2 watches I just received this week. Keep in mind these watches are PRE-PRODUCTION which means they parts have imperfect qualities! Subject to change!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The video below opens to the part of the video where I do the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our newest model, Claude Opus 4.5, is available today. It’s intelligent, efficient, and the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use. It’s also meaningfully better at everyday tasks like deep research and working with slides and spreadsheets. Opus 4.5 is a step forward in what AI systems can do, and a preview of larger changes to how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is state-of-the-art on tests of real-world software engineering:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.5 is available today on our apps, our API, and on all three major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, simply use &lt;code&gt;claude-opus-4-5-20251101&lt;/code&gt; via the Claude API. Pricing is now $5/$25 per million tokens—making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams, and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Opus, we’re releasing updates to the Claude Developer Platform, Claude Code, and our consumer apps. There are new tools for longer-running agents and new ways to use Claude in Excel, Chrome, and on desktop. In the Claude apps, lengthy conversations no longer hit a wall. See our product-focused section below for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First impressions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our Anthropic colleagues tested the model before release, we heard remarkably consistent feedback. Testers noted that Claude Opus 4.5 handles ambiguity and reasons about tradeoffs without hand-holding. They told us that, when pointed at a complex, multi-system bug, Opus 4.5 figures out the fix. They said that tasks that were near-impossible for Sonnet 4.5 just a few weeks ago are now within reach. Overall, our testers told us that Opus 4.5 just “gets it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our customers with early access have had similar experiences. Here are some examples of what they told us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Opus models have always been “the real SOTA” but have been cost prohibitive in the past. Claude Opus 4.5 is now at a price point where it can be your go-to model for most tasks. It’s the clear winner and exhibits the best frontier task planning and tool calling we’ve seen yet.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivers high-quality code and excels at powering heavy-duty agentic workflows with GitHub Copilot. Early testing shows it surpasses internal coding benchmarks while cutting token usage in half, and is especially well-suited for tasks like code migration and code refactoring.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 beats Sonnet 4.5 and competition on our internal benchmarks, using fewer tokens to solve the same problems. At scale, that efficiency compounds.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivers frontier reasoning within Lovable's chat mode, where users plan and iterate on projects. Its reasoning depth transforms planning—and great planning makes code generation even better.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 excels at long-horizon, autonomous tasks, especially those that require sustained reasoning and multi-step execution. In our evaluations it handled complex workflows with fewer dead-ends. On Terminal Bench it delivered a 15% improvement over Sonnet 4.5, a meaningful gain that becomes especially clear when using Warp’s Planning Mode.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art results for complex enterprise tasks on our benchmarks, outperforming previous models on multi-step reasoning tasks that combine information retrieval, tool use, and deep analysis.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivers measurable gains where it matters most: stronger results on our hardest evaluations and consistent performance through 30-minute autonomous coding sessions.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 represents a breakthrough in self-improving AI agents. For office automation, our agents were able to autonomously refine their own capabilities—achieving peak performance in 4 iterations while other models couldn’t match that quality after 10.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is a notable improvement over the prior Claude models inside Cursor, with improved pricing and intelligence on difficult coding tasks.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is yet another example of Anthropic pushing the frontier of general intelligence. It performs exceedingly well across difficult coding tasks, showcasing long-term goal-directed behavior.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivered an impressive refactor spanning two codebases and three coordinated agents. It was very thorough, helping develop a robust plan, handling the details and fixing tests. A clear step forward from Sonnet 4.5.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 handles long-horizon coding tasks more efficiently than any model we’ve tested. It achieves higher pass rates on held-out tests while using up to 65% fewer tokens, giving developers real cost control without sacrificing quality.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;We’ve found that Opus 4.5 excels at interpreting what users actually want, producing shareable content on the first try. Combined with its speed, token efficiency, and surprisingly low cost, it’s the first time we’re making Opus available in Notion Agent.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 excels at long-context storytelling, generating 10-15 page chapters with strong organization and consistency. It's unlocked use cases we couldn't reliably deliver before.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 sets a new standard for Excel automation and financial modeling. Accuracy on our internal evals improved 20%, efficiency rose 15%, and complex tasks that once seemed out of reach became achievable.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is the only model that nails some of our hardest 3D visualizations. Polished design, tasteful UX, and excellent planning &amp;amp; orchestration - all with more efficient token usage. Tasks that took previous models 2 hours now take thirty minutes.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 catches more issues in code reviews without sacrificing precision. For production code review at scale, that reliability matters.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Based on testing with Junie, our coding agent, Claude Opus 4.5 outperforms Sonnet 4.5 across all benchmarks. It requires fewer steps to solve tasks and uses fewer tokens as a result. This indicates that the new model is more precise and follows instructions more effectively — a direction we’re very excited about.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The effort parameter is brilliant. Claude Opus 4.5 feels dynamic rather than overthinking, and at lower effort delivers the same quality we need while being dramatically more efficient. That control is exactly what our SQL workflows demand.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;We’re seeing 50% to 75% reductions in both tool calling errors and build/lint errors with Claude Opus 4.5. It consistently finishes complex tasks in fewer iterations with more reliable execution.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluating Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We give prospective performance engineering candidates a notoriously difficult take-home exam. We also test new models on this exam as an internal benchmark. Within our prescribed 2-hour time limit, Claude Opus 4.5 scored higher than any human candidate ever1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The take-home test is designed to assess technical ability and judgment under time pressure. It doesn’t test for other crucial skills candidates may possess, like collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years. But this result—where an AI model outperforms strong candidates on important technical skills—raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession. Our Societal Impacts and Economic Futures research is aimed at understanding these kinds of changes across many fields. We plan to share more results soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software engineering isn’t the only area on which Claude Opus 4.5 has improved. Capabilities are higher across the board—Opus 4.5 has better vision, reasoning, and mathematics skills than its predecessors, and it is state-of-the-art in many domains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s capabilities outpace some of the benchmarks we use in our tests. A common benchmark for agentic capabilities is τ2-bench, which measures the performance of agents in real-world, multi-turn tasks. In one scenario, models have to act as an airline service agent helping a distressed customer. The benchmark expects models to refuse a modification to a basic economy booking since the airline doesn’t allow changes to that class of tickets. Instead, Opus 4.5 found an insightful (and legitimate) way to solve the problem: upgrade the cabin first, then modify the flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Let me think about what options I have within my policy:

1. Modify flights - Basic economy cannot be modified. This is clear in the policy.
2. Change cabin - Wait, let me check this option! The policy says:
"In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights."

But he wants to change the flights, not just the cabin. However, what if we:
- Change the cabin first (which IS allowed for basic economy), then
- Change the flights (which is allowed for non-basic economy)

So the strategy could be:
1. Upgrade his cabin from basic economy to economy (or business)

This would cost more money, but it’s a legitimate path within the policy!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark technically scored this as a failure because Claude’s way of helping the customer was unanticipated. But this kind of creative problem solving is exactly what we’ve heard about from our testers and customers—it’s what makes Claude Opus 4.5 feel like a meaningful step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other contexts, finding clever paths around intended constraints could count as reward hacking—where models “game” rules or objectives in unintended ways. Preventing such misalignment is one of the objectives of our safety testing, discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A step forward on safety&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we state in our system card, Claude Opus 4.5 is the most robustly aligned model we have released to date and, we suspect, the best-aligned frontier model by any developer. It continues our trend towards safer and more secure models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our customers often use Claude for critical tasks. They want to be assured that, in the face of malicious attacks by hackers and cybercriminals, Claude has the training and the “street smarts” to avoid trouble. With Opus 4.5, we’ve made substantial progress in robustness against prompt injection attacks, which smuggle in deceptive instructions to fool the model into harmful behavior. Opus 4.5 is harder to trick with prompt injection than any other frontier model in the industry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find a detailed description of all our capability and safety evaluations in the Claude Opus 4.5 system card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New on the Claude Developer Platform&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As models get smarter, they can solve problems in fewer steps: less backtracking, less redundant exploration, less verbose reasoning. Claude Opus 4.5 uses dramatically fewer tokens than its predecessors to reach similar or better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But different tasks call for different tradeoffs. Sometimes developers want a model to keep thinking about a problem; sometimes they want something more nimble. With our new effort parameter on the Claude API, you can decide to minimize time and spend or maximize capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set to a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5’s best score on SWE-bench Verified, but uses 76% fewer output tokens. At its highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points—while using 48% fewer tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With effort control, context compaction, and advanced tool use, Claude Opus 4.5 runs longer, does more, and requires less intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our context management and memory capabilities can dramatically boost performance on agentic tasks. Opus 4.5 is also very effective at managing a team of subagents, enabling the construction of complex, well-coordinated multi-agent systems. In our testing, the combination of all these techniques boosted Opus 4.5’s performance on a deep research evaluation by almost 15 percentage points3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re making our Developer Platform more composable over time. We want to give you the building blocks to construct exactly what you need, with full control over efficiency, tool use, and context management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product updates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Products like Claude Code show what’s possible when the kinds of upgrades we’ve made to the Claude Developer Platform come together. Claude Code gains two upgrades with Opus 4.5. Plan Mode now builds more precise plans and executes more thoroughly—Claude asks clarifying questions upfront, then builds a user-editable plan.md file before executing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Code is also now available in our desktop app, letting you run multiple local and remote sessions in parallel: perhaps one agent fixes bugs, another researches GitHub, and a third updates docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Claude app users, long conversations no longer hit a wall—Claude automatically summarizes earlier context as needed, so you can keep the chat going. Claude for Chrome, which lets Claude handle tasks across your browser tabs, is now available to all Max users. We announced Claude for Excel in October, and as of today we've expanded beta access to all Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Each of these updates takes advantage of Claude Opus 4.5’s market-leading performance in using computers, spreadsheets, and handling long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Claude and Claude Code users with access to Opus 4.5, we’ve removed Opus-specific caps. For Max and Team Premium users, we’ve increased overall usage limits, meaning you’ll have roughly the same number of Opus tokens as you previously had with Sonnet. We’re updating usage limits to make sure you’re able to use Opus 4.5 for daily work. These limits are specific to Opus 4.5. As future models surpass it, we expect to update limits as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;1: This result was using parallel test-time compute, a method that aggregates multiple “tries” from the model and selects from among them. Without a time limit, the model (used within Claude Code) matched the best-ever human candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2: Note that these evaluations were run on an in-progress upgrade to Petri, our open-source, automated evaluation tool. They were run on an earlier snapshot of Claude Opus 4.5. Evaluations of the final production model show a very similar pattern of results when compared to other Claude models, and are described in detail in the Claude Opus 4.5 system card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3: A fetch-enabled version of BrowseComp-Plus. Specifically, the improvement was from 70.48% without using the combination of techniques to 85.30% using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All evals were run with a 64K thinking budget, interleaved scratchpads, 200K context window, default effort (high), and default sampling settings (temperature, top_p). Exceptions: SWE-bench Verified (no thinking budget) and Terminal Bench (128K thinking budget).
