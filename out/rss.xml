  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1998 Looking Glass Studios released the stealth game Thief: The Dark Project. This was just as 3D hardware acceleration was taking off, so due to the development cycle it didn't use hardware acceleration; it was a purely software-rendered game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was the primary author of the core rendering technology in Thief (although I didn't write the object or character renderers), as well as some related bits and pieces. The same rendering engine, modified by others to use 3D hardware acceleration, also did the rendering for System Shock 2 and Thief 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engine was written somewhat contemporaneously with Quake (despite the game being released much later), and the basic appearance strongly resembles Quake. Many of its technologies were copied from or inspired by Quake, but in many cases the way it works is slightly or significantly different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Quake software rendering was thoroughly documented by Michael Abrash in a series of articles which were reprinted in his Graphics Programming Black Book. The techniques used in Thief were never written up and I thought it might be nice to write them down for once, even if they're now totally irrelevant. I'll try to describe them relative to the probably-more-familiar Quake approaches where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important contemporaneous games with similar rendering technology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking Glass games previous to Thief had used grid-based worlds. System Shock 1 and the Ultima Underworlds computed visibility using a grid-based traversal. Thief, however, was totally free-form, so I had to start from scratch to design the Thief engine (which started long before Thief, and I imagine even before we shipped Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri, which I worked on).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief was based on the portal-and-cell idea for visibility and occlusion published by Seth Teller in his 1992 PhD dissertation. In fact, the Thief world renderer was called "Portal", but since that name has a newer popular meaning I'll just call it "Thief" or "the Thief engine" (but there was far far more to the Thief engine than just the renderer, such as the object system, AI, physics, and I had nothing to do with them; I didn't write "the Thief engine", just the renderer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was originally exploring this idea as research for an imagined holy grail for Looking Glass: developing an "indoor-outdoor" CRPG, since the previous LGS CRPGs (Ultima Underworld 1 &amp;amp; 2, System Shock 1) had all been "indoor" dungeons, but we also had this outdoor tech for Terra Nova, and many of us felt we'd want to eventually make a hypothetical Underworld 3 or something which would have dungeons and exteriors and buildings and what not (this was before Daggerfall). In trying to imagine how we could put some kind of a hole in the Terra Nova terrain to incorporate dungeons, I realized that portals could be used to seamlessly integrate multiple independent renderers (like an indoor renderer and an outdoor renderer) by putting portals at the boundaries, so I wrote up a long document over one Christmas vacation documenting my thoughts along those lines. Then I guess I had all these ideas bouncing around in my head, and I knew we didn't have any idea how to do non-grid stuff, and it seemed viable to just try to make a full indoor renderer using portals... so I went ahead and tackled implementing one as research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The portal-and-cell idea was used offline by Quake for computing its precomputed PVS ("potentially visible set")--also described in Seth Teller's dissertation--but Thief used it at runtime; Thief precomputed the portals and cells, but didn't precompute any further visibility information. (I believe Descent, which was released before I even started writing the Thief engine, had already done this, but I don't know the details.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief engine kept a representation of the level in which the open areas (the areas you could see and/or walk) were divided into convex polyhedra known as cells. Each cell contained zero or more visible "world polygons" along the boundaries of the cell that were the visible surfaces of the world. Cells which adjoined other cells had special boundary polygons called "portals" which marked the adjacency between the cells. If you could see into a given cell, then you could see into adjoining cells through the portals to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine what part of the level was currently visible and needed rendering, the engine conducted a breadth-first traversal of the portals and cells starting from the location of the viewpoint. As each portal was traversed, the cells reached were added to the visible list. Each considered portal was transformed in 3D, checked if it was back-facing, and if not it was projected to 2D. Then a "bounding octagon" was generated, which consisted of a regular 2D bounding box and a 45-degree rotated bounding box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a portal led from cell A to cell B, then we compared that portal's bounding octagon to a bounding octagon of the visiblity of cell A. If the two didn't overlap, then the portal wasn't actually visible. If it was visible, then the intersection of cell A's octagon and the portal's octagon was the part of cell B that was visible through this portal, so it added that to the list. (It was possible you would see into cell B through multiple paths, so the engine had to accumulate all the visible regions, which it did by simply keeping a conservative bounding octagon of all the incoming path octagons along paths. If you had two small view paths into one cell, the two at opposite ends of the cell, the bounding octagon would be much bigger, typically the size of the whole cell.) The cell containing the viewpoint was always fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quake precomputed similar information: for each cell, Quake stored the list of all other cells that were visible from anywhere in that cell. This result could be less tight; for example, if you had a long corridor with many side rooms, and that long corridor was a single cell, then in Quake it would always try to render all the side rooms, whereas Thief would only try to render the entry cell to each of the side rooms (since those cells would always be adjacent to the corridor and visible), but Thief could cull the rooms themselves if they weren't currently visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full cell-portal-analysis didn't scale well to higher polygon counts, so the engine was limping by the time the last game shipped with it (in other words, it had a lot of overhead when hardware accelerated).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quake reduced overdraw by using a span-buffering ("edge list") technique in which world surfaces were (conceptually) drawn front-to-back and each pixel was only drawn exactly once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief drew polygons back-to-front, so they did overdraw each other. Thief's overdraw was already reduced compared to Quake's "naive" (pre-edge-list) overdraw because of the tighter bounds from traversing the portals dynamically, as described above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief further reduced overdraw by clipping each rendered world polygon by the bounding octagon for the visibility of the cell containing that polygon. (This is part of why bounding octagons were used, as they significantly reduced overdraw in some cases compared to just using bounding boxes. In the limit if we had clipped to the exact portals leading to each cell, this would have resulted in drawing each pixel only once as well.) I don't have any recollection of what our typical overdraw was using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this to work, Thief had to store world polygons in cells. This means that world polygons that extended through multiple cells had to be split; Quake was often able to preserve those as single polygons since it stored the polygons in a BSP tree directly on split planes. I'm not sure how much difference this made, though, since both Thief and Quake also had to split polygons for surface caching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2D clipping to the bounding octagon meant that many Thief polygons ended up being rendered as 8-sided polygons. This wasn't a problem. In fact, clipping was straightforward and efficient since it was purely 2D along simple axes, and there were no S,T (i.e. U,V) texture coordinates on polygon vertices, since Thief used a technique I'd previously published in the PC Game Programmer's Encyclopedia in which the texture coordinates were defined as a 3D vector basis independent of the vertices, and then texture coordinates for spans and pixels were computed directly from the basis vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The skybox was drawn just by tagging polygons with a special texture, then when drawing it, taking the transformed 2D polygon and clipping it to each skybox polygon and using the skybox texture mapping for each of them, or something like that. I don't remember 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After discovering all the cells that needed rendering, Thief would decide which objects needed rendering. Only objects that were in visible cells might need rendering. However, Thief also computed a 2D bounding box (or probably octagon) of each potentially visible object and compared it against the bounding octagon for any cells containing the object. (Quake had nothing like this since it didn't process portals at runtime.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the Thief engine was better about rejecting invisible cells entirely, and was able to reject objects that weren't currently visible even if the cells containing them were, Thief could generally handle more object-dense worlds than a renderer made with Quake technology could have. You couldn't necessarily have more visible objects at once, but you could put more objects in overall as long as you limited where you could see them from, and so Thief generally was able to have well-stocked kitchens and dining tables and sideboards and such.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this was just dumb luck as I hadn't chosen these algorithms for that reason in particular, especially as the engine development long preceded the eventual morphing of the game design into Thief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quake rendered objects by generating a z-buffer from the world polygons (even though the world polygons themselves didn't z-test), and then testing and updating that z-buffer when rendering objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief didn't use a z-buffer. Instead, Thief drew the world back-to-front ("painter's algorithm"), and interleaved rendering of world polygons and objects to make them appear to occlude each other appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many games in the software rendering era (which rarely used z-buffers) exhibited sorting issues where objects would become visible through walls or invisible behind walls they shouldn't be, and portals/cells didn't offer any special guarantees that would avoid this problem. (For example, Descent exhibited such problems.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This really bothered me and I worked very hard to fix it. The sorting algorithm in Thief is the most complicated painter's algorithm sorter I've every heard of; I remember having to write a little mathematical proof at one point for one part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't remember the details, but I'll try and sketch out some of the issues and how it probably worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally the cells were sorted based on the portal-traversal-discovery order, which provided a topological front-to-back sort order that could be reversed for back-to-front rendering. However, there were some issues and so by the time Thief shipped the cells were actually being sorted by a BSP tree. This meant that the sort order was very far from a breadth-first search; if you were near the rootmost split plane, the draw order could feature very-close-to-the-viewer cells drawn before very-far-from-the-viewer cells if the cells and viewer happened to fall on the appropriate sides of some BSP split plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the BSP tree there was no danger that the world polygons would render in the wrong order, but there was some danger that objects could sort wrong with respect to each other or the world polygons. To avoid this, the Thief engine (again, I'm kind of guessing here) conceptually numbered the cells in the order it would draw them. An object in cell N would normally render immediately after drawing the (inward-facing) world polygons in cell N and before drawing the walls of cell N+1. However, sometimes objects would lie in multiple cells. An object in cell M and N, with M &amp;lt; N, would need to be drawn after all the walls of cell M, but the parts of it in cell M might be obscured by walls in cell N or indeed in any of the cells between M and N. (A common case that came up: a corridor (cell) with a niche (cell) holding a torch, with the torch slightly protruding into the corridor. The niche is M, and the corridor is N--e.g. if the viewpoint is in the corridor, then the corridor is "closer" to the viewpoint in a back-to-front rendering sense. For example, one of the walls of the corridor will occlude parts of the niche.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To deal with those complexities, Thief would consider whether it was acceptable to draw a given object in its frontmost cell N (or, indeed, at any point in the draw order between its rearmost and frontmost). To do this it would compute bounding octagons on the objects and on the world polygons and see whether the polygons occluded the objects. If a world polygon was supposed to be "in front" of an object and the bounding octagons intersected, then it wasn't safe to move the object later in the rendering order to a point later than that world polygon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief engine would resolve what range it was valid to draw each object in between backmost and frontmost cells containing that object; if the object was only in one cell it would always be considered as just being in that cell. Once this was determined, Thief then attempted to resolve object-vs-object sorting. Because an object might extend through multiple cells and then be behind or in front of an object that was in a single cell, objects that were only in one cell might need to be moved back or moved forward in the sort order anyway; in other words, the final range of cells that an object might be considered for rendering after might cover a larger range than just between backmost and frontmost containing cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief attempted to use the above ranges to find some sort order for objects, holding the cell sort order fixed, so that objects and world polygons would all inter-sort correctly. (This was where that proof came in.) However, sometimes this was impossible. For example, in the torch-in-the-niche case described above, it's possible for one world polygon in cell N to be occluded by the torch (the wall with the niche on it extending behind the niche), but another world polygon in N to occlude the niche and part of the torch (the wall with the niche on it extend forward towards the viewer). In this case, there is no sort order of objects vs. cells that works, because parts of the torch occlude the cell while parts of the same cell occlude the torch. It would be fixable by interleaving the world polygons from the cell with the torch, instead of always drawing all the world polygons from one cell as a unit, but not all cases could be fixed that way, so Thief actually never did that (it always drew all world polygons from one cell as a unit) -- unless I'm remembering wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead Thief had an entirely different, extremely expensive mechanism that it fell back on to solve difficult sorting problems. Each object could be "split" into multiple pieces, one per cell. In each cell, only the part of the object which was contained in that cell was rendered. This wasn't done by actually splitting the object, but rather by rendering it multiple times, once for each "piece", and for each piece dynamically clipping the object with a "user clip plane", using similar technology to the frustum clipping that was also being done. (In complex cases, multiple clip planes would be needed; however, it was only ever necessary to clip to portals between the cells the object was in, and not literally clip to all the planes defining each cell.) If this technique was applied, then that part of that object could always be drawn in or after that cell. However, although it didn't increase the per-pixel costs, it required transforming and clipping the object multiple times, so it was rather expensive. (I encouraged designers to place their torches fully inside the niches instead.) This was particularly bad when rendering characters, which were skinned, since I think the skinning transformations would be performed multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also had another problem: if you had three cells arranged so that the portals between them formed a T, then the dynamic clipping could create t-junctions at the border. These would then cause cracks in the rendering. I don't remember how/if we fixed this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During development I noticed that if you used all the walls of a cell for user clip planes--not just the portals--then if an object interpentrated a wall, it would be clipped away, looking exactly like a z-buffer rendering. Normally these artifacts arose because the game physics allowed an object to interpenetrate briefly, so it was actually better not to clip those objects, and then they wouldn't look (from most angles) like they were going through the wall. But we could've used an effect like that to allow creatures that could move through walls even without though we had no z-buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After my positive experience with user clip planes I was frustrated over the next few years that GPUs didn't efficiently/easily support them. (Even in D3D9, they're still done in the pixel shader; although you can use z and stencil to cull more tightly and reduce pixel shading costs.) Of course, with the z-buffer, it's not clear there are lots of use cases, but there's a chicken-and-egg problem to that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core technique for rendering texture mapped polygons with decent precomputed shadows is very similar (identical?) to Quake. Thief used light mapping and a surface cache to store the lit surfaces. I refer you to Mike Abrash's articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My recollection is that we added this to the engine after we (the Thief team) saw the Quake "QTest" release. However, I'm doubtful there really was a Thief team at that point. According to wikipedia, QTest came out February 24, 1996. Terra Nova came out on March 5, 1996, so I guess we had built our final version of Terra Nova by the time QTest was released, but I can't imagine we'd geared up a whole team yet. In fact I don't know for sure when exactly I did the original research version of this engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At one point objects raycasted to all (or the top N) light sources to determine if they were visible to it or not and turned the entire light on/off over the entire object to simulate objects going in-and-out of shadow. But I don't know if we shipped with this or using the "check the lightmap value on the floor", which I seem to recall we at least considered using for the player's visiblity to guards (to avoid players being tricked/confused by places that appeared to casual inspection to being in shadow).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief levels were created using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) methods, based again on knowledge that that was how Quake worked. Technologically though Thief worked very differently from Quake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief CSG model was "temporal", which maybe I can better explain by analogy to Photoshop. In photoshop, you have layers. Stuff placed in one layer obscures stuff in lower layers, except if you use more interesting blend modes, in which case stuff in a layer changes the stuff visible below it but has no affect on things above it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Algorithmically, you can think of generating the final image by processing each layer in the image sequentially, from back to front, compositing it with the "image so far". At the time each image is processed, the image-so-far contains the accumulated effects of all the earlier (lower) layers, and then the layer is processed and the image-so-far is changed and that layer cannot have any further effect except by data it left in the image-so-far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally we think of the photoshop layer model as a stack of 2D layers, but you could instead think of the above algorithm as the model, and think of the layers not as a "vertical" stack but as an ordered sequence of operations to perform. This is what I mean by a temporal model, and this is the model that Thief used for its CSG. (If the vertical photoshop layer stack is a vertical third dimension of the 2D images, then the Thief layering model would be a fourth dimension on the 3D shapes, and thinking about this as four-dimensional space is not very effective.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thief CSG took as input a series of "operations" arranged in an order over time. Those operations were "brush placements", where a brush was a 3D convex solid plus a characterization of how the area covered by that solid would be changed by the operation. The entire space started solid, so one brush operation was "carve out a hole in this area"--in other words "change the area covered by this brush to open". For example you would use this to carve out a room. Another placed solid matter; you could use this to create a pillar. Another placed water, and another lava. Because space could be of 4 types (solid, air, water, or lava -- oh hey, the 4 classical elements!), each operation could be considered by which output type it produced. Moreover, we allowed these operations to be selective. For example, the "flood brush" turned air into water, but left all other types alone. This made it easier to fill an area with water--you could construct it entirely with air and then fill the lower half with water. Because of the temporal aspect, you could then go and change some of the water to "air" if you needed to. It would have been possible to make brush types that were much complicated (air turns to water, water turns to solid, solid turns to air, and lava unchanged) but this wasn't actually useful so I think all the brush types were of the unconditional-single-type or conditional-single-type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with Photoshop layers, the temporal aspect was something under user control; you could move a brush forwards or backwards in time. Unfortunately, this was much harder to visualize (there was no "layers" window) and I'm not sure designers were really thrilled with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In comparison, Quake started with a level that was all open space and placed solids. It used a more-traditional-CSG explicit-subtraction operation. Water was handled by making all water brushes occur first temporally, so that all the effective temporal sequence of operations was: all air =&amp;gt; some air turns to water =&amp;gt; all solids are placed. Because subtraction was explicit on the solid brushes before they were added to the world, the subtraction couldn't "accidentally" erase water, so there was no need for an explicit temporal model (the set of things you could do in Quake was more limited, but it supported almost everything that mattered in practice--although some designers came up with some strange sequences of operations in Thief to create more complicated shapes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Quake levels started empty, Quake had invisible "exterior" surfaces that required a separate process to detect and eliminate. If the level wasn't watertight, then the exterior could be reachable and the automated tools couldn't eliminate it. In contrast, because the Thief level started solid, this was never necessary. (I think Unreal's CSG may have started as solid as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no idea what I was doing when I implemented the Thief CSG system (despite having the opportunity to pepper John Carmack with questions) so I made a terrible choice. The Thief system worked by dividing the world up into convex polyhedra and keeping track of what each polyhedron's type i.e. air, solid, water, lava, which I call the "medium". To do this, I stored the world as a solid BSP tree; the BSP tree classifies all of space into convex polyhedra (except at the edges where it may have unbounded shapes extending to infinity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a BSP tree for this had a performance advantage, but I didn't do it for that reason; I did it because I literally couldn't think of any other way to compute the output. This way I was able to sequentially add each brush to the BSP tree and then apply the medium-transformation-operations to each BSP leaf that the brush contained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But reading the Quake source, it turns out you can do it a different way: intersect every brush with every other brush directly, without a spatial data strucure. By being careful, you can build a growing list of convex polyhedra all of which are non-overlapping. You can then add a spatial data structure to accelerate determining which ones might overlap, but without affecting the computation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference is that the BSP-tree based CSG tree would have situations where a brush early in the processing would be inserted in the tree early and would introduce a BSP split plane near the root which then extended across the whole level or a significant part of it. This might randomly come close to an edge or vertex of a totally unrelated brush, causing an extra split in that brush and introducing additional epsilon problems. As CSG is already painful numeric geometric algorithms with epsilon problems, introducing this extra uncontrollable problem was terrible. The Thief editor was (is?) notorious for having weird problems where a change to one brush might trigger a failure in the CSG generator at an entirely unrelated place in the level--a failure which meant the level simply failed to "compile".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partway through Thief development I switched everything in the CSG engine from floats to doubles and cranked down the epsilon, which made things better but didn't solve the problem properly, but I realize in hindsight it would have been much, much better to have simply avoided the BSP tree entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The epsilon problems were exacerbated by the crazy way I built the polygons and portals directly from the BSP-tree in a t-junc free way by computing a shared mesh along each BSP split plane to guarantee that vertices on one side of the split plane would always have a matching vertex on the other side; this introduced a much more complicated set of invariants that had to be maintained that also had epsilon problems. It meant I didn't have to write a post-processing t-junction eliminator the way Quake did, but in hindsight that would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking Glass games prior to Thief such as System Shock 1 and Terra Nova had used a "lines of constant-Z" mapper to perform perspective texture mapping. Those games typically used the perspective texture mapper for large, near polygons, but used an affine mapper for distant polygons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief used a custom-written perspective mapper for all polygons. It used the trick used in Quake of issuing a floating-point divide for perspective correction for every N pixels which then executed in parallel with the texture mapping of the next N pixels; this worked because the Pentium would execute the floating-point divide "in the background" if you only used integer instructions after it (the Pentium was not an out-of-order processor in general).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thief computed the perspective correction every 8 pixels (that is, N above was 8). Thief aligned the correction so it occurred on pixels whose x coordinates were multiples of 8. The beginning and ending of a span of pixels could be less than 8, and would call a general-purpose N-pixel mapper, but the 8-pixel spans called a routine that was hardcoded to compute exactly 8 pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the engine changed over time and was initially used for research, it supported two different formats that textures could be stored in. One was restricted to 256x256 textures, or rather textures with powers-of-two sizes and in which the stride/pitch was always 256. This used an inner loop similar to the one I wrote up for the PCGPE. The second one supported arbitrary non-power-of-two textures but didn't support wrapping. This is the one we switched to when we added surface cached lighting, because padding those textures widths to multiples of 256 would have been far too wasteful. I believe the "step table" indexed-by-carry-flag trick used in this mapper came directly from Mike Abrash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Details for x86 programmers: &lt;p&gt;Here is the code for the second pixel of the non-power-of-two texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;adc ebx,edi add eax,ebp sbb edi,edi ; save v carry add esi,edx ; update u mov byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al mov al,[ebx] mov edi,_pt_step_table[edi*4+4]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for the second pixel of the 256x256 texture-mapper-unrolled-8-times (not used in the shipping game, unless maybe it was used for water surface):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;add esi,edx mov ecx,ebx adc bl,dl add eax,ebp adc bh,dh mov al,[edi+ecx] mov byte ptr _pt_buffer+1,al and ebx,0babebeach&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spacing of both pieces of code shows that they were optimized for the Pentium; each one uses a nominal 4 cycles per pixel. (They also both would trigger "Partial Register Stalls" on the Pentium Pro.) The Pentium had a 2-cycle "AGI" stall that you couldn't use a register as an address for 2 cycles after it's computed, so you can see the texture fetch (from ebx or edi+ecx) is designed to compute those registers two cycles before the fetch. The full 8-pixel routines use 32 and 33 Pentium-pairs of instructions for 8 pixels (although there's also setup to get the right values into the right registers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 0babebeach at the end there is a 0xdeadbeef-style constant that relied on "self-modifying" code to update the constant, a common trick on the 486 and Pentium. Those processor had an "and ebx,memory_location" instruction, but it wasn't single-cycle, whereas "and ebx,#immediate" was single-cycle. This meant there were 9 places in the code that had to be modified (this is an 8-unrolled loop, plus the non-unrolled loop), but only when the texture was changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I totally missed out on the possibility of reblocking the texture to improve cache usage, which might have allowed significant performance improvements (I don't know); I've heard that Build and other engines did do this, and since the surface cache in Thief was built in 8x8 blocks anyway it probably wouldn't have been hard to support on that end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking Glass games generally demanded flexibility, and graphics engines faced with that need for flexibility often had a combinatorial explosion of texture mappers to handle all the different cases. The texture mappers I wrote for Thief sacrificed a litttle performance for the sake of simplicity and maintainability and maximum flexibility; the texture mapping routines above ended with an indirect branch which would branch to a routine that would decide what to do with the 8 pixels that had just been written into a temporary buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were two kinds of functions that could be invoked at this point. The most common kind was one which wrote to the "framebuffer" (which was actually just a block of RAM somewhere that would be blitted to the screen later) and returned from the original function call that invoked the texture mapper chain. The other kind of function would read the pixels from the temporary buffer, modify them, and write them back to the temporary buffer, then jump to yet another function. You could chain arbitrary numbers of these processing functions, in theory, not that this turned out to be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The codebase had a bunch of these functions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of those weren't used, I think. Paletted lighting in particular required setting up the palette in a particular way, and I used this in the original research engine to demo a gouraud-shaded level running at 640x400 at 20-ish fps on a Pentium 90. The level was a retextured version of Doom 1 E1M1, using a texture made by Kurt Bickenbach. He and I iterated a bit trying to figure out how to make textures that would look good and not too banded in 8-bit using paletted lighting, and we got some visually pleasing results, but in the end paletted lighting was too limited, so we abandoned it. (It was too limited artistically, and it couldn't do pitch black properly; when we ended up with a shadow-oriented game it was clearly wrong, but I think it had been abandoned long before due to the first issue.) Abandoning it meant abandoning hitting that frame rate/resolution target as well, but in the long run this didn't matter that much because LGS games were complicated enough that it's not like we spent 95% of the frame time in the renderer anyway, and we didn't ship it for a long time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engine supported specifying an arbitrary color look-up table ("clut") for each portal, and coloring everything seen through that portal with that clut. This wasn't done by applying this as a post-process on that portal surface, which would have used extra "fill rate", but by storing cluts (and concatenating them into new cluts) and applying them while rendering surfaces seen through the portal. This effect could have been used to make force fields or such things, although it ended up underutilized. (Note, though, that if a single cell were visible through multiple paths, and the paths had different sequences of cluts, there was no correct way to render it; the Thief engine chose randomly. Probably there was no good solution to this problem, but since it was never exercised, it didn't matter.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During development, this was used to make water "foggy", where the more underwater portals away something was, the more opaque the water became. However, this looked pretty terrible as it showed the portal boundaries clearly and although we had all gotten used to it since it was in the engine for years, I did eventually turn off the portal-varying underwater fog, replacing it with a fixed underwater fog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was also used to color the water surface--the water surface actually used a purely transparent texture and surfaces underwater were colored while they were rendered, instead of having to use the "translucent" read-modify-write mapper. This means the object renderers also needed to support rendering with a clut; I don't remember the details since I didn't work on those, but this was probably something we tended to support by default anyway, so I doubt this was problematic for those renderers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what happened for objects that stuck through the water surface; I guess those were forced to use the dynamic user clip plane path. Because Quake used a z-buffer, Quake couldn't have both a distant wall-underwater and the water surface visible at the same pixel (the z-buffer could only store one depth), so the Quake water surface was opaque, at least in the software renderer. I'm not sure what Quake-derived engines like Half-Life did; one expensive solution would be to render the world except the water, then render the objects, then finally render the transparent water through the z-buffer (much as we do with hardware). The z-buffered transparent water effect would have been much more expensive in pixel costs than Thief's approach, although Thief was spending more effort per triangle/vertex having to render the object multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Thief, most world surfaces simply used the arbitrary-pitch no-wrapping sampler and the plain store-to-memory writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I imagine that the object renderers used the shared LGS software rendering libraries and so didn't use these mappers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't write all the graphics technology used in Thief. I'll call out the things I didn't write below. I associate each of them with someone at LGS who did the work, but I'm not sure the people I can think of were the only contributors to that effort, so rather than risk missing important people out, I'm just not going to name names if multiple people might have been involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3D camera system, vertex transformation, and clipping processing were part of a shared technology library used by all LGS products. (Thief may have been the first customer of that tech--previous games having used fixed-point so they could run on x86 computers without floating point acceleration.) Thief batched together all the vertices used in a single cell and transformed them all at once, whether they were visible polygons or portals, which was possible since the 3D vertex API allowed separating things out like that. (Sort of like compiled vertex arrays.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted before, general object rendering presumably also went through shared libraries. Object polygons were sorted using a BSP tree; James Fleming had written a very clever system that significantly reduced the number of BSP node decisions that needed to be made, based on the fact that single-sided polygons often couldn't occlude each other from any angle. (For example, I believe a polygonal torus, which is an object that self-occludes and needs sorting if the polygons are two-sided, can be statically sorted if it's made of single-sided polygons.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Thief used character skinning with skeletal animation to render its characters, and I never touched a single line of code of that system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I quit Looking Glass for a time; during my absence hardware acceleration support was added. (I came back and added support for colored lighting in the lighting generator and maybe the surface cache or something.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re building tools that help NASA, Tesla, Google, and hundreds of top teams bring the future to life. Can you help us make it even better?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re into engineering and building physical products, you probably know the sourcing grind. You email a few suppliers, wait days for quotes, answer the same questions twice (or ten times). Track everything in spreadsheets, deal with logistics, revisions, customs (you gotta love new tariffs every week), forms, reports and surprising delays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s expensive, slow, tedious and painful – and it pulls you away from actual engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jiga fixes that. We connect engineers directly with vetted manufacturers, handle quoting and communication in one place, build AI workflows to deal with the administrative work, and give full visibility into every order from prototype into mass production. What used to take weeks now takes hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We build the platform the manufacturing industry has been craving for years, and we’re aiming for the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most companies talk about transparency and trust. We actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. We share the numbers. As a team member, you’ll see the full picture: revenue, valuation, runway, roadmap, sales pipeline, what’s working and what fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. We have been remote and async from day one and we love it. But we also love our team: once a year we bring everyone together to a small offsite in paradise for co-working, hiking, eating, drinking and sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. We don’t count hours, we track performance. You are senior enough to know what it means, we don’t need to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. We don’t do busy-work. We meet for a weekly all-hands and a team sync. That’s it. Everything else is async. Your calendar will be empty to write code, talk to customers or to fix problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. We deliver 11/10 customer experience. We don’t settle for “good enough.” Quick response times, going the extra mile, creating fans not just users. It’s part of our DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. We decide fast. The person closest to the problem makes the call. No approval chains, no review committees and no endless layers of management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. Profitability is freedom. We are cashflow positive, growing revenue by 3x YoY. No desperate fundraising, no panic pivots, no mass layoffs. The magic we’re building is being built to last for long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8. “Don’t drink the Kool-Aid” is our motto. If you see something that needs fixing, it’s your duty to raise a flag or just fix it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;9. We hire the best people. We’ve gathered a super group of the best talents in engineering, supply chain and sales. Everyone knows what they need to do and cruising through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10. Ship now, iterate later. Perfection is the enemy of done. We’d rather learn from something that is live on production, than debate something theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple is Fighting for TSMC Capacity as Nvidia Takes Center Stage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;[Exclusive] A 15-year relationship helped TSMC grow and Apple leap ahead of rivals. But now the iPhone maker is struggling to get access to chip production as it competes with Nvidia for wafer supply.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When CC Wei visited Cupertino last August, he had bad news for his largest client. Apple would need to acquiesce to the largest price rise in years, TSMC’s CEO told its executives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim Cook and his team took the news on the chin. Wei had been telegraphing hikes in earnings calls over the past few quarters, and the Taiwanese chip maker’s rising gross margins were testament to its increasing pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That wasn’t the worst news, my sources tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple, which once held a dominant position on TSMC’s customer list, now needs to fight for production capacity. With the continuing AI boom, and each GPU from clients like Nvidia and AMD taking up a larger footprint per wafer, the iPhone maker’s chip designs are no longer guaranteed a place among TSMC’s almost two dozen fabs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Wei probably didn’t tell Cook is that Apple may no longer be his largest client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Culpium analysis and discussions with sources in the supply chain, Nvidia likely took top spot in at least one or two quarters of last year. “We don’t discuss that,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told Culpium Thursday when asked about the change in client rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final data will be unveiled in a few months when TSMC releases its annual report — which includes revenue from its top clients — but there’s every chance that Apple’s lead for the full year narrowed significantly and may have even fallen below Nvidia’s. If it didn’t happen in 2025, then it’s almost certain to do so in 2026, my sources tell me.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public data helps tells the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s revenue climbed 36% last year to $122 billion, it reported Thursday. Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year through January 2026 is set to climb 62% while Apple’s product revenue — which excludes services — is on track to grow just 3.6% for the 12-months to December 2025, according to Culpium estimates based on earnings reports and company guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s role as the primary driver of TSMC revenue growth ended five years ago. In 2018 TSMC sales would have even fallen if not for incremental purchases by Apple that year. Now, the Cupertino company is posting low single-digit revenue growth while Nvidia is skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for this change is two-fold, and pretty obvious: AI is driving massive demand for high-powered chips, while the smartphone boom has plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s sales from high-performance computing, which includes AI chips, climbed 48% last year on top of 58% growth the year before. Smartphone revenue climbed just 11%, slower than 23% in the prior year.2 That trend will continue this year, and for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revenue in 2026 will rise close to 30%, yet capital expenditure will climb around 32% to a record of somewhere between $52 billion and $56 billion, TSMC said Thursday. Longer term, growth will average 25% in the five years through 2029 yet the AI segment will climb an average of 55% or more over the same period, the company said. That’s higher than a prior forecast for a mid-40 percent figure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ultimate flex for TSMC came Thursday when it showed off not only record revenue and net income, but a gross margin approaching that of software makers and fabless chip designers. In the December quarter, that figure was an astounding 62.3%, 280 basis points higher than the prior period. If not for its overseas fabs (Arizona and Japan) gross margin would have been even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two caveats that are important. First, while smartphone processors are the largest portion of chips bought by Apple, they’re not the only type. Processors for Macs come under HPC, while it also has a strong lineup of custom chips used in accessories which fall under digital consumer electronics. Second, Nvidia isn’t the only HPC client. AMD is a major buyer of capacity for its own GPUs while Amazon and Google are on the growing list of customers developing in-house AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put another way, Apple’s chip catalog is broader and more varied, while Nvidia’s lineup is more concentrated around a huge number of wafers at, or near, leading-edge. It’s for these reasons that Apple will remain important for at least another decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the near-term, however, TSMC’s technology roadmap coupled with broader industry trends favor Nvidia, AMD and their ilk, meaning Apple may need to keep fighting for capacity over the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC is already producing chips in volume at 2 nanometer (called N2), currently its most advanced node, with Apple a major buyer. But in the second half of this year it’s set to ramp up both a new variant called N2P as well as a new node called A16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company’s business model is a little quirky. Instead of repurposing an existing factory for new technology, TSMC just builds a new one. This ensures no interruption to output and allows it to squeeze the most out of old tools and processes. In general, this means any new capacity that TSMC builds is for a new node. As a result, it has numerous fabs still churning out chips on technology that’s a decade older or more.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In TSMC CEO CC Wei’s words A16, with Super Power Rail, is “best for HPC with complex signal routes.” SPR is TSMC’s version of backside power, a newer approach designed to separate a chip’s signal from its power supply. Intel is also developing this technology, and many believe it’ll be the key to the US company’s prospects at stealing foundry share from its Taiwan rival.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, TSMC has A14 which it expects to bring into volume production around 2028. Some call this the next full node after N2, labeling A16 as not a “full node.” In truth, all of these names are as much marketing terms as they are technology designators. Nevertheless, as SemiAnalysis recently wrote in a fabulous report on the TSMC-Apple relationship, the balance will shift back to Apple because A14 is designed “for both mobile and HPC from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, what Apple offers is stability. Nvidia has been a client for a lot longer than Apple, but broadly speaking it’s a bit niche. Right now that “niche” is the hottest product on the planet, but niche it is. Apple, on the other hand, has products being made in no fewer than a dozen TSMC fabs. Even if Nvidia did overtake Apple by purchases, the breadth of its manufacturing footprint at TSMC is nowhere near as large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This distinction may not matter now, but it probably will at some point. The AI boom won’t last forever. The bubble may burst, or it may slowly deflate, but the growth trajectory will surely flatten and that means demand for leading-edge AI chips will fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wei knows this, which is why he’s expanding both quickly yet cautiously. “I am also very nervous,” he said at the company’s investor conference on Thursday in Taipei. “If we didn’t do it carefully, it would be a big disaster for TSMC for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip giant has recently come under fire, including from noted analyst Benedict Evans, for being “unwilling/unable to expand capacity fast enough to meet Nvidia’s book.” I think this is wrong, and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The risk of under-investing is significantly greater than the risk of over-investing,” Evans cited Google CEO Sundar Pichai as saying back in 2Q 2024, as if to make the point. TSMC and Alphabet, Google’s parent, have approximately the same gross margin. But their business models couldn’t be more different. Nvidia’s financials are also unlike TSMC’s. Their respective capex strategies need to reflect this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alphabet’s capital intensity, calculated as acquisitions of property, plant &amp;amp; equipment divided by revenue, was just 15% for full-year 2024. TSMC’s is more than double that at over 33%. More importantly, depreciation — which is where the cost of capex is reflected in earnings — was just 10% of Alphabet’s cost of revenue. For TSMC, this figure is more than four times higher at 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Nvidia, which is a tier-one buyer of TSMC’s output, the data is more stark. Capital intensity was just 2.5% for 2024, while depreciation was only 5.7% of the cost of revenue. As a fabless chipmaker, it can enjoy gross margins of over 70%. Its only real risk is holding excess inventory. Even then, it could have written off its entire inventory at the end of October and still maintain a gross margin approaching that of its chief supplier. What’s more, neither of these clients have anywhere near the customer-concentration risk of TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complaint that TSMC could and should build faster ignores the fact that it’s the one left holding the baby if a downturn comes and demand falls. It takes two to three years to build a new fab, Wei explained, so the company must skate where the puck is going without thinking too much about where it’s been. “Even if we spend 52 to 56 billion this year, the contribution this year is none,“ Wei said Thursday. Its major cost, buying equipment, remains on the books no matter what revenue it brings in for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the best part of a decade, Apple was the one driving TSMC’s need to keep spending on new facilities. Today it’s Nvidia, and Jensen Huang is starting to wield more power than Tim Cook. But neither has to bother with the expensive business of actually manufacturing semiconductors, merely the hassle of begging CC Wei for wafers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For such clients, the foundry’s capacity is a fixed cost that they needn’t worry about. Which is precisely why eight of the world’s ten largest companies turn to TSMC to make their chips,4 and in return the Taiwanese giant gets to reap the rewards during boom times like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More from Culpium:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these companies state their purchase and sales relationships explicitly, but instead use terms like Customer A and Vendor Y when providing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to 2019, TSMC categorized revenue by Communications, Computer, Consumer, and Industrial but the data still reflects this smartphones v HPC dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not ALWAYS the case. In recent years it has repurposed old fabs, but that’s the exception and not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other two are Saudi Aramco and TSMC itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Archaeologists Say They’ve Unearthed a Massive Medieval Cargo Ship That’s the Largest Vessel of Its Kind Ever Found&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Spotted off the coast of Denmark, the “Svaelget 2” is a cog, a kind of large trading vessel used in the Middle Ages. Experts say the 600-year-old discovery is “exceptionally well-preserved”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forty feet below the waves of Oresund, the strait between Denmark and Sweden, researchers have discovered the wreckage of a 600-year-old ship. Extravagantly outfitted and remarkably preserved, it’s a medieval cargo vessel also known as a cog. Experts say it’s the largest ship of its kind ever found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maritime archaeologists from Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum came across the shipwreck while surveying the seabed. According to a statement from the museum, the silt-covered vessel—called Svaelget 2—measures about 92 feet long, 30 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Experts estimate its cargo capacity was 300 tons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The find is a milestone for maritime archaeology,” says archaeologist Otto Uldum, the leader of the excavation, in the statement. “It is the largest cog we know of, and it gives us a unique opportunity to understand both the construction and life on board the biggest trading ships of the Middle Ages.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cogs were developed around the tenth century “as a safe and efficient means to transport massive quantities of goods,” writes Artnet’s Min Chen. “Their substantial cargo holds trumped [those] of Viking vessels such as knarrs, while their towering sides made them harder to board during sea skirmishes.” Per the statement, the large vessels were made to sail north from the Netherlands, around Denmark and toward the Baltic Sea. Though massive, a cog could be managed by a small crew.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” Uldum says. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uldum adds that shipbuilders made the cogs as large as possible to transport bulky cargo, like timber, bricks, salt and other food basics. No traces of cargo were found with the wreck, but researchers did uncover some of the artifacts reflecting the sailors’ daily lives, including shoes, combs and rosary beads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wrecked vessel is “exceptionally well preserved,” per the museum. Because the entire starboard side was buried in sand, it was protected from erosion. There, divers found lots of the ship’s rigging—the ropes and chains used to “control the sail, secure the mast and keep the cargo safe,” Uldum says. “It gives us a real opportunity to say something entirely new about how cogs were equipped for sailing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Svaelget 2 boasts other uniquely well-preserved structures. On its stern, researchers were shocked to find extensive remains of a castle, a kind of covered deck where the crew would have sought shelter. Records show that castles were distinctive features of medieval cogs, but no physical evidence of them had previously been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” Uldum says. “This time we have the archaeological proof.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers were also shocked to find remains of Svaelget 2’s brick galley, where the crew prepared food. Constructed of 200 bricks and 15 tiles, this type of fireproof galley allowed sailors to cook over an open fire. Nearby, divers found bronze cooking pots, wooden dishes, ceramic bowls and remains of meat and fish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dendrochronological analysis of the shipwreck’s wood revealed that Svaelget 2 was built around 1410. Its planks are made of Pomeranian oak from modern-day Poland, and the wood of its frame came from the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Quick fact: What is dendrochronological analysis?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists use dendrochronology to determine the age of certain artifacts by studying tree rings in the wood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The size of Svaelget 2 is an indication of a robust trading economy in northern Europe in medieval times. It would have “required a society that could finance, build and equip these enormous ships,” as well as an adequate demand for imported cargo in faraway lands, Uldum explains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the centuries leading up to Svaelget 2’s construction were characterized by an agricultural boom in Europe. As Agree Ahmed wrote for Works in Progress in 2025, the continent’s population subsequently grew from 18 million in the seventh century to more than 70 million by the 14th century. The growth enabled more international trading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Perhaps the find does not change the story we already know about medieval trade,” Uldum says. “But it does allow us to say that it was in ships like Svaelget 2 that this trade was created. We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre Fly.io, and this is the place in the post where weâd normally tell you that our job is to take your containers and run them on our own hardware all around the world. But last week, we launched Sprites, and they donât work that way at all. Sprites are something new: Docker without Docker without Docker. This post is about how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacement-level homeowners buy boxes of pens and stick them in “the pen drawer”. What the elites know: you have to think adversarially about pens. “The purpose of a system is what it does”; a household’s is to uniformly distribute pens. Months from now, the drawer will be empty, no matter how many pens you stockpile. Instead, scatter pens every place you could possibly think to look for one â drawers, ledges, desks. Any time anybody needs a pen, several are at hand, in exactly the first place they look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the best way I’ve found to articulate the idea of Sprites, the platform we just launched at Fly.io. Sprites are ball-point disposable computers. Whatever mark you mean to make, we’ve rigged it so you’re never more than a second or two away from having a Sprite to do it with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites are Linux virtual machines. You get root. They &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; in just a second or two: so fast, the experience of creating and shelling into one is identical to SSH'ing into a machine that already exists. Sprites all have a 100GB durable root filesystem. They put themselves to sleep automatically when inactive, and cost practically nothing while asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, I barely feel the need to name my Sprites. Sometimes I’ll just type &lt;code&gt;sprite create dkjsdjk&lt;/code&gt; and start some task. People at Fly.io who use Sprites have dozens hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There aren’t yet many things in cloud computing that have the exact shape Sprites do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instant creation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No time limits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent disk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-sleep to a cheap inactive state&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a post about how we managed to get this working. We created a new orchestration stack that undoes some of the core decisions we made for Fly Machines, our flagship product. Turns out, these new decisions make Sprites drastically easier for us to scale and manage. We’re pretty psyched.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, there happen to be three &lt;code&gt;big decisions&lt;/code&gt; we made that get you 90% of the way from Fly Machines to Sprites, which makes this an easy post to write. So, without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decision #1: No More Container Images&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the easiest decision to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fly Machines are approximately OCI containers repackaged as KVM micro-VMs. They have the ergonomics of Docker but the isolation and security of an EC2 instance. We love them very much and they’re clearly the wrong basis for a ball-point disposable cloud computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “one weird trick” of Fly Machines is that they &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; instantly, fast enough that they can wake in time to handle an incoming HTTP request. But they can only do that if you’ve already &lt;code&gt;created&lt;/code&gt; them. You have to preallocate. &lt;code&gt;Creating&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine can take over a minute. What you’re supposed to do is to create a whole bunch of them and &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; them so they’re ready when you need them. But for Sprites, we need &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; to be so fast it feels like they’re already there waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We only murdered user containers because we wanted them dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of what’s slow about &lt;code&gt;creating&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine is containers. I say this with affection: your containers are crazier than a soup sandwich. Huge and fussy, they take forever to pull and unpack. The regional locality sucks;  &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine in SÃ£o Paulo on &lt;code&gt;gru-3838&lt;/code&gt;, and a &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; on  &lt;code&gt;gru-d795&lt;/code&gt; is no faster. A truly heartbreaking amount of engineering work has gone into just allowing our OCI registry to keep up with this system. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a tough job, is all I’m saying. Sprites get rid of the user-facing container. Literally: problem solved. Sprites get to do this on easy mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, today, under the hood, Sprites are still Fly Machines. But they all run from a standard container. Every physical worker knows exactly what container the next Sprite is going to start with, so it’s easy for us to keep pools of “empty” Sprites standing by. The result: a Sprite &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t have any heavy lifting to do; it’s basically just doing the stuff we do when we &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; a Fly Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decision #2: Object Storage For Disks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Sprite comes with 100GB of durable storage. We’re able to do that because the root of storage is S3-compatible object storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can arrange for 100GB of storage for a Fly Machine. Or 200, or 500. The catch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You have to ask (with &lt;code&gt;flyctl&lt;/code&gt;); we can’t reasonably default it in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That storage is NVMe attached to the physical server your Fly Machine is on.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[â ] we print a big red warning about this if you try to make a single-node cluster&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We designed the storage stack for Fly Machines for Postgres clusters. A multi-replica Postgres cluster gets good mileage out of Fly Volumes. Attached storage is fast, but can lose dataâ â if a physical blows up, there’s no magic what rescues its stored bits. You’re stuck with our last snapshot backup. That’s fine for a replicated Postgres! It’s part of what Postgres replication is for. But for anything without explicit replication, it’s a very sharp edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worse, from our perspective, is that attached storage anchors workloads to specific physicals. We have lots of reasons to want to move Fly Machines around. Before we did Fly Volumes, that was as simple as pushing a “drain” button on a server. Imagine losing a capability like that. It took 3 years to get workload migration right with attached storage, and it’s still not “easy”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object stores are the Internetâs Hoover Dams, the closest things we have to infrastructure megaprojects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites jettison this model. We still exploit NVMe, but not as the root of storage. Instead, it’s a read-through cache for a blob on object storage. S3-compatible object stores are the most trustworthy storage technology we have. I can feel my blood pressure dropping just typing the words “Sprites are backed by object storage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implications of this for orchestration are profound. In a real sense, the durable state of a Sprite is simply a URL. Wherever he lays his hat is his home! They migrate (or recover from failed physicals) trivially. It’s early days for our internal tooling, but we have so many new degrees of freedom to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could easily do another 1500-2000 words here on the Cronenberg film Kurt came up with for the actual storage stack, but because it’s in flux, let’s keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sprite storage stack is organized around the JuiceFS model (in fact, we currently use a very hacked-up JuiceFS, with a rewritten SQLite metadata backend). It works by splitting storage into data (“chunks”) and metadata (a map of where the “chunks” are). Data chunks live on object stores; metadata lives in fast local storage. In our case, that metadata store is kept durable with Litestream. Nothing depends on local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(our pre-installed Claude Code will checkpoint aggressively for you without asking)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also buys Sprites fast &lt;code&gt;checkpoint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;restore&lt;/code&gt;. Checkpoints are so fast we want you to use them as a basic feature of the system and not as an escape hatch when things go wrong; like a git restore, not a system restore. That works because both &lt;code&gt;checkpoint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;restore&lt;/code&gt; merely shuffle metadata around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our stack sports a dm-cache-like feature that takes advantage of attached storage. A Sprite has a sparse 100GB NVMe volume attached to it, which the stack uses to cache chunks to eliminate read amplification. Importantly (I can feel my resting heart rate lowering) nothing in that NVMe volume should matter; stored chunks are immutable and their true state lives on the object store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our preference for object storage goes further than the Sprite storage stack. The global orchestrator for Sprites is an Elixir/Phoenix app that uses object storage as the primary source of metadata for accounts. We then give each account an independent SQLite database, again made durable on object storage with Litestream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decision #3: Inside-Out Orchestration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the cloud hosting industry, user applications are managed by two separate, yet equally important components: the host, which orchestrates workloads, and the guest, which runs them. Sprites flip that on its head: the most important orchestration and management work happens inside the VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the trick: user code running on a Sprite isn’t running in the root namespace. We’ve slid a container between you and the kernel. You see an inner environment, managed by a fleet of services running in the root namespace of the VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish weâd done Fly Machines this way to begin with. Iâm not sure thereâs a downside. The inner container allows us to bounce a Sprite without rebooting the whole VM, even on checkpoint restores. I think Fly Machines users could get some mileage out of that feature, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Sprites, we’re pushing this idea as far as we can. The root environment hosts the majority of our orchestration code. When you talk to the global API, chances are you’re talking directly to your own VM. Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our storage stack, which handles checkpoint/restore and persistence to object storage, lives there;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;so does the service manager we expose to Sprites, which registers user code that needs to restart when a Sprite bounces;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;same with logs;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if you bind a socket to &lt;code&gt;*:8080&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll make it available outside the Sprite â yep, that’s in the root namespace too.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform developers at Fly.io know how much easier it can be to hack on &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; (inside the container) than things like &lt;code&gt;flyd&lt;/code&gt;, the Fly Machines orchestrator that runs on  the host. Changes to Sprites don’t restart host components or muck with global state. The blast radius is just new VMs that pick up the change. We sleep on how much platform work doesn’t get done not because the code is hard to write, but because it’s so time-consuming to ensure benign-looking changes don’t throw the whole fleet into metastable failure. We had that in mind when we did Sprites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We Keep The Parts That Worked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites running on Fly.io take advantage of the infrastructure we already have. For instance: Sprites might be the fastest thing there currently exists to get Claude or Gemini to build a full-stack application on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s because Sprites plug directly into Corrosion, our gossip-based service discovery system. When you ask the Sprite API to make a public URL for your Sprite, we generate a Corrosion update that propagates across our fleet instantly. Your application is then served, with an HTTPS URL, from our proxy edges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites live alongside Fly Machines in our architecture. They include some changes that are pure wins, but they’re mostly tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ve always wanted to run Fly Machine disks off object storage (we have an obscure LSVD feature that does this), but the performance isn’t adequate for a hot Postgres node in production.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For that matter, professional production apps ship out of CI/CD systems as OCI containers; that’s a big part of what makes orchestrating Fly Machines so hard.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most (though not all) Sprite usage is interactive, and Sprite users benefit from their VMs aggressively sleeping themselves to keep costs low; e-commerce apps measure responsiveness in milliseconds and want their workloads kept warm.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites are optimized for a different kind of computing than Fly Machines, and while Kurt believes that the future belongs to malleable, personalized apps, I’m not so sure. To me, it makes sense to prototype and acceptance-test an application on Sprites. Then, when you’re happy with it, containerize it and ship it as a Fly Machine to scale it out. An automated workflow for that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, Sprites are a contract with user code: an API and a set of expectations about how the execution environment works. Today, they run on top of Fly Machines. But they don’t have to. Jerome’s working on an open-source local Sprite runtime. We’ll find other places to run them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You Won’t Get It Until You Use Them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t not sound like a shill. Sprites are the one thing we’ve shipped that I personally experience as addictive. I haven’t fully put my finger on why it feels so much easier to kick off projects now that I can snap my finger and get a whole new computer. The whole point is that there’s no reason to parcel them out, or decide which code should run where. You just make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to make this fully click, I think you should just install the &lt;code&gt;sprite&lt;/code&gt; command, make a Sprite, and then run an agent in it. We’ve preinstalled Claude, Gemini, and Codex, and taught them how to do things like checkpoint/restore, registering services, and getting logs. Claude will run in &lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt; mode (because why wouldn’t it). Have it build something; I built a “Chicago’s best sandwich” bracket app for a Slack channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sprites bill only for what you actually use (in particular: only for storage blocks you actually write, not the full 100GB capacity). It’s reasonable to create a bunch. They’re ball-point disposable computers. After you get a feel for them, it’ll start to feel weird not having them handy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countless voiceless people sit alone every day and have no one to talk to, people of all ages, who don't feel that they can join any local groups. So they sit on social media all day when they're not at work or school. How can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People need to purposefully and intentionally do things. Sitting home on an app, watching TV is easy. There is no fear or rejection, there is no work to get out of the house, there is no risk. But there is also no reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My thoughts on this are you need to have multiple roots into your community. This is something that you go to often and talk to people, become a regular, say hi. Think back to how your parents or grandparents did it: They went to church/temple/synagogue, they went to PTA meetings, they talked to their neighbors, they were in clubs, they went to the same bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I think doing things that get you out of the house, consistently the most important part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. People need to make a point to talk to their neighbors, invite them over for dinner or bbqs, make small talk. How towns are constructed now is a hindrance to this (unwalkable towns where all of the houses are big garages in the front and no porches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Join a religious organization. Go to church, but also join the mens/womens group, join a bible studies class. Attend every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Join social clubs / ethnic organization. The polish or ukrainian clubs, knights of columbus, elks, freemasons. Go every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Join a club / league. Chess club, bowling league, softball league, golf league. Tech meetups, DnD Night etc. But you have to talk with people and try to elevate things to friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was a computer nerd in the 2000s, I noticed people used to like to hang around and chat, but I mostly didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, everyone is an internet addict, and I was just ahead of the curve. No one hangs around and chats anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you get off social media, real life becomes far more interesting. The problem with addiction is that it's so stimulating that everything else is boring. You have to let your mind reset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree but if your goal is to socialize more, it's not enough to get off social media. You need to be in a place where enough other people do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of a city as both a spatial and a temporal grouping of people that are in the same place at a same time. Every hour a person spends at home on social media is an hour that they aren't really in the city and are not available for you to socialize with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cumulative hours that people spend staring at their phones are effectively a massive loss of population density. That lost density makes it harder to find people even if you yourself are getting off a screen and looking for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought of this the other day. I was on the train ride back from Chicago, and there was a family of four adults, sitting across from me, all just staring at their phones. I was effectively alone at that point in time. None of them were present. But you explained it in a new way I had not thought of before. They're quite literally not there in that moment, for however long that moment lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Now, everyone is an internet addict, and I was just ahead of the curve. No one hangs around and chats anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of the events and spaces I go to have people who hang around and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree that internet use has had an impact, but I think it's easy to underestimate how much situations change as you grow up. Now that I have kids, it seems like we're always ending up in spaces where people are hanging out and chatting. As far as my kids know, that's just the way the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought the same up through college, then I graduated and suddenly spontaneous socialization ended. I had to change my habits to go find other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet this looks very different from what 40+ years back looked like for adults so it's not just about growing up, there was other massive changes in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example the number of kids we had in the past dramatically affected 'forced' socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post war suburbanization that forced us to spend huge amounts of time on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things like TV that took entertainment from a group activity to a single person event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are seeking multiple things on social media. One common one is connection. I am in Mexico dealing with family business. I am in a rural area. My Spanish skills are developing but are still weak. I can have light conversation here, but I can't deeply connect. My desire to use social media has drastically increased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I only want to engage with my friends. Every platform feeds me various flavors of rage bait mixed in with my friends' content. Some of my friends groups have moved to chats on other less public platforms like Discord, Signal, or Whatsapp. But that's not the same experience. And a lot of the people I like to engage with aren't moving over to those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all thought maybe social media would evolve into something good... but it was enshitified. So maybe part of the solution here is to develop a tool that offers that connection without the whole being exploited aspect?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the feeling but my impression is that interacting with people that are strictly internet friends is a proxy to the real thing, the same way watching porn is a proxy for the real thing. When you spend X hours talking to people on the Internet you're spending at least less X hours talking to people IRL and building the sense of community that we now feel thinning away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know people that are internet famous and are terminally online all the time. I'm pretty sure it must feel like they're accomplishing something but for somebody IRL not familiar with the game they're playing their life looks very weird socially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current mindset for this is that social media should only work augmenting my real world social life, not take what's left of it away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; (unwalkable towns where all of the houses are big garages in the front and no porches)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can turn the garage into a hangout spot. A neighbor has a full bar with communal table plus TV for sports and he opens up the garage door once a week on a schedule (Sunday game day or whatever depending on the season) and whenever he feels like it on work week evenings. As people pass by we invite them over and after a few months everyone knows that when the garage is open, they can come over for a drink and to shoot the shit. Low pressure social interactions that often turn into weekend outings, regular poker games, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now years later we get impromptu block parties when he brings out the grill onto the driveway. It’s done wonders for our community in an otherwise unwalkable SoCal suburb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common retort is that these don't exist any more, but in my experience they're all over. If you have kids you start seeing them everywhere, too. They're not as classically romantic as an ancient Greek agora, but there are plenty of spaces. During the summer I'm probably at a different space 5 days a week with the kids after school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the real problem is that some people forget how to go places. It's so easy to do the routine of work -&amp;gt; dinner -&amp;gt; screen time -&amp;gt; sleep -&amp;gt; repeat that time vanishes from people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear people, usually young and single, complain that their 8 hour job leaves 0 hours in the day to do anything and they're too tired on the weekends to go out, it's always this: Their time is disappearing into their screens, which makes it feel like their only waking hours go to work. I try to give gentle nudges to help give people ideas, but none of them really want to hear that it's something they can change. It's just so easy to believe that life has thrust this situation upon us and there's nothing we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, people forgot how to find places. If you're driving a car, places speed by too fast to see or remember (and it's dangerous to spend too much time looking at them). On Google, places are actively hidden from you for the sake of making the map look "cleaner". Every time I go downtown (on transit, not by car) I notice new shit that just doesn't exist on the map unless you specifically type in the name to get Google to admit that it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No it doesn't. I live in a planned neighborhood in the suburbs. I can walk to a branch of my local library, a few restaurants, a bar, a bookstore, I even get my haircut in my neighborhood. And even if none of that existed, nothing has stopped me from being friends with my neighbors, or the parents of my kid's friends. The suburbs are a different model with tradeoffs, but they're also useful for periods and phases of life different from the ones served by urban settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This. I also like the idea of libraries having a cafe, internet access, a place to meet, all non profit and owned by the community. Community is a function of distance, broadly speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suburban sprawl is not going to be "fixed" in anyones lifetime. But it doesn't have to be limiting. I grew up in a very typical suburban style neighborhood in the 1970s. Tract homes, lots of cul-de-sac streets. But neighbors talked to one another, kids played together, there were summer gatherings in those cul-de-sacs on the 4th of July or Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't think you have to live in some idealized fantasy land to go talk to your neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in a suburban neighborhood with a couple bag ends, our neighborhood is pretty social. couple of neighborhood bbqs a year, kids all playing together every day, dinners, etc. It is quiet and not a lot of traffic with long term residents. I am not 100% on what exactly the key is for a town is, I think style matters, but Ive been in walkable neighborhoods without a good community, and non-walkable neighborhoods with one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll say that when I was a kid, the neighborhood was still as it was originally built, no sidewalks. Didn't stop anyone from socializing, didn't stop kids from biking around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city added sidewalks there in the '00s or so, but when I go back there I almost never see anyone using them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the trend of isolation and loneliness is not really related to infrastructure or stuff like "walkability." Those things are pretty minor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, many (most?) countries have most of their people living in places that are not sprawling suburbs. It's worst in the "Anglosphere" countries (US/Canada/Australia) within the last 50-70 years, but it's absolutely not a fantasy land. It's the way things were everywhere before 1940, and most places still are today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say that because it is fixable, if we let ourselves fix it...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your point stands though, even in a fairly antisocial layout of a suburb, you can still usually make friends with a decent number of people nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our lopsided emphasis on individualism, our definition of economic efficiency that does not include the psychological value, has been detrimental to our connections, roots, community, family etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We said, let the mom and pop stores die, their replacements provide the same value but more efficiently. Let community bonds die they intrude upon the individual destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we did not quite account for the value of what we chose to replace all that correctly. So it is not surprising that we find ourselves here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it have played out any other way ? I doubt it. Our world is underdamped, so we will keep swinging towards the extremes, till we figure out how to get a critically damped system. The other serious problem is that feedback system is so laggy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; People need to purposefully and intentionally do things. Sitting home on an app, watching TV is easy. There is no fear or rejection, there is no work to get out of the house, there is no risk. But there is also no reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the wrong model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting (alone) at home and working on program code or reading scientific textbooks does have a reward. Many things for which you go outside of the house or where you interact with other people have a much lower reward. So you rather loose a rather decent local optimum, and if you don't know very well where to look outside for something really good, you get much worse results than if you simply stayed at home and do there what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think by "reward" in the context of this discussion on loneliness, OP may have meant the opportunity to meet people, make friends, perhaps hit it off with someone and land a date, if you're single. Not that it's entirely useless/detrimental to spend time at home reading or pursuing whatever solo hobbies you happen to have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, there certainly are many introverts who are perfectly happy on their own with no need to get out and meet people. More power to them! But there are many that crave human connection, even if they happen to have many intellectual interests and for these types of individuals, they would be well served at least carving out some portion of their time to get out of the house with the explicit aim of meeting people. And yes, not every such outing will lead to lifelong friends or meeting your next soulmate, but it's a numbers game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; you get much worse results than if you simply stayed at home and do there what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a sense of risk and caution that gets too comfortable for some people to compete with over time. If you don't build yourself better options, all you want to do is sit at home and do the thing that guarantees a reward. Then you get in your car and move about the world in a way that you feel is guaranteed to protect you from conditions, other people, but really is dangerous. You bet only on certainty, and outcomes are predictable, but they're not compatible with not being lonely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, but what about the people who don't do this? Those who sit at home all day, scrolling away, drinking themselves to death, wondering why life is so lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only time you ever see such people is when they're walking to the grocery store. How do you reach out to them to let them know about these ideas or encourage them to try it? Especially when they're filled with discouraging thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if all they need is one single person to say hi? How can I find them, reach them? This is what I'm asking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need the Tiktoks of the world to realize their responsibility: users get addicted to the apps in order to numb their feelings of loneliness. So we'd need an intervention within these apps that makes them unbearable for the lonely, combined with a healthier way to engage with loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine TikTok asking you "you've scrolled for 30 minutes. You might be in a loneliness spiral. Write down the name of someone you would like to be closer to."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok does in fact remind you, quite often, that you've been scrolling for a while, and suggests taking a break. Last year, for most of each day, I would just ignore this and keep scrolling. I'd see it so many times each day. That wouldn't change if they added a suggestion like writing a name down. I'd still ignore it, and I think most people in the same situation would too. But when I was at the store, or walking to the store, that's when someone could have found a way in, and been able to get me to make a connection and open up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just have to become the most friendly ultimate host in the world. Start up random conversations with those people at the grocery store or on the street and invite them to your bbq you are having this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, if a man is sitting in his kitchen and its on fire. Its up to him to run out. No amount of reaching out will help until he decides to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A somewhat cynical response given the frequency of this topic/question being posted here and on other social media platforms. Add a weak "/s but not really" if you want:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People sitting at home living on apps and watching TV who decide to go to a new group social event to change things up will struggle to make a connection with someone else who was at home on an app and watching TV deciding to get out and meet someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who have friends.. already have friends. Those who don't are numerous social cycle iterations in on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how long before those people just end up talking about TV shows anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience, this is the key. “90% of life is showing up.” If you are around the same people every week, for whatever reason, with even a minimal amount of openness and friendliness, you will get community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sure. I would have been in real trouble if covid had happened when I was 20. The few times I tried to work remotely it took a matter of just a few days to go stir crazy. The office was a good environment for me (it helped that it was legitimately a good environment with good coworkers, not everyone has that).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a family man with a wife, two kids, two cats, and a dog ... working from home is no big deal for me now. I prefer it. I got lucky that we did not get forced into this until I was in a position to handle it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is true, it's worth mentioning that a regular coffee machine small talk in the office is not building any relationships. At least that's how I experience it. It can start one, but won't automatically make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can go for a coffee and routinely get dragged into 30 min conversation about politics, or cars, or weather, or any other subject I literally don't care about. All the good relationships begin with finding a niche topic between 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with this take. I'm definitely not friends with everyone I've worked with in person, but some of the most meaningful post-college friendships were formed by socializing with the people in the office (or people I met through socializing with office friends).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, I met my wife at an office party - she didn't work for the company, just stopped by with someone who did&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And not just the office friends that come from it -- I spent an hour a day on the bus, grabbed lunch around town, was downtown when work wrapped up and ended up at a nearby bar/restaurant, went to shows because I was downtown, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just being forced out of the house led to SO MUCH MORE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I work from home and while we do travel a lot, we barely ever leave the house when we're home. We didn't make a single new friend for like 5 years (and we are a VERY social couple, generally the center of most of our friend groups). We've only just now started making new friends again now that our daughter is a toddler and getting us out of the house -- and it is incredibly refreshing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This as well. You need to learn to talk to people, socialize, handle adversity, etc. Sitting at home and your only real connection to the outside world being an echo chamber like facebook or whatever cannot be good for us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely, I agree. Some of the people I had the sharpest debates with and didn't always agree with had way more impact on who I am today than the softer acquaintances. Most of them definitely made me a better person in the end, even if we weren't really "friends".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yeah, even just having the basic daily connections can be a dopamine hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is good advice for your friends and family, but a bad answer to the question. "How can we solve the obesity epidemic? Stop eating so much and get some exercise." Well sure, but this misses the big picture. We built a social infrastructure that encourages a sedentary, solitary life. We shouldn't be confused by physical and emotional health implications. We can expect some people to be proactive about it, but we can't expect that of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think what makes this good advice especially difficult is that it cannot be one-sided. When everyone is letting doom-scrolling replace their social interaction, then one person won't easily solve their own problem by going out to socialize. We need a broader solution, probably a cultural shift away from using technology as a crutch to avoid other people. Maybe the current younger generations will evolve a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, for years now I’ve had this creeping feeling that it’s a social version of the prisoners dilemma: if you’re the only one that puts down the phone (or gets off social media, etc) then you’re just left behind. It’s a coordination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that there are a lot of people that are kind of waiting for other people to pitch something to do. Maybe you want to call them type A and B, leader and follower, I think of it as the Host and Attendees. The more of the Hosts the more things that will be happening, so trying to become a Host is just creates more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agreed. I'm not sure how it happened, but it feels like we've experienced a societal shift where a large number of people now expect and wait for other people to create nicely packaged solutions to their (real or imagined) problems. From social apps to medicine to play dates to curated vacations, too many people are unwilling to face "the great unknown" that is just going out and seeing what happens, warts and all. Somehow the ability of boomers to make conversation with strangers has become a meme instead of a norm - they're good at it because they practice it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. fair 2. did this but they are all 80+ 3. ok 4. not that good at anything, too old for most groups. gym no one talks with anyone. bjj was the best for this, since its more older and mostly men 5. remote work ruined my mental health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as 2 goes: As far as churches go. The type of church matters a lot. If you go to a Universalist Unitarian, or progressive Lutheran Church, yeah itll probably be 80+. Evangelical/Baptist, Latter Day Saints, Orthodox, Catholic (more traditional parishes) all are significantly younger. The more conservative the denomination the younger the congregation. The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture. This also tracks to Judaism, with Reformed Synagogues being much older than Orthodox. I am not sure and haven't seen numbers of Islam, Buddhism, etc. i the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 4: You don't really have to be good for like a rec league kickball, or beer league golf. Gyms are better if youre doing classes though I think, like BJJ or wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experience is similar. I think there is a combination of "some gyms are more social" and "some people are good at breaking the ice with strangers". On social media, I frequently hear people say stuff like: "Oh yeah, I have a bunch of friends at the gym." I am not doubting their story, but it doesn't happen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; remote work ruined my mental health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sorry to hear it. I'm not here to start a holy war about remote work. Can you share some details? For me, remote work has me very quickly "falling apart" -- showering at 2PM or not at all. Going to the office forces some structure into my life and everything else flows from that. To be clear: I understand that a lot of people love remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; "Oh yeah, I have a bunch of friends at the gym."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their definition of "a friend" can wildly vary from yours. Especially if such relationship is cultivated only at the gym. I'd hardly call it "friendship".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also in this group, so I have a few theories as to what causes it and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one thing, I was severely traumatized as a kid, which delayed a lot of my social skills. I'm catching up but not all the way there yet. When my social battery is full, I can do pretty well, but if I'm even a little down, it's basically impossible to act normally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well I've started doing public surveys in my nearby big city, and documenting the results. I just hold out a posterboard that says "how alone do you feel"[1] or "have you ever been in love" etc, and hold out a marker, and people come up and take the survey. At first I did this out of sheer loneliness and boredom. But I have done it for enough months that some people have come up to me and told me that I've helped them, or that they look forward to my signs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I was a small child, my grandfather used to beat me savagely and shake me and pin me to the ground, screaming that the devil was inside of me and that I would never be capable of loving or being loved. This was literally beaten into me. He'd beat me with the buckle end of the belt, like a whip, hitting my face, arms, whatever he could. He'd keep beating me until I couldn't cry anymore, telling me that men are not supposed to cry, and that it was his responsibility to teach me not to cry. I flashback at least once a day to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, he was wrong. I love a lot. So much that sometimes it's unbearable. I cry all the time. Sometimes out of pure love for someone. And there are people who I think love me. Of course the doubt is permanently sewn in. But my heart goes out to you, seriously. I love you just for existing and being yourself, and I hope you're okay. We're not alone. Email's in my bio if you ever want to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traumatic childhood almost always messes with how one attaches with people. Some, remain unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When attachment styles are warped, behaviors that were once upon a time a self protection behavior becomes a self-defeating behavior in adult life. The person is quite oblivious of all this because those behaviors and fragile modes of attachment feel perfectly normal. It feels like - I am right, it's the others who are wrong, unfair, greedy, flakey, stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me this book [0] was very helpful for understanding what's going on in and around me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've posted this thought a few times in different ways, but in my experience, community is found and then built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regularly sharing space with others is the way to start finding community. I think your surveying is an example of that. The next step is when the interactions begin taking place outside of the regular time/place, as evidenced by your epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I haven't posted before is anything about how to successfully create those connections. Maybe we get lucky and someone will share our taste in music or movies or what have you, and the connection will be almost effortless. But to increase the rate of connection, I've found that learning to ask good questions is key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from popular interviewers like Terry Gross, Johnny Carson, or James Lipton. But to provide some direct tips: Lead with open-ended questions (i.e. not "yes or no"). Ask follow-up questions. Share a little bit while asking questions (e.g. "I'm not really into X music, more Y. Where would I start if I wanted to listen to X?")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, sometimes friendships just aren't meant to be. It's tough, and can feel like a waste of time to have made the connection, but I've been surprised multiple times when a conversation that seemed like a slog of a one-off led to fruitful friendships later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like this poster thing. Anything that gives people a little connection to those around them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sometimes sit on my front step and play guitar. 9/10 people ignore me but usually I'll have one or two nice conversations with a neighbor, and have made a couple friends this way. It helps that I live in a dense walkable place with lots of people who are similar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helping people like you are seems like an amazing start. Maybe try to get a pyramid structure going where you teach people to help other people and then they teach people and then it’s a movement? But at all times a low level of effort so there is no pressure other than just holding up a sign or a marker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found the hardest thing is breaking the ice and the sign / marker normalises a low stakes interaction where one participant can walk away at any time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a twofold problem, I believe. People are lonely because of fear of rejection and also actively avoid new people out of caution and high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So two people who are otherwise lonely will make no effort to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think social networks have done a tremendous amount of damage to our collective psyche. Because on the web, you can single-click permanently block someone and never see them again. If you are admin of a group this person is in, you can also ban this person and prevent them from interacting with members of the group (in the group, that is, you cannot control private messages, but by banning someone from a community you are effectively isolating them), and I think we haven't considered how much power we are giving to random Reddit mods due to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intentionally choose community and the effort it takes to build and cultivate it [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. People are work, but you cannot live without community [6].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why, you ask? Because your comment seemed like you had read only the title and nothing else I wrote here, and wanted to contribute off the cuff links you had stored up. And you barely even bothered to summarize any of what they contain. I've been reading this book by Dr. Vivek Hallegere Murthy ever since you linked it, and it's definitely got some great insights into it, that mirror my own thoughts and struggles with this. But in your comment, it felt like a mere afterthought. And maybe that's fine, maybe that's fair, you're a busy guy and have your own stuff to do. It's not against the rules or general moral code to write a drive by comment. But it just feels like a low effort comment. Which is why I wanted to downvote it. And now that it's surfaced higher than mine, it just feels like pouring lemon juice on a papercut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you serious right now? I don't mean this in an insulting way at all, but I can see why you're dealing with loneliness. Take some time to self reflect and figure out why you lashed out here(seriously, really think about it or show some friends this dialogue without context and ask what they think, in person). Like the commenter, I hope you find you find your community, but you are far from the path. Your attitude is fixable, nobody is playing down the problems here and instead people who were in your shoes empathetically showed you a way out, but you need some serious self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case it's not clear, original replier's comment here is absolutely correct and it doesn't necessarily have to be in a religious pretext (re: the church article), that's just a palpable example for most people. Neighbors, community centers, hobbies, etc-- these all require work on everybody's end and you must commit to these relationships to create a semblance of something to revolve your life around in lieu of drowning in loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sure, my church citation wasn't about religion specifically, but that the decline in third spaces in general and a lack of community can be directly connected to early deaths and deaths of despair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Church does not have to be a church of faith, it can well be a church of reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What matters is that people with shared values get to spend time together on a regular basis without getting into status games that might eventually show up no matter what the church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You asked how to solve the loneliness epidemic. I provided citations and recommendations. Are you asking me how to be the person you need to be to make bids for friendship and connectivity to establish community? And where to find people you can have an opportunity to make connections with? I can do that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go out and find people looking for other people. Volunteer and find events and gatherings scoped to building connections between people. Third spaces are in decline [1] [2], or in some places, non existent. This will be work. It will not be easy. You will need to work on managing the feelings of rejection and shallow people not genuinely interested in you or building a friendship (boundaries are important in this regard; have them, communicate them, and enforce them). Success is not assured. But your only choices are to try or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From your comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In regards to this you commented, I highly recommend therapy if you can access it. It will help. This is an unnecessary burden to be carrying through adult life, and a professional might help unburden you of these feelings. The healthier you are emotionally, the easier it will be to create and maintain interpersonal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does all of this suck? Oh yes, certainly. But we play the hand we're dealt to the best of our ability. Good luck, in as genuine terms as I can communicate in text. If you feel like I can provide more value with more questions you might have, I will do my best to help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(tangentially, I recommend replacing "idiot who doesn't understand anything" with something more like "I am early in my journey to understand, but I look forward to the experience"; love yourself first, we are all learning and sharing for the portion of the timeline we share, and it is okay to not know if we continue to want and try to learn)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree you (OP) must work on developing a positive view of yourself. Maybe therapy. Don't overlook clergy even if you're not religious. Religion is as much about fellowship and how to live a fulfilling life as it is about worship. Some churches (e.g. unitarian) are quite inclusive and are much more spiritual than dogmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you will find it much harder to attract friendships if you come across as needy or wanting to unburden a lifetime of problems on your new prospective friend. Not to say a longtime friend can't eventually handle some of this, but it's not a good way to start off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say avoid groups that are focused on personal success or networking. These tend to be full of people who are looking for an angle or benefit for themselves, not people genuinely trying to develop friendships and connections with a community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In regards to this you commented, I highly recommend therapy if you can access it. It will help. This is an unnecessary burden to be carrying through adult life, and a professional might help unburden you of these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not the GP, but I have the same experience to them. I have been in therapy and on psychotropic medication my entire adult life, that's 2.5 decades. I'd love to know when exactly the "unburdening of these feelings" happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd like to assert here that "community" can exist online as well. It's not just people staying indoors; it's about how they interact with what others write and whether they even care that another person wrote it. It's about things like coming to recognize usernames and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, LLM generated content threatens that, so things have gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the replies so far are suggesting ideas for an individual but seem to be missing the real crux of the matter...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, you'll be less lonely if you join a group, get out of your house, etc... But how do we actively incentivize that? Social media and whatnot have hundreds of thousands of people working around the clock to find ways to suck you in and monopolize your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While "everyone should recognize the problem and then take steps to solve it for themselves" is the obvious solution, it's also not practical to just have everyone collectively decide they need to get out more without SOME sort of fundamental change in our society/incentives/etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data from various studies, including those from academic institutions and public health organisations, supports the idea that regular church attendance helps reduce loneliness by fostering social connections, support networks, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been going to a church half a year now, and the sense of community is amazing, made new friends and know more people I could dream of. So there is a way, there is a light. Never felt lonely again since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, I tried that a few years ago. It worked for a while. Then I realized that my church relationships were paper thin and that I'd be forgotten the day I stopped coming and/or I started showing that I didn't really believe in what was preached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got better connections through improv acting and role-playing game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm no fan of religion, but the situation you described is true for pretty much all social hobbies. It's just one of the early steps in making friends. First you do stuff, then you meet people through that stuff forming acquaintances. Then you spend some time forming setting-specific friendships. It's fine to have lots of these, but the next step is to break out of that specific setting. Starting with immediate invitations to adjacent events ("Hey, want to grab dinner after our workout?", "Want to grab lunch after church?", "Hey, want to hit the bar after work?"). Once you have a habit of doing that, you can escalate to invitations to non-adjacent events. ("Want to go to a concert this weekend?"). Do that ever 1-2 months, and you've got a general friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've entertained the idea of going to church. My understanding is that a non-trivial number of people going to Unitarian Universalist churches are openly atheist and completely comfortable with that. So the preaching ends up being more about general good community ideas and less about dogma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have not decided yet that it is a good fit, but I am definitely thinking that I should foster some community connections outside of my own family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s possibly useful on an individual level, but not a solution. If existing institutions didn’t solve loneliness yet they aren’t going to without changing something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting church attendance might help, but so would any number of group activities the issue is why that stuff is in decline not that stuff not working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; supports the idea that regular church attendance helps reduce loneliness by fostering social connections, support networks, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correlation does not establish causation. Regular church attendance dominantly occurs among people who have shared values (clustered around what the church teaches); that doesn't imply that an outsider can just choose to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have a full answer, but a couple thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Volunteer. Somewhere, anywhere, for a good cause, for a selfish cause. Somebody will be happy to see you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Stop trolling ourselves. As far as I can tell, all of the mass social media is trending sharply towards being a 100% troll mill. The things people say on social media do not reflect genuine beliefs of any significant percentage of the population, but if we continue to use social media this way, it will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disengage from all of the trolls, including and especially the ones on your "own side".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; the mass social media is trending sharply towards being a 100% troll mill&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree. It's one reason I still come to HN and it's one of the few places I bother to comment (and the only place with more than a few dozen users). The moderation and community culture against trolling makes it a generally positive experience. I do still need breaks sometimes, though, for a few months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd love an online community where everyone was having discussions only in good faith. Zero trolling. I can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would also argue that even people who I like a lot and have known for many years can be very different "people" online than in person. It's sometimes shocking the dichotomy. I try to remind myself and others to ignore some of the online weirdness and focus on the in person interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever else you think of Bluesky, it's a place where trolling and doomerism are rejected. The nuclear block (and a culture of block, don't engage) does wonders for denying actual trolls an audience, and secondarily for permitting people to do the virtual equivalent of walking away from someone who's behaving badly. In particular, doomerism about Trump is minimized there the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; So they sit on social media all day when they're not at work or school. How can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The naive solution is to place blame on the people who are influenced by the most advanced behavior modification schemes ever devised by humans. Kinda like how the plastic producers will push recycling, knowing they can shift blame for the pollution away from their production of the pollution, because people love blaming. You'll see commenters here telling us that the answer is for people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, get out, get involved in their communities under their own willpower. These ideas are doomed from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real solution is already being enacted in a number of US states and countries[1]: legally restricting access to the poison, rather than blaming the people who are at the mercy of finely honed instruments of behavior modification when they're unable to stop drinking it under their own willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking something away by force is not the way to encourage someone to do something else. This is carrot or stick mentality. The city added benches and chairs in all the parks to improve the quality of our third spaces, as an example of social infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s all about fostering community again, and that’s more than just shared calendars and town events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s “third places” where folks can just hang out and work, play, share, and commiserate without having to pay money to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s bringing back establishments that promote lingering and loitering, like food halls or coffee shops, rather than chasing out folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s about building community centers inside apartment complexes, more public green space, more venues and forums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giving people space that doesn’t require a form of payment is the best approach, because humans will take advantage of what’s out there naturally. Sure, structure helps, but space is the issue at present I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a fear of crowds and bums. Not where I'm paralyzed/medicated but one thing I'm trying to do is go downtown and do street photography. I wonder how do I say no to a stranger asking me for money. Or fear of getting robbed. It's not like my camera gear is that expensive but yeah. This would push me to get out there more as I've lived in the same place for 10 yrs and I haven't really explored/gone around much. Other than when I did Uber Eats, I would go all over the place. I would get wasted/drink at bars but end up with nothing end of the day, temporary day-long friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funny I was at the gym yesterday, guy said hello to me, as a guy that keeps to himself usually (unless around friends) I gave him a bad look (not on purpose) and then I responded. I'll say hello next time I see him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah for me it's just fear and lack of exposure. I do make a lot of "work friends" go on walks. But yeah real friends I think I have 4 or 5 lifelong real friends. Women nothing, haven't been laid in like 12 years pretty said to say. Unfortunately it's something I value myself like "I'm a loser by not getting laid". Even though rest of my life is good, 2BR apt, sporty car, six-fig job, but yeah. It's my social awkardness, but I lift/improve myself, cutting down on weight I want abs. Idk I'm not going after women anymore either just trying to live life now, do shit, get out of debt, get out of 9-5, mental freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's funny if it's guys I'm very "charismatic" like I can be "everyone's friend" which doesn't work out due to conflicting interest. To that end it's really about taking an active interest in the other person, engaging them, asking them questions and remembering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My thing with women is I don't get along with them like a guy (where I don't want anything from them physically). If they're not attractive then it's easier to talk to them but yeah, I guess that comes from a desperation mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hear me out. Its not just social awkwardness. You're experiencing class boundaries and do not seem to have the right mentality to bridge the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you call homeless people bums, which sets the stage for how you see and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an excellent engineer, but I was abused and impoverished as a child, homeless as a teenager. During my 20s, I started a few companies but my savings have been continually depleted taking care of family members. I don't have a sports car or a big bank account, or nice cameras. When I see a stranger or homeless person, I smile and wave. I keep cash on me so that I always have some to give out. I buy people lunch and sit on the curb eating with them and attempting to understand them. I learn the names of my local homeless folk and ingratiate myself in the community. I've moved to a few cities so I've had the opportunity to do this a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't do this because I lack social anxiety; I sometimes have extreme agoraphobia, to the point that I have to hype myself up for hours just to go to the grocery store, and I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones to reduce the amount of stimulation. I have PTSD. I'm an extreme introvert. A hermit at times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what saves me is the philosophical understanding that I have a duty to the social contract. That empathy and direct aid are nonnegotiable parts of being human. I've been homeless and I know what it's like to be truly hopeless and live a life of uncertainty, fear and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to bridge that gap. Class-induced anxiety is real and I acknowledge that it's probably difficult, but it's not an excuse. You sound like you're in a position to change someone's life. Taking those steps might change your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's funny there was a moment I was at a bus station, somebody asked me for money and I dumped all the coins I had in my wallet in their hand for future bus rides. And some lady comes up to me jokingly like "you handing money out? what about me".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But yeah I think I should just give the money out, I think aside from the guy at the red light that's there almost everyday when it's warm, it's rare I encounter somebody personally. Until I go into the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy someone new clothes. A sleeping bag. Utensils. A library card or bus pass. If it has to be cash, you don't have to stop at $5. I sometimes give out tens and twenties. Obviously at a place like California your altruism can be spread pretty thin; just ignore the people who are more difficult / less appreciative. Find someone who is appreciative. Get to know them and find out what is holding them back. Maybe you can't help, maybe you can. I've had people tell me I've made their day, their week, their year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's that thing though I'm pretty sure I was scammed by this couple at a gas station asking me for "gas money" even though they wanted cash then the lady said "your mother raised a good boy" lmao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me this is a gov problem not an individual problem. Yeah if someone was dying in front of me I would try to help them. But now I gotta go to a store and buy em a tent and what not? I guess I am an asshole. Also read up "do you give money to homeless" on reddit. Almost all of the answers are no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to go there and face my fear. See if I do get assaulted, I'm a 6ft buff dude so I don't think so but I'm also not a trained fighter. I just hate this fear, that normal people like living in NYC deal with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting jumped is real though, I've been jumped before by a group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Might as well just give the $5 though and move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back to women, I have negative traits as demonstrated above, indecisiveness and low self-esteem/caring about what other people think of me too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I found after many years, is that women (people in general, really) are not attracted to people who try too hard to get attention from them. Going through great lengths tends to result in being labeled as desperate or creepy. Try just to be friendly and talk "with" them and not "to" them, almost as if you are one of them. By doing that often enough, it will feel less awkward. Practice makes perfect. And then one day you feel a click with someone. Just my few cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah that's the cliche saying, let them chase you or don't put on a pedestal. Idk not sure if it's because I was raised by women that I need their approval (no male figure). But I know other people who were in the same situation and aren't like me so it must be a personal choice/way you decide to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found it uncomfortable as a kid when I saw how my parents handled begging: ignoring it. I remember one time my father saying "that's ok". And I either say "no, sorry" or ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've heard of kids from cities being given money so they always have something to give a mugger instead of looking like you're holding out, I don't go that far but I remember it to keep perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently made an effort to carry cash with me so I can leave tips in cash, still working on that. Would you be open to keeping singles on you to give? You can even give max of one per excursion and then decline or ignore the rest or any combination but maybe having that as a plan can help you feel comfortable. Yes you're training yourself and it's because you deserve the benefits of training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for non-bums hello is good, also fist bumps and nodding upwards; that stuff is cool AF and make people so damn happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah it's funny I'll sound like I'm virtue signaling here, I donate. Food groups, NHA, stuff like that. Where I live there's usually a person at a red light waiting to "ambush" you. Same at a grocery store, soon as you exit the door solicitors going "excuse me sir".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But yeah it would be easy to just have a $5 to hand out. It's just you know how many people are there and will it stop there kind of thing. Yeah I sound like an asshole I get it. I also have sent over $100K to my own family in support and I'm -$80K in debt so it's not like I'm hoarding my money or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It just annoys me. But sure it'll be easier to just say "here you go" and hand out cash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience a few times people will ask for money if they see you giving someone else something, but not that often, and you can shrug through it and say that was your last dollar or something. Keep the interactions short and easy and try to carry the loose bills outside of your wallet so no one can actually see how much you have inside it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly one time after I did this, a guy asked me to send something to his venmo since I really only had a dollar. Probably my strangest interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I'll probably be smart and just empty my wallet except ID and some loose cash. I just don't like it the idea someone coming up to you asking you for money and you're expected to just do it, give it to them. It's funny too as soon as they get what they want or don't get what they want, they're like f you and move on. Ahh well I just wish I didn't care. I'm too soft/care what other people think of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like points on a website "oh no I got downvoted", there's a thing as being you/not being a conformist&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I purposefully need to get into a fight you know overcome it, like expect anyone who comes up to me to fight me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't sound like an asshole because you aren't saying bad things about the people who have the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's up to you, you can just, to yourself, write down the words you'll use to write down that you'll ignore them to become more comfortable with your boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I don't think handing out cash is helpful so it's not about charity it's my advice to pre-plan how you'll respond to be more comfortable than you are in reaction to these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a quick escape though to be like "here you go" and move on but also opens you up to "that's it?" I've had that happen even when I said "I don't have cash" well I have Venmo I'm like alright... yeah I don't want to have this mindset but also can't be naive too kumbaya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing legal again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having barely room for little more than a bed forces you to get out during the day. Stuff happens when your default for where to spend your time is not at "home". SRO halls also usually had more room for common spaces to meet and socialize with other people in a similar position in life, and of course, SRO is a very cheap housing option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a basketball app to bring people together. Basketball was invented out of grief, by James Naismith who lost his grandfather, mother, father, and family home to a fire within 4 months. He was tasked with helping to have rambunctious youth learn the principles of teamwork and sharing and slowing down and thus created the game. It truly brings people together and I hope everyone gets a chance to experience the magic that is pickup basketball. It got me out of a deep hole after the pandemic after my mom had passed and I gained 30 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one is asking for this advice, but I'm sharing it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My #1 top priority this year is _social health_. I'm taking it into my own hands. Mostly just continuing things I'm already doing with tremendous payoff. My measurable result is going to be throwing my own birthday party in fall. I've never done that before, I've never had enough friends in my city!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one group or app is going to come save you from loneliness. You have to get up, go outside, and find people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0. Say yes to everything, at least if you're new in town. Don't care how scared you are of X social situation. "Do it scared" - @jxnl&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. I am part of my community's swing dancing scene. I take classes, go to social dances, I _show up_ even when I don't feel like it. People recognize me now, know my name, etc. I'm also a regular at my gym. Find a place and be a regular face there. (_how did I become a swing dancer? I got invited, and my social policy prevented me from saying no!_)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. If I have no social plans for a week I do a timeleft dinner (dinner with 5 strangers). Always have something on the books. I call this my "social workout". If I vibe with anyone I ask if they want to grab ramen the following weekend. Leads me to point #3..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Initiate plans. Everyone is waiting for that text "hey, want to go do x with me?". Be that person. I have an almost 100% enthusiastic response rate to asking people to do literally anything. Go on a random walk? Go to costco? Go checkout ramen or pizza spot? You don't have to think of anything special. Whatever you're already doing.. ask someone to come with! Soon they start inviting you to do random stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. (experimental) I don't drink, which does curtail my social opportunities. I'm considering updating my drinking policy this year. My hypothesis is that the benefits of having a strong community out-weigh the health benefits of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 4. (experimental) I don't drink, which does curtail my social opportunities. I'm considering updating my drinking policy this year. My hypothesis is that the benefits of having a strong community out-weigh the health benefits of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very mature, balanced take. If I may advise: Try some experiments on yourself. You already know how you feel and how you socialise without drinking. Try drinking various amounts in different social settings. How does it feel? Do you like yourself and your life more before? Then go back. Else, continue experimenting until you find a sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The causes are deeply structural. It won't be solved any time soon. There's really not much political will. We're talking about the fundamental organization of modern society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was addicted to weed from ages 15-23. I have clinical depression and anxiety/OCD (now medicated and stable). I basically isolated and got stuck in a loop of believing I was broken and a bad person. When I committed to quitting I joined addiction recovery groups and asked for help instead of trying to do it alone. I still rely on the wisdom I gained in AA/MA. Trust God, clean house, help others, go do something when you are in danger of wallowing in self pity. 4 years later, I have a few real friends and many acquaintances. I swing dance and volunteer. I work in a semi-social office. Life is good. I still get paranoid thoughts, but they don't own or define me. I wish the best to all the lonely programmers and alienated people out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have young boys in your life then teach them that it's ok to feel and express their emotions, and as they get older that their sexual self need not be frightening and that sex can exist outside of narratives of domination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; that their sexual self need not be frightening and that sex can exist outside of narratives of domination&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes a ton of sense but the language needs so much work here to be digested into a real conversation by your average parent, let alone preteen/teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This requires them to have spaces where they can express themselves sexually without the fear that male sexuality will be judged as inherently violent or oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've lost count of the times I've seen women praised while men were castigated, in the same space, for expressing any kind of honest sexual preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote an article[0] on Tiny Neighborhoods (aka “Cohousing”) that starts with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; “I often wonder if the standard approach to housing is the best we can do. About 70% of Americans live in a suburb, which means that this design pattern affects our lives – where we shop, how we eat, who we know – more than any other part of modern life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have been so uncritical of the set of ideas that make suburbia—single family homes, one car per adult, large private yards—even though these play a big role in how people act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people want to address loneliness by making incremental changes. But if the statistics are right and nearly everyone is somewhat lonely, we should expect that the required adjustments feel “drastic” compared to the current norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People would be less lonely if they could live in a community of 15-20 families with (1) shared space and (2) shared expectations for working together on their shared space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted on another subthread but I think this is largely an excuse. If you live in a typical suburb you have 15-20 families on your street. You can easily walk next door and chat or just say hello when you see someone outside. It takes initiative, which is the key thing that's missing. You either hide in your house or you get out and be sociable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, whenever I felt lonely and hopeless, I jumped into helping others: volunteering, helping an old neighbor garden, help someone move, etc. Helping people gave me a short-term purpose, which eventually let me ride out the low phase of life. YMMV, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have noticed that doing the sign leads to some good conversations in which I've helped someone in a small way, and that gave me a nice little dopamine boost. It's also led to about half a dozen genuine friendships over the past few months. I wonder if that's the answer, a sort of meta-solution: organizing this thing I'm doing into something that other people in the same situation can do, as a way of meeting people and getting outside their comfort zone. Like setting up a chess table in public if chess is your thing. But no, there are already public chess tables, and they'd have already done that. I don't know, just thinking out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my go-to strategy as well. When I feel irrepressible bits of loneliness or depression, I just make some food and go out and start handing out to the needy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or go for a walk and find people that need a hand. People moving, lifting things, carrying things. Small little acts of being useful and helpful for a moment help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feeling will creep back in eventually, but at least for that time I was out and about, it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, of course, multiple causes for loneliness. We can't fix them all with one clear action. Here are the main five, in my view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, social media. It's too easy to temporarily forget about your loneliness by staying home and doomscrolling or watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, increased mobility. People move around the whole continent now for work, removing them from their closest and oldest social connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, God is dead. Churches as community centers are dying out. Young people don't trust them anymore, because they don't believe in God, and because churches had many scandals. Secular community centers are very rare and struggle with funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, work is more stressful now. There used to be more time to socialize, but in our quest for productivity, work became denser with fewer idle times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, fewer people want to have kids. Much has been written about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now what can we do at societal scale? First of all, study the phenomenon more closely. Who is lonely? Who isn't? Which interventions work? Which cultural factors are important? At your local scale, you can just call or meet a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll find virtually every dimension of your life will improve if you're on top of these four things. It will make you more ambitious in pursuing social engagement. And that will make socialization much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Pass a law letting people WFH where its reasonably possible. I WFH in a walkable city and me and my friends try new restaurants every week, always around noon. I've met lots of new people, and joined new groups that I wouldn't have found out about if I was stuck at my desk. Give people more freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common denominator is to have shared spaces where it's expected to be among strangers' presence, and for those strangers to eventually become repeat guests in a person's life. That's the maximally comfortable scenario for inducing social behavior and it's responsible for eons of human social history. Think church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem there is that it's the responsibility of groups or society to arrange that. There's not much that a single lonely person can do there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The less common denominator, that an individual may partake in until society concocts a better solution, is to intentionally visit existing shared spaces even where they otherwise wouldn't (hint: bouldering gyms are good for this because there are repeat faces as well as a social okay-ness to congratulating strangers, or asking how certain challenges can be solved).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or break with convention, comfort, and perhaps etiquette, and instead just talk to people. Even outside of those spaces. (This is the advice that will piss a lot of people off if it's presented as their only option.) This advice is horrible until it isn't. It does, with enough practice, 'just work'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an entrepreneur or organizer: it would just go a long way to think about things in terms of allowing conversation to happen unimpeded. Pay attention to where people talk, and about what. Conversations happen a lot in hallways but famously by water coolers, perhaps because it affords people enough time in a shared space to muster the internal capital to start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In college I ran a forum for people to meet others and some of the most self-reportedly successful participants just asked questions into the void and were surprised by the number of responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a mobile app that allows you to get a morning wake up call from a real person. Part of my motivation here was to help add a little human interaction to what is a lonely experience for some people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a difficult problem to want to solve. Some of it has to do with low income or joblessness. So this is the first focus I would set - make income easier to come by, more fair, more distributed. This in itself will not fix the solo state of people but it would alleviate some worries. Then we have to tackle the social problem. This is really difficult to want to solve. Activity helps, so the state should be able to encourage more activity overall. For instance, in my own youth I was physically more active, so you meet a lot of people through sports - that alone works fairly well. You can probably think of many more cohesive social structures and what not. I think it is a difficult to want to solve problem though. Not everyone uses social media by the way but is still isolated; Japan even gave some odd name to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I doubt we can solve this for other people. Each person must solve it for themselves, but for most people the solution will be joining a church and attending weekly. From there, get involved with a ministry, that will lead to appreciation dinners, which will lead to getting invited to the non-religous stuff the people are involved with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gap between thinking and action. I think the social media and gaming and online stimulions currently designed to bombard and drain your thinking brain, leaves nothing for the action you and your body needs to take. Your brain only has so much chemistry to trigger neural activation and we are blowing it on mental stress to the point where the body doesn’t have any more mental energy to tackle real world stress or handle real world emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try an A/B test. Do days with zero screen stimuli - no TV, no phones, no online interaction. Go into the world to a cafe, or a common area with people and do stuff. See how you feel and what you feel up to. Vacations might be good and relaxing because you disconnect. Maybe do it without paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sports. CrossFit and similar social sports have been healthy for me and for many others, and I think the community is at least equal to the exercise in improving people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not saying this is the only way, but it made a big difference for me and my friends. I realize the physical challenges are artificial, but so is an Advent of Code puzzle when you already have a day job. Hard things are worth doing because they're hard, and they're even better when done together with those you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anecdote: I had a friend in SF. He and I would hang out once in a while, and I always looked forward to these hangouts (we'd meet up for coffee, or go for a walk, hang out at Dolores Park, etc.). He is gay, I'm not. His perspective on things was often quite different than mine and I found that interesting. I got married, he stayed single. Even after marriage we would still hang out (though not as often as before). Then we had a child, which sucked all spare time out of my life; but even then we hung out once in a while. Then one winter there was cold/flu/COVID going around. We planned on hanging out and I unfortunately bailed on him at the last moment. This happened 2 more times. Then that bout of illnesses passed and I reached out to him to hang out again. But this time he seemed cold and distant. So I dropped it. And I didn't see him again for almost 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then one day I ran into him while walking through Dolores Park. He didn't see me, but I hesitated and still hollered out at him, for old times' sake. He responded and walked over. We chatted a little, I gave him a parting hug and we agreed to hang out again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later we managed to hang out again. What I gathered from our meeting was that he had been miffed at what he thought was me blowing him off; and I, when I felt he was cold and distant, had misread his grief at losing his cat. We both misread each other and wasted 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moral of the story that I took away from it was: be more forgiving. Friendships are worth the extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have considered a "physical social network". Standing on my usual street corner and holding a sign that directs strangers to join me and whoever else shows up, for a casual chat at the local coffee place at a specific time, with a few topics for conversation listed on the sign up front. If anyone has ideas for those topics, let me know, I'm likely to do it this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When NextDoor first came around, I recall walking down the street to help a lady move her couch down to the ground floor. She then gave me some cookies she'd baked. Fun! The notifications it sends me these days are less enjoyable so I send them to spam because unsubscribing doesn't seem to reliably work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Make a social network that is centered around people who live in a 1 kilometer radius…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't know if they still do, but Nextdoor required address verification via a postcard early on. I was pretty shocked at what some people in my area would post under their real names and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(And well outside the realm of political nonsense. Someone posted a pic of their toddler's first poop in the potty.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the power of shame has reduced significantly in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think shame is still powerful, but in the context of Nextdoor we just don't see our neighbors very often anymore. In many cases they might as well be random people on the other side of the country. I live in a small town and I'm quite friendly with my neighbors, but I still see and talk to them relatively rarely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you have a toddler it's very surprising what becomes normal. We're potty-training our son and I sometimes get texts from my spouse with a picture of a poop in a bad spot and then just the word "help."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I doubt it's the solution, but a silly program I want to build is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Give users a modern Tamagotchi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Give the digital pet a need to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Strap a basic LLM to it so users can talk to their pet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Have the pet imprint on its owner through repeated socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Owner goes to bed, pet still has social needs, goes out into the digital world to find other pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Pet talks to other pets while you're asleep, evaluates interactions, befriend those with good interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Owner wakes up the next morning, checks their pet, learns it befriended other pets based on shared interests, and is given an opportunity to connect with their pet's friends' owners. Ideally these connections have a better-than-random chance of succeeding since you're matched via shared interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure there's a ton of unsexy technical reasons this is hard to make work well in practice... but dang, I think it would be so cool if it worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realize this exacerbates the issue in some ways - promoting online-first interactions. But, I dunno. I'll take what I can get these days, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, it's more like meeting new acquaintances at the dog park. Dogs start playing with each other and getting along and you end up chatting with the other dog's owner while watching the dogs play together. Trying to recreate those vibes with digital pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMO the biggest barrier to entry to the hobby is the price, coupled with the existing communities being really old. I'm trying to get people to print their own cards for casual kitchen table play through https://cardstocktcg.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being happy with yourself and being OK that you're not advancing anymore (you're just happy and don't have anything to pursue), or raising a family. The only two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Who don't feel that they can join any local groups"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's your problem. Fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there aren't any local groups then help create one. If there are, go along, meet some people, see what works for you, join a different one if you didn't like the first one, keep going until you've found your people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you feel like you can't go to a group then create a support group for people who feel like they can't go to groups. Or go online and find the virtual space for people like you and then travel to see those people (or invite them to see you).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is no fix for you having to socialise if you're lonely. You're going to have to find a way in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who live in London, how did you find a solution for this? I am interested in hearing what you tried. I am in my very early 30s. Single male. I didn't feel up in UK. Moved here I my 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I normally don't contribute to HN comments these days (too much anger in the comments section) but I appreciate your post and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a tail-end boomer in the U.S. so my experiences were with a world where socializing was more functional: we shopped in public, played in public, read in public libraries, watched movies in public, rode transit together, etc. Being in public was a requirement, not a choice. While there are still remnants of this older culture still active in today's world in urban life, there are so many options for not being in public that it is simply easier to avoid it. We all want our space in one degree or another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the playground growing up, my world was filled with name-calling and backbiting. I was a heavier kid, so that was my burden. Other kids had bucked teeth, warts, limps, they were too short, or too tall, uncoordinated--whatever--nobody really escaped the wrath of the crowd. We were forced, by our parents, to just deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My parents like many others in their generation recognized this behavior for what it was--natural. Watch an episode of the Little Rascals--you will see what I am referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most if not all of those kids who were called names and isolated in some way found ways to break out of their pigeon hole: playing sports, playing music, making art, studying hard at school, boxing, singing, dancing, cracking jokes, whatever. Then they were heroes, and the crowd could celebrate them--and they thrived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know this sounds overly idealistic, but it is true. I experienced this first hand in a neighborhood of several hundred kids from broken homes, poor homes, ethnic homes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voiceless people must find their voice. The responsibility is their's. The crowd will not come to the rescue of the person who won't stand up for themselves and make their way in life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness is very, very sad. The cure to loneliness is in the powerful hands of the lonely person. Do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to work on those things that hold the lonely person back from achieving something--anything--for themselves and then engage with the crowd with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate what you are doing by helping others--that is one of your superpowers. Live a good, strong life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your first paragraph is what I've always thought: "back in the day" most people simply didn't have the option to be a hermit. In modern life, your bills, grocery shopping, car registration, hobbies, etc. can all be handled online / in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it takes a lot of time and energy to avoid loneliness in the modern era. So, advice about "just get yourself out there" is technically accurate, but it misses the mark since previous generations didn't need to put much thought, if any, into socializing. Perhaps not everyone is wired to focus so much energy into that aspect of their life and we're seeing that play out with modern amenities?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We (reading this) can't do anything. An enlightened government might set policy in such ways as to fix this over the course of decades, but I don't even seen that being acknowledged as possible or desirable in those same decades. The problem will continue to deteriorate until it becomes catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I visit whatever sport activity I can find. Like Go Karting, gymnastics, bouldering, etc and always start asking pro guys: “yo, how come you visit this so often? How do you get fun from it?”. And people lovely tell their story. Later they teach me how to do things. It works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dont know the solution but few things that are root cause:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Internet and Social Media&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Neighborhoods no longer are walkable especially suburbs at least in America. Kids are not encouraged to go bike to their friends place anymore because of traffic risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- High Trust societies have degraded into "lets keep ot myself, I can't trust anyone these days". Decades ago, you could just walk into a neighbor's home and say hello. Now, you need an appointment just to talk to a neighbor or are too worried what they will think of you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No real friendships after school/colleges. This is a huge deal once you are out on your own in the real world. Work relationships are meh at best and with remote work nowadays, it has become even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Even if you join a club or activity, they are too "planned" and "robotic". For example, my kids take a dance class and they said they don't like it. I realized why. There is no break. They don't even get to spend like 30 mins with other kids socializing etc. There is a fixed schedule. You go, you dance, you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is the world today. So I don't know how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe our built environment shouldn't consist solely of isolated houses in isolated gated communities where we drive our kids and sit in isolated cars in the school dropoff/pickup lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may just be me, but I hold the opposite view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I lived in a rural area with a few acres of property, I was much more social and engaged with my community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I live at the edge of the city in a medium-high density townhouse area with no private outdoor space. Since I can never really get away from people and be alone, I also have no desire to go out and do things and engage with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the variability is nice. If I can get home, relax, not have people around, have some private outdoor space, then I can recharge and have the energy to engage more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In person RPGs, tabletop wargames and boardgames are amazing for geek culture. Thanks to local Discord groups, I have an active nerd community that I play games with at least once a week. This has revolutionized by social life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a introvert crafty side of painting and 3D printing miniatures; that works great for me too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These games all work as essentially offline alternatives to videogames and are way more fun!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, my local game store serves beer; so its essentially a nerd bar even though most people don't drink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;go volunteer. they're needed everywhere. problem solved. most able-bodied lonely people are that way because they can't be arsed to get off the damn couch. they would just rather discuss loneliness on social media. I can't be arsed either, but I don't feel lonely when I'm alone, which is the majority of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the big solution consists of many small solutions. One problem I identified is that social media platforms (1) decimated local live music events coverage in mid-sized cities and (2) placed live music events into the same "filter bubble" algorithm as everything else, making it difficult for people to discover what is going on nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started https://musiclocal.org, a 501(c)(3), as a curated live music events platform for my local area (and hopefully others). We list all the live music events in the area, and we optimize the software for usability, performance, SEO, etc. The goal is to make discovering local live music events as easy as doom-scrolling. We have had an outstanding reception in the area we serve. We are not self-sustaining yet, but I am optimistic about our chances. As a non-profit, we do not do any of the dark-pattern garbage that has become omnipresent in social media and other consumer software. We just do the right thing as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some more background (from our "Issues" page):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At MusicLocal, we focus on the root challenges facing local music communities to address endemic issues of negative social media practices, isolation and community polarization, and economic concentration and monopolization. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• We believe convenient, comprehensive live music event listings are critical to reversing the decline in local music journalism. • We believe ethically designed, steward-curated live music event listings provide a vital alternative to addictive social media platforms. • We believe that making live music more visible and accessible encourages in-person interaction, strengthening communities and alleviating loneliness and social isolation. • We believe that local live music listings are a critical component of strong local economies, helping to lessen the negative economic consequences of big tech and music industry monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The older people get the more disposable they are viewed as by society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you are younger, you belong in school. When you get older, you belong at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you fall out of any of these social structures its extremely difficult to find your way back in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was already pretty disconnected from society and people in general when my divorce hit and now I am completely untethered from any kind of community. Living is miserable I hate my life and I do not want to exist like this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the solutions people provide are easy or functional. "Go meet people" is the most vague, unhelpful bullshit ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the reality is some people, no matter how intelligent, caring or otherwise full of empathy they may be are just "too far gone" for anyone to have the initiative or concern to care about us. The world is so corroded and socially poisoned that any kind of meaningful effort in this kind of thing is pointless. Anybody with time or money is busy making money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't solve the epidemic because it is a byproduct of multiple irreparably broken systems. People will continue to fall through the cracks and it will get worse. I don't know what happens after that but we'll probably all be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would suggest for the crowd here: tech meetups, even online ones and communities will connect you to people with your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing that you'll likely find in your area is a chess club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you won't love the chess itself, but it's an excuse to hang out with people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another one is volunteering work. Elderly, dogs, etc, many communities need help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my village I have started a "clean up" program where average citizens take few bags a picker and we clean areas of our village.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of people are "this is the job of the garbage collectors, the mayor should do it", so what? It also costs money, and nobody will do as carefully as the people living there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if 95% of my village won't care few will and we make an impact and socialize, etc and more start taking part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have 2 answers to this, depending on how you define "loneliness epidemic"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genuine loneliness, like what you described, can only really be solved by touching grass. Figure out your hobbies, or find one if you don't have any.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My answer to what a lot of people call "the male loneliness epidemic" as a woman is to say it doesn't exist, you need to figure out how to be attractive. We aren't throwing ourselves on shitty men, and most of the men that complain are complaining because they feel entitled to us and thus put no effort into being attractive. The quickest way to be attractive is have empathy and not be a douche. Listen to peoples needs, and don't feel entitled to our attention&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The quickest way to be attractive is have empathy and not be a douche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would suggest most people are attractive. Is an empathic non-asshole really attractive, even without other things that make him interesting (e.g. travel experiences or interesting takes on things)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, let's start by confronting and acknowledging the very strong case that we -- "we" here being the tech world in general, and the audience of this site -- bear a heavy burden of responsibility for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could be argued that it was all inevitable given the development of the Internet: development of social media, the movement online of commerce and other activities that used to heavily involve "incidental" socialization, etc. And maybe it was. But "we" are still the ones who built it. So are "we" really the right ones to solve it, through the same old silicon valley playbook?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual thought process of trying to push local "community groups," hobby-based organizations etc is not bad, but I think it misses an important piece of the puzzle, which is that we've started a kind of death spiral, a positive feedback loop suppressing IRL interaction. People started to move online because it was easier, and more immediate than "IRL." But as more people, and a greater fraction of our social interaction moves online, "IRL" in turn becomes even more featureless. There are fewer community groups, fewer friends at the bar or the movies, fewer people open to spontaneous interaction. This, then, drives even more of culture online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What use is trying to get "back out into the real world," when everyone else has left it too, while you were gone?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone has left the real world, only the people who got really sucked into the online/social media world. This can maybe seem like the whole world though, if you're in that bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bars are still packed on the weekends, people still gather at churches, or gyms, or bowling leagues, or book clubs, or any number of other "IRL" activities of all kinds that are going on. You do have to make the effort to go out and get involved though, nobody is going to come and rescue you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affordable third places[0] where people can impromptu join and serendipitously meet friendly faces repeatedly. All of my strong friendships were from exactly this at either skateparks, college dorm common area, or run clubs. Churches had this figured out for millenia&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone suffering in the loneliness epidemic should have a copy of The Great Good Place, by Ray Oldenburg. The entire point is that you should be putting yourself into socially active areas in your community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This includes: a church, a local pub or coffee shop with regulars (ideally walking distance from where you live), a rec sports/game league or club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing this, I've perused it in my life and it seems very effective. I'm a regular at a Trivia Night one night per week (I don't go every week, but enough to know both the bartender and host by name). I'm a regular at a bar three blocks away from where I live, even if I consume only one non-alcoholic beverage and one alcoholic beverage per visit (a couple night a week), that leaves me plenty of time to chat with my neighbors. I'm a member of a local golf club (a very cheap municipal course), and play there every other week, and after a couple years have very good relationships with many of the other members even if we don't interact much outside of the club. At my last apartment, I was a regular at the coffee shop enough to know multiple baristas by name, it wasn't exactly a third place situation, but it was getting close before I moved. I'm not religious, but I'm very familiar with academic institutions and open lecture series that I used tot attend in grad school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do this intentionally. My partner had never been a regular at a bar before, and she really, really enjoys it now even though she doesn't really drink. When she joins me, she will maybe consume one-half of a light beer. You don't have to be an alcoholic to be a regular, this is a major point that Oldenburg discusses when he contrasts German-style drinking culture with English-style drinking culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it seems like a lot of locales that would have been third places in the past have been neutered because the people go there and then immediately put up walls. coffeeshops have become ad-hoc offices where people will sit there with a laptop and give off "leave me alone, i'm working".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;people need to find a way to sit in a third space without pulling up a screen or a book that immediately re-isolates you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;also: don't underestimate the subtle effect of architecture and seating arrangements here. a coffee shop is filled with lots of little two-seat tables that intentionally isolate. for contrast, think about local pubs/bars -- there's one big central seating arrangement where evertybody is facing the bartender. the bartender is naturally placed in a position that makes them serve as a conversational mediator that can facilitate connections between then people hanging out on the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared stressors are what bring people together. Communities form when a group of people all have the same problem. Go around egging peoples homes in your neighbourhood, and keep doing it. By the time your neighbours finally catch you they will all have gotten to know and appreciate one another better. They will have formed a communtiy identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm feeling lonely, I stop feeling lonely and feel awesome instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of good suggestions in here. People just need to go do them. And if there are structural impediments to doing them, then eliminate those impediments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wasn't getting out enough during the day because I share the car with my wife. So I bought an EBike and now I go out all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose to live in a place with things near by that I can go to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I'm thinking, I'd like to go do an activity, but I need something else first, it's usually not true, or the other thing I need is easy to get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People just need to decide to stop doing things that make them unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy, same as obesity and environmental problems: fix the built environment by building places for humans, not cars. It all stems from that in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that can happen even when you are among 1000s of people, not just alone , if you are among people thinking of something else, staring into the void or that you can't connect etc. you are a deep person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep person + deep thinker is the worse. Also people aren't doing them any favor by singing the praise of being a deep person and a deep thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also has to do with abundance of everything and being not in need of cooperating 24/7/365 to avoid starving ....some people slip into deep thinking and deep emotional introspection...yeah fuck that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know homeless people and rich people, equally lonely and unfulfilled and unhappy. I don't know what the solution is. I'm trying to figure it out. But I know that throwing money at this problem does little to solve it. I know from experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's so interesting to see the tech community all angsty about the loneliness epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20 years ago, the Pope warned of the coming "epidemic of loneliness" that the tech industry would bring us, and the tech industry laughed at him. They said he was just an old man who didn't understand and that technology would bring us together in unity and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, here we are 20 years later, and hardly a day goes by that someone doesn't submit an article to HN about loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness epidemic started 30+ years ago. There were books written in the 90s about it(bowling alone). Nothing modern can be blamed on it. If anything, social media is helping the crisis; not causing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 'fixes' has been established for just as long. My nearby 'community centre' was built in 1987. Has this been successful at all? Not in the least bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality of what is causing this hasnt changed. Without fixing this key problem, the crisis obviously has continued for 30+ years. I'm not nostradamus here. However, from many previous conversations it's crazy how absolutely nobody is ready to talk about the cause. They'd rather just call it a paradox or feign ignorance for why this is happening. Honestly it's rather conspiratorial creating when you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of curiousity I asked what gemini 3 pro thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Revival of third places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As if that hasnt been tried for 30+ years... fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. replacing 'socializing' with "service"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that cleaning a park will somehow make you less lonely is laughable at best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Bridging the generational gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elderly teach the young skills? while youth teach digital literacy. My community centre literally has this. F mark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Urban design and walkability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to spend trillions of dollars to completely redesign and rebuild cities? lol what.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. digital hygiene&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;social media is a sedative? crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love gemini, but man they are getting it so wrong. All of this will likely just caused the crisis to be worse in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, has this been done unintentionally through the typical 'road to hell is paved with good intentions' or has this been intentionally done and maintained? The refusal to acknowledge the cause seems to push toward intentional. Guess we just live with the loneliness epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that social media is normalized and it is easy. It is way easier to engage socially (or at least you feel like you're engaging socially) with likes and lurking and stuff. It is way harder to put on pants and go out and it is normalized to do so (phrasing like bedrotting is super casual, whereas it is actually really hard to maintain an eating disorder because you have to be constantly hiding it from people).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also I think there's more groups whose social norms online teach you to be repulsive offline and again there's not enough social pushback against it. We do need to be harder on casual edginess online because it is teaching habitual behaviors that make it hard to engage socially. Your 50 year old hiking buddy is not going to understand your soycuck joke you are trying to show him on your phone. Your average wine mom at women-only book club is not going to love if you insist on talking about banning trans people from the club because they're "men invading the women's spaces" especially when there's very likely 0 trans people to exclude in the first place on account of trans people being rare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly there is usually a ton of stuff happening but the instructions on how to engage with it is nebulous. People who know the algorithm find it easy, the people who don't know the algorithm find it super hard. And IDK how to solve that because there's so much going on in people's heads that they don't realize the people around them seriously aren't scrutinizing them that much. There's like a socialization death spiral where every small awkward interaction hurts way more when you don't have enough experience to know that the small awkward interactions are normal. So you can't tell someone "just go to book club" because they'll go, have 1 normal situation like mishearing someone and then decide they are so embarrassed they can never go to book club again-- but since it is so normal it happens at every social event and they end up lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You actually bring up the biggest obstacle to my tentative idea for this Sunday, of holding up a sign that points to a time/place for a casual conversation with strangers. I thought this would be a good way to get very lonely passers-by out of their comfort zone and into a situation where they have a chance to make friends and bond, but the absolute diversity of interests is the main show stopper. My first thought was to essentially avoid sensitive topics on the poster, such as religion and politics, but it still leaves the huge diversity of potential common interests open. So I started doing some research on the most common hobbies that people have in cities and that can be talked about casually, in hopes of finding like 5 ot 6 to write on the sign to get people into the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i wonder if a resurgence in social clubs like the Elks club/Moose lodge would ever catch on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i don't know how big they ever were in the past, but it seemed like it was commonly represented in media in the 50s/60s (e.g., the flintstones had a parody of the lodge which would suggest that they were common enough that people were familiar)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, first, props to you because you're actually doing something to initiate contact. That's a really big deal; more people need to do that. (Maybe even some that don't wrestle with loneliness.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what's you're next step? Someone comes up and marks that they feel really lonely. Do you get contact information? Invite them to something? (Invite them to what? You may have to create something - a board game night at your house, or a "lonely people shopping together" time at a grocery store, or something. You probably have to create that "something", because you're the one who's able to at least reach out, and the ones who are responding probably aren't there yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're finding people that need something. The next step is to find a way to connect them - with you, or with each other, or with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For any activity you come up with, some people won't be able to, due to time or temperament or personality or something. So maybe what you need is more than one. (Eventually. Look, don't get overwhelmed by that. Just one is the next step, in my view. And maybe some helpers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So your proposal is to start an ad hoc friend group with people who come up to me, and try to become friends with them personally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I'm the right person for that. I live in a suburb, not the city that I do the surveys in. And I'm extraordinarily boring, and too old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that I should try to think bigger. Try to find a way to help these people connect with each other. Something in person, not an app like Hinge. Maybe, hold a sign that says ad hoc meet and greet at such and such time and place, after collecting a list of common interests and putting those interests on the same sign that says the time and date. That could work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my city, an older guy organized an “urban hiking group” where he would plan walking routes through the city, usually stopping at a restaurant for brunch. It was very popular, but probably a lot of work. He was semi-retired, so he had the time to do it. He did research to have talking points on the history of some spots we passed, like a tour guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a great low key meet up. You didn’t have to make friends with the organizer. If you were walking with someone you didn’t really like in the group, it was easy to drift to talk to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is up to them to change. They won't change, and this "loneliness epidemic" is starting to become really fucking annoying. It is almost a grift now to shit on tech by mids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people don't want to go outside or engage with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is like people who are drug/alcohol/tobacco/gambling/sex/etc addicts. It is up to the individual to change. How is it anyone else's responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I surveyed a bunch of people on reddit, discords, etc. a couple years ago to figure out why people are lonely, back when this whole "loneliness" movement was starting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of these people say they have "trauma" or some other mental block as a primary reason why they're lonely (btw they're in discords with thousands of people, and playing online games with OTHER PEOPLE). I'm sorry but everyone has shit going on in their lives. You aren't really that special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe 1-5% of people have dealt with actual, really horrific trauma, and even they have managed to go on to have fulfilling lives. They chose to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an asshole, no doubt, and I've dealt with my own traumas in the past that were honestly way more fucking horrible than "I'm shy" or "nobody likes [insert some esoteric niche]" and guess what? Who cares? Go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no helping these people, or anyone to be honest, unless they really want to make a change. These aren't starving Sudanese or people who live in India or something where you can't just "go outside". Mfs be in CALIFORNIA and crying. I'd understand if they were lonely because they were living in Iraq or Venezuela or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only solution is we build a Matrix, and put all these people into it. I will bet 100% of my net worth and any earnings from my entire lineage for perpetuity that they will still fucking complain and be lonely. I was really hopeful for metaverse, too bad but maybe there's still a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never want to hear about "loneliness epidemic" again, to me it just sounds like DEI/ESG/Eacc and other bs grifting now to hate on tech. Everything is a choice. You press A in a video game even though you're lonely, why not press A to go outside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people aren't lonely, they exist in massive online echo chambers with other people. And honestly? I think they like it. Most drug addicts loved being on drugs even though it was a horrific existence. They don't like it when they're narcan'd during OD. But when they decide to get clean, I am proud that they actually did it how amazing is that? SO these lonely people have to stop crying and step outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;from what I've looked into, on an individual level, the main thing I need to do is learn how to be a good company for others. Be for other strangers what I would want them to be for me. But it's easier said then done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a practical perspective, there is the whole "3rd place" issue. How can I open a business that caters to the public, who will just sit there and loiter on their phones and laptops all day and be profitable. Starbucks sort of did it in the 90s, but they're not tolerating that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forget businesses, can you walk to a park, a beach, a hiking trail on a whim and run into people? Can you hold events, watch parties,etc.. on public places easily like that? It's not easy at all these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I blame cars. I despise the idea that electric cars are the replacement to cars, without considering changing transportation so that it is more efficient with trams, trains,etc... The side-effect of that is you run into strangers on public transport. This doesn't just affect the loneliness epidemic, it is in my opinion a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and of course obesity. You can't even be homeless and sleep on the streets these days. Even the park benches are built to be hostile to anyone that wants to chill there for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society was restructured between 1950s-1980s so that it is suburbanized. It's all about the family unit, single family homes, freeways and roads built to facilitate single family homes (after WW2, starting families was all the rage, plus white-flight didn't help). Shopping centers built to cater to consumers driving from their suburban homes. Malls you can walk in, after you drove some time to park there. Even when you buy food items at grocery stores, pay attention to serving sizes, it is improving a little, but you'll see at minimum a serving size of two typically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society was deliberately engineered so that you have more reasons to spend more as a consumer. Families spend more per-capita. suburbs mean more houses purchased, entire generations renting with their bank as a landlord via mortgages, home repair, home insurance, car insurance, car repairs, gas stations for cars where you can get the most unhealthy things out there in the most frequented and convenient places. Make kids, make wives, make ex-wives, get sick the whole lot of you for hospitals, health insurances,etc..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't planned by some central committees or secret cabal, but it was planned nonetheless by economists and policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If everyone just got married and had kids, they won't be lonely would they? you don't need to hang out at park with strangers, you'll feel less of a member of your local neighborhood who look and think like you, and start thinking more as one people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the interpersonal interactions and opportunities to build relationships with people are commercialized and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one reason or another, people are just not getting married in their early 20's anymore, or having that many kids later on like before. Even when you get married, your interaction is by design with other married people, who are busy commuting in their cars to and fro work, kids school,kids sports, plays,etc... imagine taking your kids on busses and trains every day to these places which are fairly near-by, by necessity. you'll be spending time with them instead of operating machinery. They'll be meeting stranger kids from other schools, seeing random strangers all the time, you'll be talking to randos as you walk to the train, wait on the bus,etc.. but this can't be monetized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blame the economists and policy makers if you want to blame someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want solutions, let's talk explicitly about the policy changes that need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too much traffic? tear down the freeways instead of building more lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It costs $10B to build a simple metro line? pass better laws to regulate bidding and costs, investigate fraud and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to dig even deeper into the root of the matter, look at what is celebrated and prized in society. Most of its ills come from there. For most Americans, it is inconceivable to be able to just go out of your house without any plans or destination in mind and just start walking and see where you end up, and who you run into. That's a crucial and tragic ability that's been lost. We really have more urgent things to address to be fair, but ultimately, this can only be solved one small step at a time, but also big sweeping changes are needed. The first step is to define and accept what the problem is, and where the blame and cause lie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HN has some odd people that don't jump to tech solutions for everything. Plus I'm banned from reddit for 3 days for making a dark joke, and besides, my reddit post asking the same thing went nowhere. At least people here engage in good faith and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually wanted to suggest government funded online dating, so we aren't beholden to godawful Tinder and its clones (OkCupid was great for me until it got bought out and turned into Tinder).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a slightly different angle on that - Government mandated open algorithms, exposure of sort factors (are you in the back of the line in the swipe queue), and monthly disclosure of male/female ratios. Yeah, it'll effectively crush their business models and then they actually need to start solving the problems they've created (extreme superficiality, not background checking users, not addressing bots, not acknowledging that US has an implicit class system)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out if I have enough energy to try to pitch this to my representatives office, but I don't know if 30-40% adults never marrying or falling birth rates would be arguments that democratic politician would care to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am somewhat suspicious of this loneliness epidemic. 81% of Americans are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied with their personal life[0]. And my personal experience is that both close friends and general civil community is easy to find[1]. I wasn't trying at all so it can't be that there are any real constraints here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think [0] is showing what you think it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; % Very satisfied with the way things are going in personal life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Dropped from 65% in 2020 to 44% in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Record-Low 44% of Americans Are 'Very Satisfied' With Their Personal Life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also focusing on the raw percentages of these style reports is challenging, due to socially desirable response bias [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact it is dropping is the important part, it is a relative measure, not a absolute one, and I am sure Gallop would change there questions/responses in a modern survey that didn't need to maintain compatibility with historical data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Gallup (not Gallop) has the English questions and responses in the PDF at the bottom of the page. They will also respond if you email them so you can check if wording changed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Yes, I am pretty sure the Gallup thing is showing exactly what I think it does considering I said "81% are [somewhat] satisfied or very satisfied" and the Gallup survey shows that 81% are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* The fact that the Hacker News community was enthusiastic about the thesis of a loneliness epidemic during a period when satisfaction was rising casts aspersions on "the fact that it is dropping is the important part". When satisfaction was rising, there were still posts on that where everyone was agreeing about how bad it was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was looking at the PDF [0] and [1] and [0] calls out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;``QN5:Personal Satisfaction is a binary question``, with a category for refused/didn't know that WAS NOT OFFERED IN THE QUESTION, with an additional question asking about very, sort of etc... They call out `QN5QN6COMBO: Personal Life Satisfaction`&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't answer the HN sentiment straw man, the DELTA from previous results is what is important. Using it as an absolute scale would almost certainly be discouraged if you asked them via the email address in the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic statistics realities here, and Gallup knows the limits far better than the comment section here. And they understand that "81% are [somewhat] satisfied or very satisfied" especially when presented as two trivial properties, has limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again they asked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your personal life at this time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then followed up with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are you very [satisfied/dissatisfied], or just somewhat [satisfied/dissatisfied]?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how both of those are binary, with a NULL being an option to mark down as an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's a straw man. If it is true that the delta matters and it is also true that at the time when this metric was showing the most positive results and trending upwards, online communities such as this talk about the existence of the loneliness epidemic https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20468767 then one must ask oneself whether this is a property of the online communities in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time when the gallup poll showed an upward trend towards its peak this community was talking about the loneliness epidemic. When the gallup poll shows a downward trend toward its lowest, this community is talking about the loneliness epidemic. And it's the change in satisfaction that is the most significant. So there are two changes in opposite directions causing the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this were happening to me, I would ask myself "Am I sure this is a general property and not just a property of me?". Do you find this not convincing to move your estimate of the likelihood of the loneliness epidemic actually existing? If you don't, it's all right. We can leave it here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 81% of Americans are satisfied or very satisfied with their personal life[0].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, 81% are "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied". I don't think "satisfied" is synonymous with "somewhat satisfied".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth noting, as the article states, that this is the lowest value in the history of the poll, going back to 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It shouldn't be too surprising that the overall value is high and stable over time. Hedonic adaptation[1] is a core property of our emotional wiring. The fact that the value is the lowest it's been in a quarter century should still be ringing alarm bells. We are not OK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a 5 point scale, so landing a 4 or 5 on satisfaction on a 5 point scale seems significant. Also, when the value was at its highest in that time series, Hacker News had articles like this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20468767&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments there are full of people describing this loneliness epidemic when 65% of people were very satisfied and 90% of people were "somewhat satisfied or very satisfied". No matter what surveys of people's satisfaction with their personal lives show, there appears to be an enthusiasm for this subject of the loneliness epidemic. This makes me suspect that this is less an epidemic than an 'endemic' (if you'll forgive the word).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, I didn't intend to mislead so I'll edit it to say "somewhat satisfied or very satisfied (4 or 5 on a 5 point scale).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It's a 5 point scale, so landing a 4 or 5 on satisfaction on a 5 point scale seems significant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it is absolutely not. Gallup is not asking "on a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your satisfaction?" They are asking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your personal life at this time? Are you very [satisfied/dissatisfied], or just somewhat [satisfied/dissatisfied]?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to surveys and social science the specific wording of questions has a huge impact on the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, and 81% of people are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied. And the loneliness epidemic thesis was popular around the time that very satisfied was at its peak of 65% (when somewhat or very satisfied summed up to 90%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you read the article you cited or are you just evaluating the snapshot of numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Forty-four percent of Americans say they are “very satisfied” with the way things are going in their personal life, the lowest by two percentage points in Gallup’s trend dating back to 2001. This also marks the continuation of a decline in personal satisfaction since January 2020, when the measure peaked at 65%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Record-Low 44% of Americans Are 'Very Satisfied' With Their Personal Life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then to link to your own blog post as though that were a supporting citation is strange to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My blog post is a more detailed expression of a sentence that starts with "my personal experience". I think that's fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course I read the article. That's why my sentence explicitly says "satisfied or very satisfied" whereas the text you quote only selects the "very satisfied". One can imagine that if I had only linked without reading I could not possibly have guessed 81% correctly either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying "just stop being depressed". I'm questioning that any significant portion of the population is depressed. I think that's valid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CodeBreach: Infiltrating the AWS Console Supply Chain and Hijacking AWS GitHub Repositories via CodeBuild&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz Research discovered a critical supply chain vulnerability that abused a CodeBuild misconfiguration to take over key AWS GitHub repositories - including the JavaScript SDK powering the AWS Console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz Research uncovered CodeBreach, a critical vulnerability that placed the AWS Console supply chain at risk. The issue allowed a complete takeover of key AWS GitHub repositories - most notably the AWS JavaScript SDK, a core library that powers the AWS Console. By exploiting CodeBreach, attackers could have injected malicious code to launch a platform-wide compromise, potentiallyaffecting not just the countless applications depending on the SDK, but the Console itself, threatening every AWS account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability stemmed from a subtle flaw in how the repositories’ AWS CodeBuild CI pipelines handled build triggers. Just two missing characters in a Regex filter allowed unauthenticated attackers to infiltrate the build environment and leak privileged credentials. This post breaks down how we leveraged this subtle misconfiguration to achieve a full repository takeover, and provides keyrecommendations for CodeBuild users to harden their own projects against similar attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz responsibly disclosed all findings to AWS, who promptly remediated the issue. AWS also implemented global hardening measures within the CodeBuild service to prevent similar attacks. Most notably, the new Pull Request Comment Approval build gate offers organizations a simple and secure path to prevent untrusted builds. Read the AWS Advisory here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue follows a familiar pattern seen in recent supply-chain attacks like the Nx S1ngularity incident, where subtle CI/CD misconfigurations lead to disproportionately impactful attacks. Just last July, a threat actor abused a similar CodeBuild issue to launch a supply chain attack against users of the Amazon Q VS Code extension. This growing trend underscores the urgent need for organizations to harden their CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Required Actions and Mitigations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While no immediate action is required by downstream consumers of the affected AWS GitHub repositories, we strongly recommend all AWS CodeBuild users implement the following safeguards to protect their own projects against similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent Untrusted Pull Requests from Triggering Privileged Builds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you must rely on webhook filters, ensure their regex patterns are anchored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure the CodeBuild-GitHub Connection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate a unique, fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) for each CodeBuild project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strictly limit the PAT's permissions to the minimum required, as listed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider using a dedicated unprivileged GitHub account for the CodeBuild integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find Vulnerable CodeBuild Projects with Wiz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiz customers can find CodeBuild projects that trigger builds based on untrusted pull requests using this pre-built query in the Wiz Threat Intel Center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why We Audited CodeBuild&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our investigation into AWS CodeBuild was sparked by the attempted supply-chain attack on the Amazon Q VS Code extension. In that incident, an attacker exploited a misconfigured CodeBuild project to compromise the extension’s GitHub repository and inject malicious code into the main branch. This code was then included in a release which users downloaded. Although the attacker’s payload ultimately failed due to a typo, it did execute on end users’ machines - clearly demonstrating the risk of misconfigured CodeBuild pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CodeBuild is a managed CI service that’s commonly connected to GitHub repositories, triggering builds on events like new pull requests. To interact with GitHub, CodeBuild requires GitHub credentials, which are, by default, present in the memory of the build environment. This creates a critical risk: if an attacker can compromise a single build, they are just a memory dump away from stealing credentials that often possess powerful permissions over the source repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Build or Not To Build: The Pull Request Problem&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common way to compromise a CI build is through a pull request. An attacker forks the target repository, adds malicious code, and then opens a PR against the original project. If CodeBuild is configured to spawn builds on PR events, it will trigger a build based on the attacker's branch. In the vast majority of build systems like make or yarn, controlling the source code of a build process is enough to run arbitrary code. This is the exact mechanism the attacker exploited to compromise the Amazon Q extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent this attack scenario, CodeBuild offers webhook filters - a set of rules that an event must meet to trigger a build. Back in August, these filters were the primary defense against untrusted pull requests. Among the available options, the go-to solution was the ACTOR_ID filter: an allow-list of approved GitHub user IDs that ensures only trusted users can trigger a build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seemed like a robust defense, but maintaining a list of user IDs can be cumbersome. We wondered: were organizations actually using this filter correctly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find out, we decided to search for GitHub repositories connected to Public CodeBuild projects. When set to public, CodeBuild projects expose their settings via a publicly accessible dashboard and automatically link to it in the status of any commit that triggers a build. From the dashboard, anyone can view the project's build logs and configurations - including the exact webhook filters being used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Apparent Dead End&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial scan was promising. We quickly found seven AWS-owned repositories with public CodeBuild pages. Of those, four were active and configured to run builds on pull requests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Registry of Open Data on AWS (awslabs/open-data-registry)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first glance, everything seemed secure. All four projects implemented an ACTOR_ID filter, locking down builds to a list of approved maintainers. It appeared to be a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the filter's syntax, shown above, was unusual for a typical ID list. The user IDs weren’t separated by commas or spaces, but by a pipe | character. That small detail was the key: in regular expressions, the | character means "OR". Reviewing the documentation confirmed it: the filter wasn't a simple list, it was a regex pattern. And it had a fatal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unanchored: How a Subtle Flaw Led to CI Compromise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue was simple but critical: the regex patterns weren’t anchored. Without the start ^ and end $ anchors to require an exact match, a regex engine doesn't look for a string that perfectly matches the pattern, but one that merely contains it. This meant that any GitHub user ID that is a superstring of an approved ID could bypass the filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a powerful primitive in theory, but its success depended on a practical question: is it possible to register a brand-new GitHub user ID that contained the ID of an existing user?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When IDs Align&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is yes, and it hinges on how GitHub assigns IDs. Every user is given a unique and sequential numeric ID. Early accounts from 2008 have 5-digit IDs, while accounts from recent years ballooned to 9-digit IDs. As this sequence of numbers grows, it's inevitable that shorter, older IDs appear as substrings within longer, newer ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our tests, GitHub creates roughly 200,000 new IDs each day. At that rate, for any given 6-digit maintainer ID, a new, longer ID containing it would become available for registration approximately every five days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We dubbed this recurring window of opportunity an "eclipse" -- the moment a new, longer ID perfectly "shadowed" a trusted maintainer's ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All four AWS repositories had short maintainer IDs only 6 or 7 digits long, resulting in frequent eclipses that made them all valid targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catching an Eclipse: Winning the Race for a Target ID&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having confirmed that a new GitHub ID could contain a maintainer's ID, the challenge became operational: how could we claim a specific ID the instant it became available? This was practically a race condition against the entire world, with roughly two new GitHub users created every second. We needed a way to create a lot of GitHub users at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard user sign-up flow is protected by reCAPTCHA, making automated account creation impossible. We needed a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attempt #1: Organizations for ID Sampling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first thought was to use the GitHub Enterprise API to create organizations, which share the same ID pool as users. While this could allow us to claim the target ID, GH organization accounts can't open pull requests, making them useless for the final exploit. It wasn't a total dead end though. We repurposed this API into an ID sampling tool: we could create an organization, check its ID to see how close we were to the target ID, and then immediately delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough: The GitHub App Manifest Flow&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real breakthrough came from GitHub Apps. Creating an app generates a corresponding bot user (e.g. app-name[bot]) that can interact with pull requests. It’s also possible to automate app creation via the manifest flow. While it’s composed of a few steps, it can be made atomic: the app and its bot are only created when a final confirmation URL is visited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allowed us to prepare hundreds of app creation requests in advance and then, at the precise moment, visit all their confirmation URLs simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our strategy in place, it was time to execute. We routinely used the organization-creation API to sample the current GitHub ID, allowing us to accurately predict the moment of the eclipse. We also initiated the manifest flow for 200 new GitHub Apps, collecting their unique confirmation URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We waited until the live ID count was just ~100 IDs away from the target ID, and then visited all 200 URLs at once, triggering a flood of new bot user registrations. The target ID was 226755743, which contained a trusted maintainer ID for the aws/aws-sdk-js-v3 repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the registrations completed, a quick check confirmed our success:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d captured a user ID that could bypass the ACTOR_ID filter, and the method was reliable enough to be successfully repeated for each of the four target repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Bypass to Admin: Executing the Takeover&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our bot user able to bypass the ACTOR_ID filter, we were ready to execute the proof-of-concept. We chose to target the aws/aws-sdk-js-v3 repository, preparing a pull request that fixes a legitimate issue. Buried within the PR was the real payload: a new NPM package dependency designed to execute in the build environment and extract the GitHub credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We submitted the PR, and soon after received a notification: a build had been triggered. Moments later, we had successfully obtained the GitHub credentials of the aws-sdk-js-v3 CodeBuild project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you're up for a challenge, try to find the commit in the PR that triggered the build.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our payload retrieved the GH token by dumping the memory of a process within the build environment. A previous memory dump mitigation in CodeBuild, which AWS implemented in response to the Amazon Q incident, overlooked this particular process. Following our disclosure, CodeBuild now protects this process as well. While this is a welcomed improvement, it isn’t bulletproof. GitHub credentials still reside in the build’s memory, and attackers with Linux privilege escalation exploits can circumvent memory protections. That’s why the most robust mitigation is using build gates to prevent untrusted builds from running in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Blast Radius&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The credentials we obtained were a GitHub Classic Personal Access Token (PAT) belonging to the aws-sdk-js-automation user. For an attacker, this was the perfect user to compromise, as it regularly interacts with the repository and releases new versions to GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We quickly confirmed that the aws-sdk-js-automation user had full admin privileges over the repository. Initially though, our access was scoped by the token's permissions: repo and admin:repo_hook. To escalate privileges, we abused the token’s repo scope, which can manage repository collaborators, and invited our own GitHub user to be a repository administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As administrators, we could now push code directly to the main branch, approve any pull request, and exfiltrate repository secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This level of control provided a clear path for supply chain attacks. The JavaScript SDK is released on a weekly basis to GitHub and then to NPM. Abusing this frequent release schedule, attackers could have injected malicious payloads right before a release was published, compromising it. Just a month prior, a threat actor using this exact method successfully infected downstream users of the Amazon Q VS Code extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Amazon Q incident was serious, the potential impact here was exponentially greater. Based on our analysis, a staggering 66% of cloud environments include the JavaScript SDK - meaning two out of every three environments host an instance with the SDK installed.It’s an exceptionally prominent software library, and among its users is perhaps the cloud’s most critical application: The AWS Console itself. Moreover, the Console bundles recent SDK versions; the image below shows a request from the console which includes user credentials and uses an SDK version released just 18 days prior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the aws-sdk-js-v3 repository, the token we obtained had full admin privileges over several other repositories related to the JavaScript SDK. Among them were three private repositories, including what appeared to be AWS’s private mirrors of the JavaScript SDK. At this point though, given the demonstrated takeover and its potential impact, we halted further research and immediately reported the issues to AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, this vulnerability extended beyond the SDK.While we only performed the CI takeover on the aws-sdk-js-v3 repository, the same ACTOR_ID filter bypass was present in at least three other AWS GitHub repositories. Threat actors could have exploited these to compromise the GH credentials for three additional GH accounts. Two were automation accounts like aws-sdk-js-automation, but one was a personal GitHub account of an AWS employee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is a textbook example of why adversaries target CI/CD environments: a subtle, easily overlooked flaw that can be exploited for massive impact. We've seen this exact pattern in the recent Nx S1ngularity and Amazon Q supply-chain attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trend is no accident. Attackers are increasingly drawn to CI/CD systems because they represent an ideal target:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re complex, making them prone to subtle misconfigurations;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They handle untrusted data, often testing code from external contributors;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re highly privileged, requiring powerful credentials to access code, publish artifacts, and deploy to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination of complexity, untrusted data, and privileged credentials creates a perfect storm for high-impact breaches that require no prior access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The success of recent attacks serves as a critical wake-up call. Adversaries have already shifted their focus to CI/CD pipelines, and defenders are trailing behind. Addressing this threat requires a joint effort: organizations need to reduce pipeline privileges and implement stricter build gates, and CI/CD platforms should make these secure baselines straightforward to adopt. For security teams, the first step is to enforce a simple yet powerful principle: untrusted contributions should never trigger privileged pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Statement from AWS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS investigated all reported concerns highlighted by Wiz’s research team in "Infiltrating the AWS Console Supply Chain: Hijacking Core AWS GitHub Repositories via CodeBuild." In response, AWS took a number of steps to mitigate all issues discovered by Wiz, as well as additional steps and mitigations to protect against similar possible future issues. The core issue of actor ID bypass due to unanchored regexes for the identified repos was mitigated within 48 hours of first disclosure. Additional mitigations were implemented, including further protections of all build processes that contain Github tokens or any other credentials in memory. In addition, AWS audited all other public build environments to ensure that no such issues exist across the AWS open source estate. Finally, AWS audited the logs of all public build repositories as well as associated CloudTrail logs and determined that no other actor had taken advantage of the unanchored regex issue demonstrated by the Wiz research team. AWS determined there was no impact of the identified issue on the confidentiality or integrity of any customer environment or any AWS service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Wiz’s research team for their work in identifying this issue and their responsible collaboration with us to ensure that our customers remain protected and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;CVEs affecting the Svelte ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to upgrade&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve released patches for 5 vulnerabilities across &lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/adapter-node&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Upgrade now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using any of these packages, upgrade them to their corresponding non-vulnerable versions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;5.6.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;5.46.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;2.49.5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/adapter-node&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;5.5.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For cross-dependent packages — &lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt; depend on &lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt; — patched versions already include upgraded dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Commentary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re extremely thankful to all of the security researchers who responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities and worked with us to get them fixed, to the security team at Vercel who helped us navigate the disclosure process, and to the maintainers who worked to publish the fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a spate of high profile vulnerabilities affecting popular tools across the web development ecosystem. While they are unfortunate, it has been encouraging to see the community pulling together to keep end users safe. Using the lessons learned from these vulnerabilities, we will invest in processes that will help catch future bugs during the writing and review phases, before they go live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you have discovered a vulnerability in a package maintained by the Svelte team, we urge you to privately report it via the Security tab on the repo in question (or the Svelte repo, if unsure).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full reports are available in the published security advisories, but we’ve included a brief summary of each below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some Firewire SCSI adapters. Sometimes older Firewire tape drives have internal SCSI to Firewire boards. I've used them to with old SCSI CD drives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've got a mac with a pci-e slot, you can get a pci-e card off ebay and an appropriate stack of adapters to go from a modern wide cable to whatever you need? If you don't have a mac with a pci-e slot, borrow a desktop pc with a slot and go from there? If you borrow an old enough desktop with PCI you might be able to get an older scsi controller and skip a few chains in the cable adapter path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or using the bluescsi initiator mode to make a disk image seems not too badly priced either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GBSCSI and ZuluSCSI support “initiator mode” that can be used to either image an attached SCSI disk to a file on an SD card or provide live access to it over USB as a mass storage device—with better performance than the old USB 1.1 SCSI adapters too, which top out at about 750KB/sec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at "scsi to usb" on amazon.com, most of the options I see are SATA, IDE or even parallel printer port adapters, but nothing which allows a SCSI device to be connected to a USB port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm, what I see on Amazon is a lot of USB-to-SATA adapters, not SCSI. eBay has used, old USB-to-SCSI adapters, which is one of the options that's sometimes recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;very much not on topic, but that reminded me: my first PC (286) miraculously had a 40MB 2.5" Apple-branded HDD connected via SCSI adapter. Who knows where it was sourced from. One weird thing was that it initialized on boot for about 40 seconds, displaying nothing. I've been really surprised later seeing how fast other PCs with ATA drives were to boot. I still wonder, and maybe someone has a clue why init was so long? Is it something inherent to SCSI?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For contrast, I had an Amiga with a 120MB Maxtor SCSI drive, and power-on to looking at the loaded Workbench GUI was about 6-7 seconds. The slowest part was waiting for the drive to spin up, which seems like an acceptable reason for a delay. Warm reboots were a few seconds faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So no, that's not anything inherent to SCSI. It could've been either the SCSI driver being slow to initialize, or the adapter being glacial, or the drive itself taking forever to come online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing to do with SCSI itself, possibly a long time out polling for devices. Some dumb firmware would do silly things like poll each possible target ID and wait for a timeout in series. 6 possible devices on an old early SPI bus times a 5 seconds each is getting you in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having flashbacks to troubleshooting bus termination on DEC equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been 10-11 at the time, and half the games I had didn't have an obvious "quit" menu option. I hated pressing the hardware "reset" button because it meant waiting for a minute again, staring at the BIOS setup screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time I figured out a weird hidden keyboard combination to exit from yet another game was a happy day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need to connect them physically, I think you're blocked by HBA chipset support in macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a path, but it's not what I'd call "good". Thunderbolt to Firewire to SCSI. It's a dongle Rapunzel and you're reliant on device enclosures for power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;May be better with a native PCI-e or PCI HBA and 700W power supply and a junker ATX Linux machine to provide network shares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could do "network shares" as in mount the filesystem from Linux and export over Samba/NFS/etc; it would probably also be possible to export the drive as an iSCSI device and mount HFS(+) filesystems directly from the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; May be better with a native PCI-e or PCI HBA and 700W power supply and a junker ATX Linux machine to provide network shares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agreed. Even if it's possible to get a combination of adapters to allow a SCSI interface to be attached to a Mac (and assuming the correct driver support is present), I think getting an old PC and an old SCSI adapter card may be cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I considered the Linux box solution, and fear you're probably right, but it just feels like such a waste... for something that should be so simple with all this Mac Book horse power and Thunderbolt interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's pretty delightful, to think of someone using a computer as such a pure tool like that (as opposed to a distraction machine as is so often the case).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to imagine the author finally hit the limit of the 20MB hard drive, then decided, "you know what, rather than put 2 spaces after periods, I'll replace them all with a single space like the kids do", saving 400KB, and making room for at least a couple more weeks of work while shopping for a new computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm fairly confident you could string it together as a scsi-to-firewire-to-thunderbolt chain, potentially with a TB2/miniDP-to-TB3+ adapter as well, but this seems even worse to me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;‘ELITE’: The Palantir App ICE Uses to Find Neighborhoods to Raid&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Internal ICE material and testimony from an official obtained by 404 Media provides the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is racial profiling on a grand scale:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It apparently looks a lot like Google Maps, but designed to show the richness of an area for “targets”, populated in part by density of immigrants. And then you can dig in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“Once a person is selected on the map interface, ELITE then shows a dossier on that particular person, according to the user guide. That includes their name, a photo, their Alien Number (the unique code given by the U.S. government to each immigrant), their date of birth, and their full address.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nazis could only dream of having such a capability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine working for this company, on this product. Every day, you go into work, in what I assume is a beautiful office with pine furniture and a well-stocked kitchen, and you build software that will help to deport people using what you know are extrajudicial means without due process. You probably have OKRs. There are customer calls with ICE. Every two-week sprint, you take on tasks that help make this engine better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you tell yourself? What do you tell your family?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you on board with this agenda, or do you tell yourself you need the job to pay rent? To get healthcare?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You receive stock as part of your pay package. It’s going up! You can use it to buy a home, or to build a comfortable retirement, or some combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your co-workers are values aligned and work hard. They’re talented and smart. Man, you might think to yourself, I love working with this team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, you might think, man, I’ve got to find another job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either way, you’re proud of your product work. You’re happy to take the salary, the free lunches, the espresso. And regardless of how you feel about it, the thing you do every day is powering an armed force that is kidnapping people on the street and shooting civilians, that shot a mother in the face, that is targeting people to disappear using a beautiful, modern map interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Link]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS is a high-performance POSIX file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage (e.g. Amazon S3), and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;📖 Document: Quick Start Guide&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully POSIX-compatible: Use as a local file system, seamlessly docking with existing applications without breaking business workflow.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully Hadoop-compatible: JuiceFS' Hadoop Java SDK is compatible with Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x as well as a variety of components in the Hadoop ecosystems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;S3-compatible: JuiceFS' S3 Gateway provides an S3-compatible interface.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloud Native: A Kubernetes CSI Driver is provided for easily using JuiceFS in Kubernetes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shareable: JuiceFS is a shared file storage that can be read and written by thousands of clients.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strong Consistency: The confirmed modification will be immediately visible on all the servers mounted with the same file system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outstanding Performance: The latency can be as low as a few milliseconds, and the throughput can be expanded nearly unlimitedly (depending on the size of the Object Storage). Test results&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Encryption: Supports data encryption in transit and at rest (please refer to the guide for more information).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global File Locks: JuiceFS supports both BSD locks (flock) and POSIX record locks (fcntl).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Compression: JuiceFS supports LZ4 or Zstandard to compress all your data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS consists of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JuiceFS Client: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Storage: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metadata Engine: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. Learn more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each file stored in JuiceFS is split into "Chunk" s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more "Slice"(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed "Block" s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. Learn more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don't panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you begin, make sure you have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One supported metadata engine, see How to Set Up Metadata Engine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One supported Object Storage for storing data blocks, see Supported Object Storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JuiceFS Client downloaded and installed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please refer to Quick Start Guide to start using JuiceFS right away!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out all the command line options in command reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS can be used as a persistent volume for Docker and Podman, please check here for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also very easy to use JuiceFS on Kubernetes. Please find more information here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aside from the POSIX features covered by pjdfstest, JuiceFS also provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Close-to-open consistency. Once a file is written and closed, it is guaranteed to view the written data in the following opens and reads from any client. Within the same mount point, all the written data can be read immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rename and all other metadata operations are atomic, which are guaranteed by supported metadata engine transaction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Opened files remain accessible after unlink from same mount point.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS provides a subcommand that can run a few basic benchmarks to help you understand how it works in your environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sequential read/write benchmark has also been performed on JuiceFS, EFS and S3FS by fio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above result figure shows that JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two (see more details).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple mdtest benchmark has been performed on JuiceFS, EFS and S3FS by mdtest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result shows that JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two (see more details).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS supports many Object Storage services. Please check out this list first. If the Object Storage you want to use is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting any issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Since v1.0.0 Beta3 JuiceFS supports the use of Redis Cluster as the metadata engine, but it should be noted that Redis Cluster requires that the keys of all operations in a transaction must be in the same hash slot, so a JuiceFS file system can only use one hash slot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK just pulled off one of its most consequential offshore wind auctions yet – delivering massive volumes of new capacity at prices that undercut gas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In its latest offshore wind allocation round (AR7), the UK awarded a record 8.4 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity, making it the largest-ever offshore wind auction in Europe. That includes 8.2 GW of bottom‑fixed projects and just under 200 megawatts (MW) of floating wind, enough clean power to supply the equivalent of nearly 10 million homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it came in cheap. Thanks to intense competition, the average strike prices landed at £91.20 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in England and Wales and £89.49/MWh in Scotland. That’s well below the cost of building and running new fossil fuel or nuclear power in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For context, new gas plants in the UK are estimated to cost approximately £147/MWh, while new nuclear power plants come in at around £124/MWh. In other words, offshore wind from this auction is roughly 40% cheaper than gas and almost 30% cheaper than nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 8.4 GW of new offshore wind capacity will save consumers nearly £1.7 billion a year compared with relying on gas-fired power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A highly competitive auction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AR7 was one of the most competitive offshore wind auctions ever held in Europe. A record 19 projects with a combined potential capacity of 24 GW were eligible to bid, driving prices down and underscoring just how far offshore wind costs have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, the auction awarded contracts to six bottom‑fixed offshore wind projects and two floating wind projects. The 192 MW of floating wind awarded may sound small, but it’s an important step toward advancing commercial‑scale floating wind – a technology seen as critical for deeper waters where traditional turbines won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The British government says the auction will unlock around £22 billion in private investment and support roughly 7,000 jobs across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;RWE walks away the big winner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The clear standout in this round was German energy giant RWE, which secured contracts for nearly 7 GW of offshore wind capacity – by far the largest share of the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said, “With these results, Britain is taking back control of our energy sovereignty. This is a historic win for those who want Britain to stand on our own two feet, controlling our own energy rather than depending on markets controlled by petrostates and dictators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is a monumental step toward clean power by 2030, and the price secured in this auction is 40% lower than the alternative cost of building and operating a new gas plant.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"new nuclear power plants come in at around £124/MWh"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Higher than that. The strike price for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant is £92.50, in 2012 prices, and adjusted for inflation. So that's around £134/MWh as of 2025. By the time the plant is actually finally connected to the grid (2030-2031?), that could be over £160/MWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you look at it through the lens of energy security, consumer savings, or climate goals, AR7 sends a pretty clear message: Offshore wind is one of the UK’s cheapest ways to build new large‑scale power.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;They're just so much sharper and more pleasant to use than your average drug store nail clippers, you can really feel the quality. I can barely stand regular nail clippers now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of my best purchases were outdoor clothing I bought some 7 years ago on a whim. I constantly regret not getting some 10 of them, and sadly they don't make these anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Thermal inner pants from Berghaus - Knitted thermal jacket from Salewa&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A no name Espresso machine. I got it as a gift but I doubt it was much more than $100. It works great. I had always assumed I would regret not buying a super expensive one, but it turns out you can have great espresso for not much money.&lt;/p&gt;
