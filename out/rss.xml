    &lt;p&gt;IPv4 addresses have run out! It would have been fashionable to make this claim in 2011 when the last of the IPv4 addresses in the ‘free pool’ were allocated. It took several years, but today most of those remaining addresses are accounted for. How has the distribution and use of these last addresses been made in comparison to what was once commonly referred to as the IPv4 address swamp? Has IPv4 allocation and assignment changed for the better in the 21st century? Or are the prefixes getting smaller and even more diverse? What implications might this have on Internet security?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside of its historical context, we rarely refer to swamp space any longer. Why is this? Perhaps it is because the majority of the IPv4 address space now closely resembles what was once an outlier in address management, organization, and structure? Perhaps there is a new swamp, just like the old swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key findings&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The legacy address ‘swamp’ is what a lot of the address space now resembles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Address registrations and routes are growing in number, while prefix sizes are getting smaller.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Address volatility greatly affects the performance of threat mitigation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1990s and well into the 21st century, network operators often referred to a portion of the IPv4 address space as ‘The Swamp’. As far as we know, the phrase was never formally defined, but it was commonly used to refer to a subset of allocations in the original classful C address hierarchy. In practice, small /24 assignments first came out of 192/8, the start of the class C block. The negative connotation implied by the word ‘swamp’ suggests dirty, dishevelled, and inefficient. In terms of IP address management and routing, these attributes often fit. Network operators worried that if trends continued, the size of routing tables would quickly overwhelm router capacity. By the early 21st century, approximately 80% of the 192/8 address space was already assigned, and much of it was seen in the Internet routing tables as many disaggregated /24 routes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sheer number and diverse assignments of these /24 prefixes effectively prohibited address aggregation. Over time, the routing system evolved to handle an ever-increasing number of prefixes, but few, if any, routers from the early days would be able to load and compute the routing tables that exist today. Small prefixes and the routing table entries continue to grow. As of this writing, a full IPv4 routing table is approximately 1 million entries. Two decades prior, there were only 150,000 routes. When people suggest the Internet is a collection of loosely cooperating Autonomous Systems, the swamp might have been considered ‘exhibit A’, foreshadowing the new normal of IPv4 addressing disorganization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last of the /8 IPv4 address allocations from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) were made in 2011. Obtaining previously unassigned IPv4 addresses is now becoming a thing of the past. IPv4 address scarcity has led to a variety of reactions from users and the market. Large blocks of assigned IPv4 addresses (/16 or larger) are routinely transferred from one holder to another for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Waiting lists and address-leasing companies are now part of the IPv4 address assignment landscape. Many organizations with lots of addresses in the legacy Class A or B networks have split them up or transferred them to the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is well known that the big cloud providers, such as Amazon and Microsoft, have gobbled up many IPv4 address blocks on the market, divvying them up across their global data centre infrastructure. Network Address Translators (NATs) continue to be widely used and relied upon. Interest in and deployment growth of IPv6 addressing continues to grow every year. We began to wonder about all these changes, especially considering how the IPv4 address space structure and organization have changed. The implications the new normal has on routing are obvious, but less well understood is what effect these changes have had on address and network reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we don’t use the term swamp anymore because, increasingly, the entire IPv4 address space has all the telltale signs of the original swamp?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The last of the free pool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IP address assignment for small address blocks in the original class C hierarchy was primarily first drawn from 192/8 and almost entirely in /24 chunks at a time. A /24 prefix is widely observed to be the smallest block of addresses that can be successfully announced and seen by most Internet routers. At the turn of the century, approximately 10% of the total number of IPv4 route table entries may have come from just the sub-prefixes in 192/8 alone. Then and today, all /24 route advertisements account for more than 50% of all routing table entries, although the trend hovers closer to 60% today. See Figure 1 for a recent look at the IPv4 routing table by prefix size distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2011, IANA distributed the last five remaining IPv4 /8 blocks of addresses to each of the RIRs (AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE). We wondered if registration and assignment of prefixes would resemble the 192/8 swamp or something different. Understanding how these new blocks of previously unallocated addresses were distributed might give us clues about general IPv4 addressing usage trends in other portions of the address space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Registries denote a status for the address space they manage. For our purposes, we focus on address blocks RIRs have designated as assigned or allocated. The former is when an address block has been delegated from the RIR to an end user, such as an ISP, while the latter suggests it hasn’t yet been assigned but is available for distribution. However, we have found that the distinction between these two states is often unclear. We group both types of address blocks together for simplicity, imperfect as this may be. Other designations can include ‘available’ and ‘reserved’, which we ignore in our analysis unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of 2011, there were very few allocations and assignments made from these five blocks. By 2014, two registries, the RIPE NCC and LACNIC, had allocated or assigned almost all this new address space, APNIC and ARIN, about one-third, and AFRINIC had yet to make any registrations. Today, all RIRs have allocated and assigned most, if not practically all, addresses in the last /8s from the remaining free pool. See tables 1, 2, and 3 below for details.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;RIPE&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;185&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16,677,888&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;99%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could have guessed that practically all available IPv4 addresses would ultimately be put to use. We can observe some patterns in the rate of allocation and assignment by RIR, which may say something about the demand in their regions and their distribution policies. However, what might be more useful to see is the size of blocks of addresses within these last free pools as they are allocated, assigned, and routed. We know that address registrations and routing are often incongruous, but we can get a sense of the structure, especially compared with the 192/8 block, to see whether or not usage for all the address space gravitates toward one recognizable pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Figure 2 below, we plot the distribution of address block sizes for the last five free pool allocations from IANA (102/8, 103/8, 104/8, 179/8, and 185/8) in 2014. We separate them by their corresponding registry. Note, it is possible that a registrant moved its assignment to another registry, but this is relatively uncommon, and we don’t believe it markedly alters any observations made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AFRINIC had not yet begun distributing prefixes from its 102/8 at that time. For the others, the average size of the prefix varied but tended toward the small side of around /22 for all registries. The picture changes slightly when we fast-forward to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2024, AFRINIC had distributed the majority of its 102/8 address pool. The average size of address blocks from APNIC and RIPE appears to have remained largely unchanged. ARIN and LACNIC, however, appear to now have smaller blocks than 10 years ago. Also note RIPE appears to have a few block registrations smaller than a /24. The reasons for this can vary, but often contiguous ‘micro’ registrations are ultimately assigned to the same entity that chooses to separately manage even smaller portions of a larger address space block. Figure 3 below compares the distribution of block size registration with legacy 192/8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The majority of 192/8 address space is currently managed by ARIN, but a sizeable portion is managed by the RIPE NCC and other smaller portions by the remaining registries. In Figure 4, we can clearly see block sizes tend toward a /24. This is not particularly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also note that blocks of addresses are often reserved throughout the entire IPv4 address space. For example, 192.168.0.0/16, you may know, is reserved for private use as defined in IETF RFC 1918 — address allocation for private Internets. This sub-prefix is not allocated or managed by any of the RIRs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Address registration paints a partial picture of distribution and usage. We can draw a more complete picture by considering how blocks of addresses appear in the Internet routing tables. We will limit our scope here to a recent view of an Internet routing table at the end of 2024. We can then make some comparisons to what appears in the registries and what appears in a typical routing table. There is often overlap, but the two are incongruent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Considering Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that the last free pool blocks IANA delegated to the RIRs eventually became nearly completely assigned and allocated. Nearly 80% of legacy 192/8 blocks were accounted for by as early as 2004. With practically all the address space in these six /8s assigned and allocated, we would expect this to be reflected in the Internet’s routing tables. Something interesting appears, however, when you compare IP address registration and IP address routing. Except in the case of route leaks or hijacking, we might expect the coverage of these address spaces in the routing table to lag registration. The difference, however, is quite striking. We’ve reconstructed the tables this time with the 192/8 prefix and routing information added (see tables 4 through 6 below).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;legacy&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;192&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16,585,728&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;99%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14,526&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10,320,960&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;62%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tables provide a clearer picture of IP address assignment and usage. Independently, registration and routes follow a similar trend. Their numbers increase over time. The differences, however, are stark. The number of routes covering 192/8 in 2024 was a little over 14,000, but the proportion of the address space these routes covered was only slightly more than 62% of the total possible, which means nearly two-fifths of the 192/8 address pool is not directly reachable on the Internet. As we’ve mentioned, there are reserved allocations in this range, but their numbers would not make up for the bulk of missing routes. All last free pool /8s have better route coverage in 2024. We could make some educated guesses or conduct more analysis to understand why, but we believe ultimately it comes down to the ‘legacy’ of 192/8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More interesting to us is not just that the last free pool space is more accessible, but that the number of routes covering each varies significantly. For example, we see more than 42,000 routes covering the 103/8 (APNIC) block, but only slightly fewer than 6,000 for 179/8 (LACNIC), and the latter covers nearly 100% of /8 while only 72% of APNIC’s 103/8 is covered. What is going on here? A look back at Figure 4 gives a clue. LACNIC’s assignment of addresses in its /8 tends to be larger than APNIC’s, and this is ultimately reflected in routing. Consequently, we see a lot more smaller prefixes such as /23s and /24s for APNIC prefixes in the routing table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another observation that lends support to this article’s thesis is that the last of the free pool /8s looks surprisingly like a swamp when compared with the original 192/8 swamp. There are many small registrations and routes to many different entities. What distinguishes the legacy swamp from the modern swamp seems to be little more than age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Recommendations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To detect and mitigate abusive, ever-changing networks of varying size and duration, we recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real-time visibility into volumetric traffic floods and distributed attack patterns. Tools such as NETSCOUT Arbor Sightline can help surface early signs of trouble and trigger flow specification and Remotely Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) defences to upstream providers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proactive mitigation with automated systems such as Arbor Threat Mitigation System (TMS) or Arbor Edge Defense (AED). These can stop both volumetric floods and more complex, multivector attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intelligence-driven defence with feeds such as NETSCOUT’s ATLAS Intelligence Feed (AIF). These provide context information, what’s trending, who’s being targeted, and how actors are evolving.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staying ahead of threat actors is an ever-changing job and requires a broad view of where these attacks come from, how they operate, and where they could strike next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know IP address prefixes have become increasingly transient. That is, prefixes move from registrant to registrant, often across the world after an exchange. As modern IP address volatility proliferates, an association of activity and reputation with addresses rapidly changes as well. An address block used by a low-cost hosting provider has a very different profile than when that address is used by end users on Wi-Fi hot spots, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have been experiencing increasing Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, scanning, scraping, proxy, and address reputation volatility in our data for a while now. You probably have as well. This instability in address/reputation pairing has implications for how well security threat mitigation services can perform. There is a risk for false positives, false negatives, over-blocking, and under-blocking. This is an area of work we are increasingly focused on to help better understand and respond to security threats in this new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The e-scooter isn’t new – London was zooming around on Autopeds a century ago&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The e-scooters that clutter up pavements may seem like a new thing, but a hundred years ago, there were already people zooming around London on powered scooters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These were the Autoped, an American import that was once popular enough to regularly appear in the newspapers before vanishing seemingly without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invented in the USA in 1915, they first appeared in London in 1917, despite a ban on imports during WWI, and really took off when the import ban was lifted in 1919.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By today’s standards, they look like a bargain, selling for just £36, although that’s actually about £1,600 in today’s money, so they were really aimed at the wealthy buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gamage’s, the people’s emporium, described them as being made for everybody who feels the necessity of making the most of time, of conserving health and energy, and keeping travelling expenses down to the minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was said to be able to reach speeds of 10mph, and unlike modern versions, the Autoped was powered by petrol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(There was apparently an electric version by Eveready, but it might have been only in the USA)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comfort over rough roads, they were fitted with 15-inch-diameter pneumatic tyres. The Lady magazine suggested the Autoped would make for a more suitable alternative to the motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They even played a key role in a silent movie, At Sword’s Point, about an annoying man who refuses to say no when rebuffed by a lady and, when trying to escape the relatives, steals an Autoped but collides with his pursuer, also on an Autoped. An “explosion followed, and they both disappeared”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His Majesty’s government wasn’t going to be left behind either, and there was a report in the Pall Mall Gazette of a “distinguished looking autopedist, gracefully erect” sweeping down Whitehall delivering parcels to 10 Downing Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;American Miss Shirley Kellogg brings new motor scooter invention to England. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, by 1922, the adverts aren’t by Gammages, but by owners selling them off cheaply in the classified ads. Several noted that the owners were switching to a car instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that the British weather might have killed off the Autoped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But finally, to that famous image of a lady on an Autoped – it’s of Lady Florence Priscilla Norman, a noted suffragist and was given the Autoped by her husband, the Liberal MP, Henry Norman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just think, had the Autoped lingered on for a few more years and become more affordable as manufacturing increased, how different the streets of our cities could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google's year in review: 8 areas with research breakthroughs in 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 has been a year of extraordinary progress in research. With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Delivering breakthroughs on world-class models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, we significantly advanced our model capabilities with breakthroughs on reasoning, multimodal understanding, model efficiency, and generative capabilities, beginning with the release of Gemini 2.5 in March and culminating in the November launch of Gemini 3 and the December launch of Gemini 3 Flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro is our most powerful model to date, designed to help you bring any idea to life. It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’re committed to making useful AI technology accessible, with state-of-the-art open models. We built our Gemma family of models to be lightweight and open for public use; this year we were able to introduce multimodal capabilities, significantly increase the context window, expand multilingual capabilities, and improve efficiency and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about this year’s advances in Gemma models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Innovating and transforming our products with AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, we continued to advance the trajectory of AI from tool to utility, transforming our portfolio of products with new, powerful agentic capabilities. We reimagined software development by moving beyond tools that assist coding to introducing powerful, agentic systems that collaborate with developers. Key advances, such as the impressive coding capabilities in Gemini 3 and the launch of Google Antigravity, mark a new era in AI-assisted software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about this year’s advances building developer tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This evolution was also clear across our core products, from AI-enabled features on the Pixel 10 and updates to AI Mode in Search, to AI-first innovations like the Gemini app and NotebookLM, which gained advanced features like Deep Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about how we’ve transformed our products with AI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Empowering creativity and co-creating with AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 was a transformative year for generative media, giving people new and unprecedented capabilities to realize their creative ambitions. Generative media models and tools for video, images, audio and worlds became more effective and broadly used, with breakouts Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro offering unprecedented capabilities for native image generation and editing. We worked with people in creative industries to develop tools like Flow and Music AI Sandbox, making them more helpful for creative workflows, and we expanded creative possibilities for people with new, AI-powered experiences in the Google Arts &amp;amp; Culture lab, major upgrades to image editing within the Gemini app, and the introduction of powerful new generative media models like Veo 3.1, Imagen 4 and Flow.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As research breakthroughs continue to expand AI’s capabilities, Google Labs is where we share AI experiments as we develop them – hearing from users and evolving as we learn. Some of this year’s most engaging experiments from Labs: Pomelli, an AI experiment for on-brand marketing content; Stitch, which introduced a way to turn prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes; Jules, an asynchronous coding agent that acts as a collaborative partner for developers; and Google Beam, a 3D video communications platform that used AI to advance the possibilities of remote presence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Advancing science and mathematics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2025 was also a banner year for scientific advances with AI, marked by breakthroughs in life sciences, health, natural sciences, and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the space of a year, we made progress in building AI resources and tools that empower researchers and help them understand, identify, and develop treatments in healthcare. In genomics, where we’ve been applying advanced technology to research for 10 years, we moved beyond sequencing, using AI to interpret the most complex data. We also marked the 5-year anniversary of AlphaFold, the Nobel-winning AI system that solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. AlphaFold has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shaping innovations in computing and the physical world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also leading major discoveries and shaping the future of science in areas like quantum computing, energy and moonshots. Research in this area drew new levels of public attention, with progress towards real-world applications of quantum computing as demonstrated by Quantum Echoes and, notably, Googler Michel Devoret becoming a 2025 Physics Nobel Laureate along with former Googler John Martinis and UC Berkeley’s John Clarke, for their foundational 1980s quantum research.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, we continued to advance the core infrastructure that powers our AI, focusing on breakthroughs in hardware design and improving energy efficiency. This included the introduction of Ironwood, a new TPU built for the age of inference, which was designed using a method called AlphaChip, alongside a commitment to measuring the environmental impact of our technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about how we’re using AI to develop chips, infrastructure and improve energy efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our work in robotics and visual understanding brought AI agents into both the physical and virtual worlds, with advancements like the foundational Gemini Robotics models, the more sophisticated Gemini Robotics 1.5, and the introduction of Genie 3 as a new frontier for general-purpose world models.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tackling global challenges and opportunities at scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our work throughout 2025 demonstrates how AI-enabled scientific progress is being directly applied to address the world's most critical and pervasive challenges. By leveraging state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning, we are significantly increasing our understanding of the planet and its systems, while also delivering impactful solutions in areas vital to human flourishing, including climate resilience, public health and education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we are using state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning to help increase our understanding of the planet, helping enable work that is making a difference in people’s lives now from weather predictions to urban planning to public health. For example, our flood forecasting information now covers more than two billion people in 150 countries for severe riverine floods. And our most advanced and efficient forecasting model, WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster and with resolution up to 1-hour. Using this technology, we’ve supported weather agencies in making decisions based on a range of scenarios through our experimental cyclone predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AI is proving to be a powerful tool in education, enabling new forms of understanding and expanding curiosity through initiatives like LearnLM and Guided Learning in Gemini. We brought Gemini’s most powerful translation capabilities to Google Translate, enabling much smarter, more natural and accurate translations and piloting new speech to speech translation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prioritizing responsibility and safety&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We couple our research breakthroughs with rigorous and forward-looking work on responsibility and safety. As our models grow more capable, we’re continuing to advance and evolve our tools, resources and safety frameworks to anticipate and mitigate risk. Gemini 3 demonstrated this approach in action: it's our most secure model yet, and has undergone the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date. And we’re looking further ahead, exploring a responsible path to AGI, prioritizing readiness, proactive risk assessment, and collaboration with the wider AI community.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Leading frontier collaborations with industry, academia and civil society&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advancing the frontier of AI responsibly demands collaboration across all parts of society. In 2025, we worked with leading AI labs to help to form the Agentic AI Foundation and support open standards to ensure a responsible and interoperable future for agentic AI. In education, we’ve partnered with school districts like Miami Dade County and education groups like Raspberry Pi to equip students with AI skills. Our research partnerships with universities like UC Berkeley, Yale, the University of Chicago and many more have been instrumental to some of this year’s most exciting frontier research, and we’re working with the US Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories to transform how scientific research is conducted. And we’re working with filmmakers and other creative visionaries to put the best AI tools in their hands and explore storytelling in the age of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Avoid Mini-frameworks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work in Google Ads infrastructure in the past four years. Over time, I've seen one pattern came along again and again, causing endless pain for developers, that is, creating mini-frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is mini-framework?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I'd like to give readers a sense of what I mean by "mini-frameworks". Imagine a company that has 1000 engineers, and they share the same tech stack. Over time, a team finds the shared tech stack unsatisfactory, either because they have to write boilerplate code over and over, or the performance is not good enough, or whatever. So they decided to create their own framework on top of the shared stack. You know it's a framework and not just a library, when you hear engineers present the work using concepts they invented, as a way to actualize their mental model. Framework like this is what I called "mini-framework", with some common characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Created by a small number of team(s) to solve their pain points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wraps around the company/org-shared tech stack or framework&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Introduce new concepts that doesn't exist in the original stack&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creators claim that the framework "magically" solves many problems, and push more people to use it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you work for a big company, most likely you've seen or even done this. But why is it bad? Being a victim myself, I can share my story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, my team has been using a Google-internal framework to write distributed programs, and are gradually migrating our org's codebase onto it. This framework is well-designed and maintained by a dedicated team. We're generally happy with it, though it has some itchy points (not pain points). Being a strong and ambitious engineer, my manager proposed that we add an abstraction layer on top of it, with the aim to lower the barrier for org adoption, and solve those itchy points on the way. I was skeptical and tried convincing my manager not to do it, but failed. Eventually, several engineers spent quarters to add this abstraction layer, and now the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, one author tried to adopt it in our existing codebase. People thought it would be easy, but it took like a year. Why? Because during the migration, they found that the abstraction cannot handle certain use cases, so they have to spend time patching it to make it work. In the meantime, other people like me were writing new code using the original framework, this again added new requirements and workload for migration. Eventually, after spending way more time than initially planned, the migration completed, and my manager decided that newly-written code should use our own framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You think this is the end? Of course not!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I started writing code with the new framework, there wasn't a single time that I didn't want to curse and quit the job. The framework is so hard to use, it introduced so many concepts with the intent to hide complexity, but ended up bringing more. Since I'm not the person who writes it, I'm not familiar with all tricks and hacks. As a result, what used to cost me a day to finish can now take two weeks, plus I have to constantly ask the author how to do certain things, and even booked pair-programming sessions. As I heard, other team members were having the same complaints. As for the original goal of driving adoption, ofc it didn't help (if not slower). What's funny is that, this layer is supposed to make people outside of our team write code more easily, but now even our own team are suffering from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back, part of the problem was caused by bad design and implementation, but the fundamental problem lies in creating the mini-framework in the first place. I've observed other mini-frameworks, they all sort of have the same problem, just some worse than the others. So I've come up with a few thoughts to explain why mini-frameworks are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why mini-frameworks are bad?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, mini-frameworks lacks feature completeness and compatibility. People often think that they can magically "hide the unnecessary complexity", but in reality they can't. Even if the mini-framework can deal with 80% use cases well, they often lack the flexibility and features from the original framework to satisfy the rest 20%. DSL (Domain Specific Language) shares the same problem, and that's why people hate it so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, mini-frameworks violates the ETC (Easier To Change) principle. I first learned the concept from the legendary book The Pragmatic Programmer, and it still astonishes me that many programmers (even experienced ones) are not aware of it. Put simply, it suggests to write code in a way that allows future modifications be made easily. Creating mini-frameworks violates this principle in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The mini-framework only models the current use cases to solve certain problems. When requirements change in the future, it often cannot keep up with it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating mini-framework often requires poking into the implementation details of the original framework, and those details were abstracted away for good reason: they can change at any time. The more implementation details that are relied upon, the harder for the maintaining team to evolve the original framework.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, mini-frameworks is a realization of the creator's mental model, but it's not everyone's mental model. People who tend to create mini-framework are often more opinionated, which is a good thing by itself. But when you create things for others to use, too opinionated can be a bad thing. I would even say that sometimes (not always), creating a mini framework directly reflects the author's ego, and they chose a framework because a tiny library don't recognize the "significance of the work".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, mini-frameworks tend to cause tech stack fragmentation. I generated an image to show what I mean: part of the system is migrated, others are not. As new layers kept being added, over time it gets worse. Not sure if other companies are like this, but at Google, I've never actually seen a code migration fully complete, which is kinda hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but also the most concerning: lack of maintenance. Unlike shared infrastructure owned by dedicated teams, mini-frameworks were often owned by those 1 or 2 people who created it. Once they left the team or company, it becomes really hard to find successors — sure other team members may know roughly how things work, but certainly not as deep as the authors. Also, people lack the motivation to maintain existing stuff, because you don't get paid more or promoted doing this. Therefore, mini frameworks often die with the departure of the original authors, unless it has gained major adoption before that, which happens less likely than not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So, What Should You Do Instead?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, it's important to clarify what I'm against and what I'm not. I'm certainly not against adding abstractions——because abstractions are essentially, the program itself, we can't live without it. I'm against adding abstractions in a wrong way, and in the form that's not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me bring this up once again since it's really important: The real and only difference between a library and a framework, is whether it introduces new concepts. The line can be blurry sometimes, but more often you can tell easily. For example, a library can include a set of subclasses or utility functions around the original framework, as they don't introduce new concepts. But if you see a README that starts with a "Glossary" section, you know it's 99.99% chance a framework (people may still refer to them as "libraries", but you get the idea).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My point is, we should be really really careful introducing new concepts. If you can, avoid it. The cognitive load brought by a bunch of buzz words is heavier than people realized, and especially, what the framework author can realize. Words are the mirror of someone's thought, same with code. The authors create concepts because it is how they model the problem inside their brain, it is how they think. That's why they claim the concepts are "natural and straightforward", while others are struggling to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So rule No.1, avoid creating mini-frameworks, create libraries instead. But in the cases where you do find it necessary to create a framework, my suggestions are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Link concepts to concrete business requirements, not something in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start fresh. Don't build a wrapper around the existing framework, build your own from scratch. Yes this would make it a major decision that requires more discussions and resources, but it avoids many of the aforementioned issues. After all, you have good business justification to do this, right.. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take it seriously. Having seen many disasters caused by mini-frameworks, I can't help thinking if it's because people didn't take it seriously enough. My feeling is that, since people don't really understand the distinction between a library and a framework, both the initiator and reviewers of the decision tend to underthink it: "Oh it's just another abstraction, we do that all the time". As my story shows, it's really not. Creating and adopting a framework, whether mini or not, is always a serious decision, thus should be treated that way. By realizing the seriousness of this matter, I hope we can avoid making rashy decisions to create mini-frameworks that should not exist in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; My current laptop is an aging X1 Carbon generation 7, purchased some time in mid 2019. A few months ago a few keys of the keyboard stopped working, specifically the 5, 6, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and Delete keys. Sometimes I can get it working again by
mashing one of them for a while, but it's not consistent. Given my past
experiences with X1 Carbon laptops breaking outside of warranty and the
frustration that comes with replacing their components, I decided it was time to
look for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, buying a new X1 Carbon wasn't going to be an option: when it comes to displays you now basically have two choices: a subpar not-quite-2K IPS display, or a 2.5K (ish) OLED display. Since I use my laptop for programming and often use it in low light conditions such as a living room with dimmed lights in the evening, OLED just doesn't make sense. Knowing my luck I'd also run into OLED burn-in the moment the warranty expires. There are also some other issues with the X1 line in general, such as poor CPU cooling and the absolute nightmare that is opening them up to replace parts or clean them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at some other brands but it appears that in 2025 there's just aren't many good options for Linux users. I narrowed it down to two options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buy a refurbished M1 or M2 Macbook and run Asahi Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buy a Framework&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I eliminated the use of Asahi Linux because of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The battery life doesn't appear to be all that better than conventional laptops when running Linux. This isn't entirely surprising because of a lot of the battery improvements on macOS are the result of the software and hardware integration, not just the hardware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There seem to be issues with suspend not working as well (at least based on various comments I came across), and hardware support in general is a bit dodgy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If something needs replacing I basically have an expensive paperweight, because everything is soldered together, assuming you could even find spare parts in the first place&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'm not sure Asahi as a project will still be around in 5 years, but my laptop will be&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, Framework laptops has many supposed benefits: they're upgradable, repairable, actively work on Linux and even FreeBSD support (or at least sponsor developers working on this), allow you to customize the keyboard using QMK/VIAL. In fact, on paper it sounds like the perfect developer laptop. In reality, I'm not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building the laptop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operating system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Weight&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Design&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power LED&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Battery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WiFi and Bluetooth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keyboard&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trackpad&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speakers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modular ports&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conclusion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Framework has three models of laptops: a 12 inch, 13.5 inch and 16 inch laptop. My X1 Carbon is a 14 inch laptop but I've always felt like I wanted something just slightly larger. I ended up buying the Framework 16 for two reason:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I read various reports of the Framework 13 having issues with poor battery life, fan noise, heating, etc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While 16 inch is a fair bit larger than 14 inch, I was hoping it would be manageable size wise&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The base configuration is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Framework 16 DIY edition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: Ryzen AI 7 350&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: 2x8 GiB DDR5-5600&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSD: WD Black SN7100, 500 GiB&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also bought an additional Intel AX210 WiFi card in case the default Mediatek card would cause any trouble, as I don't trust brands other than Intel when it comes to WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shipping took about a week or so, with the laptop making quite the journey from Taiwan to the Philippines to China, then to Japan and then back to China, then to Istanbul, then to France and at last to The Netherlands. I'm not sure what happened here, maybe the pilot got drunk or perhaps Fedex' tracking is just broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building the laptop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought the DIY edition which requires some manual assembly, though not nearly as much as I feared. All I had to do was install the SSD, RAM, and the keyboard spacers. The spacers, touchpad and keyboard use magnetic connectors so installing and removing them is trivial. To access the SSD and RAM slots you need to unscrew a plate that sits between these slots and the keyboard, but this only takes a few minutes using the provided screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't measure how long it took me to install it the first time, but opening it up and putting it back together a second time only took perhaps 5-10 minutes at most. For comparison, to replace most parts of the X1 Carbon you essentially have to take the whole thing apart and unscrew countless screws many of which are hard to find. Unsurprisingly, I've lost some of these screws over the years and dreaded opening it up the few times I had to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an area where Framework excels compared to all other brands: it's just so easy to swap the parts out that it puts other brands to shame when it comes to hardware maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the operating system I initially gave FreeBSD 15 a quick try. I knew it wasn't going to be the final OS due to it still having issues with the Framework hardware (e.g. suspend doesn't work properly), but I figured it was worth a try just to see what would happen. The installation went fine and WiFi worked fine, though that was because I swapped the Mediatek card with the Intel AX210 as the Mediatek card doesn't work at all on FreeBSD. Upon loading the AMD drivers I encountered a kernel crash, likely due to the same issue as discussed in this drm-kmod issue. A laptop without working GPU drivers isn't going to work, so at this point I decided to give up on FreeBSD (again) and install Fedora 43 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fedora 43 worked just fine as expected, and everything worked, so let's take a look at the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 weights about 2.2 kg according to my kitchen scale. For comparison, my X1 Carbon weights 1.3 kg. That may not seem like a big difference, but the extra kilogram makes carrying around the Framework 16 more difficult. In particular, I don't feel comfortable carrying it with just one hand while this isn't a problem with the X1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework is best described as a bit of a chonker and I certainly don't see myself carrying it around a lot. This also gives it a bit of an identity crisis: laptops should be portable, otherwise why not just get a desktop. And yet the Framework 16 is neither portable nor remotely as powerful as a desktop, so who exactly is the target audience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of the laptop is a bit polarizing. I like the combination of black and silver, but I hate how janky it all looks and feels due to the removable spacers. Note the lines separating the touchpad from the spacers on the left and right of it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only does it look weird, you can also feel the gap and edges when resting your palm on them. The silver spacers and touchpad are also raised slightly relative to the black keyboard area, and the edges are quite sharp. If you have arm hairs you may consider shaving them off or risk getting them stuck. I also suspect gunk will build up in these edges over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spacers aren't held solid in place either, meaning you can move them around and they have a bit of flex to them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may need to turn up your volume to hear the noise the spacers make. Also, apologies for the vertical video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also a practical problem: due to the flex of the spacers if you try to hold the laptop on its sides it will actually "wobble" a bit. Combined with the weight I suspect that unless you hold on to this laptop for dear life, you will at some point drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These issues could be considered a minor issue in isolation but remember, this model costs two thousand Euros (I'll bring this up a few more times). For a premium price I expect a premium design and build quality, and this isn't it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Display&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The display isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Like most laptop displays that aren't Macbooks there's a bit of flex to the display, though this shouldn't be much of an issue. The colors of the display are overly saturated, with reds in particular looking more intense than they should. Here's a silly example of what a particular shade of red looks like on my X1 Carbon:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's the same color on the Framework 16:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that both displays were using the same brightness and the same color temperature/night light setting. For comparison, here's what those colors should look like when using a properly calibrated (at the hardware level at least) Eizo CS2740 that I use for my desktop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm aware the quality of the photos isn't great, but if you compare the Framework version to the others you'll notice the colors are more saturated compared to what they should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The white/grey uniformity also leaves a lot to be desired, though this is true for all modern IPS displays that aren't manufactured by Eizo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find non-uniform displays distracting as it can create a sort of tunnel vision effect/feeling. While the X1 Carbon also suffers from this problem, it feels less pronounced than in case of the Framework. Of course the Eizo display doesn't suffer from this problem at all (hence I bought it), but then it again it costs a ridiculous €1700.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the brightness. This display is bright, even at the lowest setting. I found various forum posts that mention the Framework 13 suffers from a similar issue but that you can at least now lower the brightness further on recent versions of Linux, but this isn't supported for the Framework 16. Here's what that looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 is on the left and the X1 Carbon on the right, both set to the lowest brightness setting that is still usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Framework 16 being so much brighter means that using it in a darker room (e.g. a living room at night with the lights dimmed) makes you feel like a deer looking into the headlights of a car that's about to run you over. In other words, not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Power LED&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the topic of brightness, the power button in the top right corner of the keyboard has an LED that can't be turned off in the BIOS. Instead, you can set it to a few different settings including "Ultra low", but it doesn't make much of a difference as even at the lowest setting it's still too bright. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't sitting in the bottom right corner of your eye when you look at the display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up using this systemd service to turn the LED off upon booting, but something as simple as this should just be a BIOS option. Not being able to turn the LED off is apparently a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't do any GPU intensive testing such as video decoding. One annoying issue is that the display has a tendency to flicker. On top of that, there's a "nice" feature where the GPU reduces the display brightness based on the contents on the screen to conserve battery. The problem is that it takes a good two seconds or so to adjust, making it obvious and jarring to look at. It's especially noticeable when switching to the workspace overview in Gnome and back, due to a large section of this overview being a dark color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature is disabled by adding &lt;code&gt;amdgpu.abmlevel=0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX&lt;/code&gt;
in &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/grubg&lt;/code&gt;, followed by running &lt;code&gt;sudo grub2-mkconfig -o
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; and a reboot. This also seems to reduce the amount of
flickering, though it still happened a few times after applying this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some additional details on the ambient dimming anti-feature are in this forum post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can see the value of this feature but only if the GPU waits longer before adjusting the brightness and increases the transition time so it's less obvious. In it's current form it's just a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU is fine, though I didn't extensively test its performance. It's certainly better than the mediocre Intel CPU of my X1 Carbon. One thing I noticed is that the CPU makes a sort of coil whine/crackling BZZZZZZ noise when under load. This isn't unique to Framework (e.g. my X1 also does this), the more open design (e.g. there's a big fan grill/mesh at the top of the keyboard) makes this more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't speak about the fan noise because I never heard them. This could either mean they are quiet enough or that I didn't stress the CPU enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Battery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't do any proper testing of battery usage, but it seems to be on par with other Linux capable laptops based on my usage thus far. This means you'll likely be looking at 6-8 hours of battery per charge for average programming usage. It seems this is the case for basically any reasonable Linux-capable laptop these days, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did notice that it drains quite a bit when suspended: when I put it to sleep the first night the battery was at 47%. When I opened the laptop again some 8 hours later the battery was at 42%. This means you're looking at about 5% of battery per average night, which isn't great. Hibernate could be an alternative but support for it on Fedora is a bit dodgy and requires some manual work I'm not interested in, so I didn't test this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;WiFi and Bluetooth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the Intel and Mediatek cards work without issue. Both achieve the same speeds on my 1 Gbps connection over a 5Ghz network (with a channel width of 80mhz): about 800-900 Mbps for uploads and somewhere between 600 and 700 Mbps for downloads. While not being able to achieve the full 1 Gbps speed over WiFi is expected, I was a bit surprised to see that uploads are in fact faster than downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tested various other devices with similar WiFi hardware and they all upload and download at about the same speeds, and all operate at slightly lower speeds (500-600 Mbps, depending on your luck).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's the network itself either: the access points are TP-Link EAP660 HDs that can handle speeds well beyond 1 Gbps. As far as I know the configuration is also sound (including the use of specific channels to reduce interference to a minimum).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, 600-700 Mbps over WiFi is more than I'll probably ever need so I didn't dive into this further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't specifically test Bluetooth but it did detect a few devices, so I'll assume this will work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keyboard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some reviews I read mentioned that the keyboard has a bit of flex to it, but I didn't notice this. The keycaps are a little mushy, which isn't too bad but not great either. The difference in key size and spacing compared to the X1 did mean I pressed the wrong key at times, but I suspect this is just a matter of adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keyboard runs QMK, albeit a rather outdated version of QMK released in 2022. I experimented with porting the code to a newer version so I could take advantage of some features that I use in my split keyboard, but couldn't get it to work. The official way to configure the keyboard is by using this VIAL web application. This application requires WebHID support which isn't implemented by Firefox, requiring me to install and use Chromium just to configure the keyboard. This isn't enough though, as on Linux you'll need to install some additional udev rules to get things working. The official rules provided by QMK didn't work, instead I used the rules from this forum reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once set up I was able to configure the keyboard such as by changing the layout from QWERTY to Colemak-DH. VIAL is pretty basic though and the interface is rather clunky, so I'm not a fan of this approach. I hope that at some point Framework will upstream their keyboard logic into the official QMK repository to make this process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trackpad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trackpad is decent, though I noticed it's overly sensitive when it comes to scrolling. For example, on various occasions I lifted my fingers off the trackpad without any swiping motion and somehow still managed to trigger a scrolling motion. The trackpad of the X1 Carbon doesn't have this problem and subsequently is easier and more pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Speakers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They're terribly. Or more precisely, they're terrible when the volume is less than 50% or so. What appears to be happening is that adjusting the volume below 50% doesn't result in it being louder but instead changes how it sounds (for a lack of a better description). At lower volumes it sounds like sound playing over a phone in speaker mode, with a sort of tin can/metallic sound to it. Once you hit 50% or so it starts to sound more like an OK set of speakers but it also becomes noticeable louder. There's a setting in the BIOS that you can set to "Linux" mode to supposedly improve the quality but it was already set to this value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While most laptop speakers aren't great (even the Dolby Atmos speakers of the X1 Carbon are mediocre), for a laptop that costs two thousand Euros the sound is disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modular ports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting feature of the Framework is that you can swap out the various ports. You want 6 USB-C ports? You can do that! What about 3 headphone jacks? Also possible! Replacing them is quite easy, though for some reason my headphone jack adapter required some additional force to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the keyboard area the design is a bit janky though, with visible lines/space between the adapters and the case, though this at least is something you won't notice unless you're explicitly looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the conclusion: is it worth buying this laptop, considering most configurations will cost you around two thousand Euros? To be honest, no, not at all. For a premium price I expect a premium laptop, but the Framework 16 feels more like a €1200-€1500 laptop at best and certainly doesn't deliver a premium experience. I understand Framework is a young company still trying to figure out a lot of things, but two thousand Euros for this kind of laptop is just absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason I've submitted a request to return the laptop. What I'll be replacing my X1 Carbon with instead I'm not entirely sure of. One option is the Framework 13 given that it solves at least some issues I have with the Framework 16 (e.g. it's bulkiness and inability to lower the brightness further), but it also seems to share many of the other issues such as poor speaker quality and (at least from hat I could find) worse heat regulation, and a (possibly) worse battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've looked at various other brands such as System76 and the many other Clevo resellers, but they all seem to suffer similar issues such as poor battery life, poor performance, difficult to maintain hardware wise, or some combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess for now the X1 Carbon will have to hold out a little longer, provided I don't throw it out of the window the next time I can't get the various dodgy keyboard keys to work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by me, proof-read by an LLM. &lt;lb/&gt;Details at end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every now and then a compiler will surprise me with a really smart trick. When I first saw this optimisation I could hardly believe it. I was looking at loop optimisation, and wrote something like this simple function that sums all the numbers up to a given value:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far so decent: GCC has done some preliminary checks, then fallen into a loop that efficiently sums numbers using &lt;code&gt;lea&lt;/code&gt; (we’ve seen this before). But taking a closer look at the loop we see something unusual:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.L3:
  lea edx, [rdx+1+rax*2]        ; result = result + 1 + x*2
  add eax, 2                    ; x += 2
  cmp edi, eax                  ; x != value
  jne .L3                       ; keep looping
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler has cleverly realised it can do two numbers1 at a time using the fact it can see we’re going to add &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt;, which is the same as adding &lt;code&gt;x*2 + 1&lt;/code&gt;. Very cunning, I think you’ll agree!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you turn the optimiser up to &lt;code&gt;-O3&lt;/code&gt; you’ll see the compiler works even harder to vectorise the loop using parallel adds. All very clever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all for GCC. Let’s see what clang does with our code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I nearly fell off my chair: there is no loop! Clang checks for positive &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, and if so it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  lea eax, [rdi - 1]        ; eax = value - 1
  lea ecx, [rdi - 2]        ; ecx = value - 2
  imul rcx, rax             ; rcx = (value - 1) * (value - 2)
  shr rcx                   ; rcx &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= 1
  lea eax, [rdi + rcx]      ; eax = value + rcx
  dec eax                   ; --eax
  ret
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was not at all obvious to me what on earth was going on here. By backing out the maths a little, this is equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;v + ((v - 1)(v - 2) / 2) - 1;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding the parentheses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;v + (vÂ² - 2v - v + 2) / 2 - 1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rearranging a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(vÂ² - 3v + 2) / 2 + (v - 1)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiplying the &lt;code&gt;(v - 1)&lt;/code&gt; by 2 / 2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(vÂ² - 3v + 2) / 2 + (2v - 2)/2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combining those and cancelling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(vÂ² - v) / 2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplifying and factoring gives us &lt;code&gt;v(v - 1) / 2&lt;/code&gt; which is the closed-form solution to the “sum of integers”! Truly amazing2 - we’ve gone from an O(n) algorithm as written, to an O(1) one!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love that despite working with compilers for more than twenty years, they can still surprise and delight me. The years of experience and work that have been poured into making compilers great is truly humbling, and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re nearly at the end of this series - there’s so much more to say but that will have to wait for another time. Tomorrow will be a little different: see you then!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some of the initial code checks for odd/even and accounts accordingly. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does the compiler emit this exact sequence and not a slightly more straightforward sequence? I think it’s partly avoiding overflow in cases where it might otherwise overflow and just a side effect of the way clang tracks and infers induction variables. I really don’t know for sure, though. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My 2026 Open Social Web Predictions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just finished reviewing my 2025 predictions (how do you think I did grading myself?) www.timothychambers.net/2024/12/2…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to make some bets for 2026. I do this not to prove how great my prognostication muscles are, but to shine a spotlight on trends I think are vital, spur discussions, and give some attention to projects that have earned it. As always, I try to make these as quantifiable, verifiable and crisp as I can. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🌱 MILD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safe bets — would be surprising if these DON’T happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Bluesky will cross 60 million registered users in 2026. Growth will slow from 2024’s explosive pace but remain steady, driven by continued X dissatisfaction and improved features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ The ActivityPub Fediverse (excluding Threads) will cross 15 million registered users, monthly active users (excluding will plateau around 2-3 million. Another good year in terms of stable base, but no big waves of new users. Both Bluesky and Fediverse growth won’t come from big waves of migration this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Any smaller waves from X/Twitter or from a newly bought TikTok will benefit Meta (Threads/IG), BlueSky, and Fediverse in that order. I see nothing that would change that prediction that was true last year, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Threads will pass 500 million monthly active users and remain the largest ActivityPub-adjacent platform by a wide margin. But see the next prediction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Threads federation will remain partial, and opt-in through all of 2026. Full two-way federation will NOT ship in 2026 but may move from about 90 percent there, to 95 percent done, inching forward but not finalized and prioritized as a feature. As Manton wrote, that’s better than fully closed, and better than them stripping it out. (which they might do but I’m predicting not) My bet: the status quo continues. www.manton.org/2025/12/1…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Ghost’s ActivityPub integration will bring 75,000+ new federated accounts to the Fediverse and Ghost will finish 2026 in the top 10 Fediverse server software by MAU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ WordPress-based federated accounts will cross 50,000 as measured by FediDB. Currently at approximately 26,000 accounts across 12,700 servers, the WordPress-to-Fediverse pipeline becomes a meaningful growth contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🔥 MEDIUM-SPICEY Plausible bets — could go either way, but evidence points toward yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ BridgyFed will shift to “opt-out” for Bluesky users bridging to ActivityPub — and the discourse will be far less contentious than the 2024 debates predicted. Cross-protocol interoperability quietly normalizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ At least one fully independent ATProto stack — PDS, Relay, and AppView operating without dependency on Bluesky PBC infrastructure — will achieve viability in 2026, meaning it has paying customers or sustainable funding. This will be the year ATProto proves (or fails to prove) it can exist beyond Bluesky-the-company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Mastodon gGmbH will hit key sustainability milestones in 2026. Their hosting revenue model will exceed internal targets, the new organizational structure will unlock additional grant funding (beyond NGI/NLnet), and the pace of Mastodon development will noticeably accelerate — shipping more significant features in 2026 than in the previous two years combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Bluesky PBC will raise another round of funding in 2026 and announce more details on a proposed business model. Following their $15M Series A (October 2024), the company will close a larger round to extend runway. The announced business model will NOT be advertising-based. I’d expect subscriptions, marketplace fees, or enterprise services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ The first “ATProto-native” social app that is NOT microblogging will cross 100,000 users. Whether it’s Frontpage (link aggregation), Leaflet (long-form), Smoke Signal, or something new — the ATmosphere diversifies beyond Bluesky-the-app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Flipboard’s Surf app will launch its 1.0 version in 2026 and cross 1 million downloads across iOS and Android by year end, with 100,000+ monthly active users. It will become the most-downloaded dedicated Open Social Web client, surpassing Mastodon’s official app and Graysky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Fedify will power the federation layer for at least one mid-sized social platform (500K+ users) that adds ActivityPub support in 2026. The “build vs. buy” calculation for federation shifts decisively toward “just use Fedify.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Fediscovery will ship in a stable Mastodon release in 2026, moving from behind feature flags to production-ready. The specifications for pluggable discovery providers — covering account search, follow recommendations, and trends — will reach 1.0 status, and at least one public Fediscovery-compatible provider will launch for general use. Small instance operators will finally have a real option to improve discovery without running their own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ The new “ActivityRank” algorithm in Loops will prove that ethical recommendations and decentralization can coexist. Dan Supernault’s approach — where each instance trains its own algorithm while surfacing content across the ActivityPub network — will be recognized as a breakthrough in solving the fediverse’s discoverability problem. By the end of 2026, the pattern will be studied or adopted by at least two other ActivityPub platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ ATProto will advance from Internet Drafts to an official IETF Working Group in 2026. Following the September 2025 submission of initial specifications, Bluesky will secure enough support and independent implementers to form a dedicated Working Group — moving from “proposal being discussed” to “standard being formally developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🌶️ SPICY Hot takes - a bit more risky - but I’m calling my shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ A well-known digital-native media publication (10M+ monthly visitors) will federate via ActivityPub in 2026 and publicly share positive results. Whether through Ghost, WordPress, or custom implementation, this outlet will report that federated followers drove meaningful engagement — making the business case for federation legible to other publishers for the first time. By year end, at least two additional publications will announce federation plans, citing this pioneer as proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ At least one major news organization (top 50 US by traffic) will announce it is leaving X/Twitter entirely and making Bluesky or the Fediverse its primary social distribution channel. The “institutional exodus” begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ At least one major national government or major city will launch an official presence on BOTH Bluesky AND the ActivityPub Fediverse in 2026 — and it will be a European government. Expect surprising additional early adopters after this from Latin America, Asia-Pacific, or Africa to follow that lead and make moves that year to do the same. This is the year the move to “digital sovereignty" from US tech will benefit the open social web. Eurosky will inch along with some promise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Nostr ↔ ATProto ↔ ActivityPub three-way bridging becomes functional via BridgyFed or another service by end of 2026. The “protocol wars” narrative collapses into “just pick your client.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ AltStore will be live with Federation features in at least 5 countries by end of 2026 (currently EU + Japan, with Brazil, Australia, UK announced). AltStore is an independent iOS app marketplace created by Riley Testut and Shane Gill — the first major alternative to Apple’s App Store, made possible by the EU’s Digital Markets Act. The federated app marketplace model will prove viable outside Europe, challenging Apple’s App Store dominance in multiple regulatory regimes simultaneously. Their ActivityPub integration — where app updates flow to Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky — will become the most compelling non-social-media use case for decentrlized social features, proving definitively that such protocols extends beyond microblogging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ Loops will become the third most-used Fediverse software by MAU by end of 2026, trailing only Mastodon and Pixelfed. The short-form video platform will cross 100,000 monthly active users, with Loops-originated content generating significant federated engagement from non-Loops clients — proving that ActivityPub can power video-centric social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ PieFed will emerge as the most feature-rich Threadiverse platform by end of 2026, surpassing Lemmy and Mbin in moderation tools, user experience, and federation capabilities. The platform will cross 10,000 monthly active users and its rapid development pace — shipping major features weekly — will make it the default recommendation for anyone starting a new Reddit-style community in the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ More laws akin to Utah’s Digital Choice Act will pass or advance - sparking first steps towards interoperability to mainstream US discourse. The Utah law takes effect July 1, 2026, and several other states will pass similar ones, requiring social media platforms to enable data portability and interoperability. At least one major platform will announce ActivityPub or AT Protocol support to comply. The “Digital Choice” framing will prove more politically viable than “antitrust” for breaking Big Tech’s lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What did I miss? What did I get wrong? Let me know — and I’ll see you in December 2026 to grade these.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A local-first, reversible PII scrubber for AI workflows using ONNX and Regex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Privacy-Translation Paradox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every engineering team eventually faces the same dilemma: You need to translate user content (support tickets, documents, chat logs) using high-quality engines like DeepL or LLMs like GPT-4, but you strictly cannot send Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to third-party APIs (yes, I’m European).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is seemingly simple: Redact the data. The problem? Redaction destroys translation quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you scrub “John bought a generic gift for Mary” into “PERSON bought a generic gift for PERSON,” the translation engine loses the context needed for grammatical gender agreement, case endings, and prepositions in target languages like French or German. Furthermore, most open-source PII scrubbers are “one-way” — they clean data for analytics, not for a round-trip translation workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ELAN Languages, I built a solution for this. Today, we are open-sourcing Bridge Anonymization: a TypeScript library for reversible, context-aware PII masking designed specifically for translation pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How &lt;code&gt;bridge-anonymization &lt;/code&gt;Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike general-purpose scrubbers, Bridge is designed around a lifecycle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Detect -&amp;gt; Mask -&amp;gt; Translate -&amp;gt; Rehydrate&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It (Mask &amp;amp; Rehydrate, not Translate) runs entirely on-device (Node.js or Bun) using a hybrid engine of RegEx and quantized ONNX models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Hybrid Detection Strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single detection method isn’t enough. Regex is fast but limited; NER (Named Entity Recognition) is smart but heavy. &lt;code&gt;bridge-anonymization&lt;/code&gt; uses both:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Structured PII (Regex): We use strict patterns for things that follow rules — IBANs (with Mod-97 checksum validation), Credit Cards (Luhn algorithm), and Emails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Soft PII (NER): For Names, Organizations, and Locations, we wrap a powerful NER model via ONNX Runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows developers to choose their trade-off. You can run &lt;code&gt;anonymizeRegexOnly()&lt;/code&gt; for sub-millisecond performance on streams, or the full &lt;code&gt;anonymize()&lt;/code&gt; pipeline for high-precision document scrubbing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { createAnonymizer } from '@elanlanguages/bridge-anonymization';&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;// Auto-downloads the ~280MB quantized model on first run&lt;lb/&gt;const anonymizer = createAnonymizer({&lt;lb/&gt;  ner: { mode: 'quantized' }&lt;lb/&gt;});&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;await anonymizer.initialize();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. The Semantic Masking Challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While preventing leaks is solved, preserving context remains the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our current roadmap, we are tackling Semantic Masking. The goal is to enrich our PII tags with metadata (Gender, Location Scope) so the machine translation engine can generate grammatically correct output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gender Agreement: Replacing “Mary” with generic XML leads to “Il a vu &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PII type=”PERSON” /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;” (masculine default) instead of “Elle a vu…” (feminine).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prepositions: Replacing “Berlin” vs. “Germany” with generic &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PII type="LOCATION"/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;confuses engines that need to know if the location is a city, country, landmark or other place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our V1 Approach: Lookup Tables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our first iteration, we are implementing a ‘lightweight’ semantic enricher that runs post-NER detection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Before&lt;lb/&gt;&amp;lt;PII type="PERSON" id="1"/&amp;gt;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;// After (Enriched)&lt;lb/&gt;&amp;lt;PII type="PERSON" gender="female" id="1"/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Implementation:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Sources: We aggregate open data from &lt;code&gt;gender-guesser&lt;/code&gt; (approx. 40k Western names) and &lt;code&gt;GeoNames&lt;/code&gt; (cities &amp;gt;15k population).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persons: We check the first name against our database. If ambiguous (e.g., “Andrea” is male in Italian but female in German), we can use the &lt;code&gt;locale&lt;/code&gt; hint provided to the anonymizer to disambiguate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locations: We classify entities into &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;country&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; based on the GeoNames export.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is a trade-off: We explicitly chose lookup tables over ML for Version 1 to keep the library as lightweight as possible. While a model would handle edge cases better, carrying a static JSON/TXT files is significantly cheaper than loading another 100MB ONNX model just for gender inference. This covers ~90% of common Western names and major cities with near-zero runtime overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the future, we’ll put additional research into custom ML solutions to cover a broader (and context-aware) enrichment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Fuzzy Rehydration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you send a string like &lt;code&gt;Hello &amp;lt;PII id="1"/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to a generic LLM or MT engine, the output often comes back "mangled." The engine might change the quotes to smart quotes, add spaces inside the tags, or reorder attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your library relies on strict string replacement, your pipeline breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We implemented a Fuzzy Tag Matcher that is resilient to these hallucinations. It detects variations in spacing, quoting, and attribute order to ensure we can always map the token back to the original value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// The mapping table is encrypted using AES-256-GCM&lt;lb/&gt;const { anonymizedText, piiMap } = await anonymizer.anonymize("Call John at +49...");&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;// Translate via any external API...&lt;lb/&gt;const translated = await externalTranslate(anonymizedText);&lt;lb/&gt;// Even if the API returns: "Rufen Sie &amp;lt; PII id = «1» type='PERSON' &amp;gt; an..."&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;// Rehydrate seamlessly&lt;lb/&gt;const final = rehydrate(translated, piiMap); &lt;lb/&gt;// Result: "Rufen Sie John an..."&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Security First&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the “PII Map” (the link between &lt;code&gt;ID:1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;John Smith&lt;/code&gt;) effectively is the PII, we treat it as sensitive material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library includes a crypto module that forces AES-256-GCM encryption for the mapping table. The raw PII never leaves the local memory space, and the state object that persists between the masking and rehydration steps is encrypted at rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built this for Node.js environments for easy use in web-based applications (electron, tauri) and where Python isn’t always an option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Runtime: We abstract the ONNX runtime to support both &lt;code&gt;onnxruntime-node&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;onnxruntime-web&lt;/code&gt;(for Bun/Edge support).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Quantization: By default, we pull a quantized (INT8) version of the XLM-RoBERTa model (~280MB) which provides 95%+ of the accuracy of the full model at 1/4 the size (custom models are supported, too).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try it out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project is MIT licensed and available on npm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GitHub: github.com/elanlanguages/bridge-anonymization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NPM: &lt;code&gt;npm install @elanlanguages/bridge-anonymization&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d love feedback on the NER implementation and edge cases in the rehydration logic!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Browser automation without the drama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibium is browser automation infrastructure built for AI agents. A single binary handles browser lifecycle, WebDriver BiDi protocol, and exposes an MCP server — so Claude Code (or any MCP client) can drive a browser with zero setup. Works great for AI agents, test automation, and anything else that needs a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single Go binary (~10MB) that does everything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser Management: Detects/launches Chrome with BiDi enabled&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BiDi Proxy: WebSocket server that routes commands to browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP Server: stdio interface for LLM agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-Wait: Polls for elements before interacting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Screenshots: Viewport capture as PNG&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design goal: The binary is invisible. JS developers just &lt;code&gt;npm install vibium&lt;/code&gt; and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Option 1: require (REPL-friendly)
const { browserSync } = require('vibium')

// Option 2: dynamic import (REPL with --experimental-repl-await)
const { browser } = await import('vibium')

// Option 3: static import (in .mjs or .ts files)
import { browser, browserSync } from 'vibium'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sync API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const fs = require('fs')
const { browserSync } = require('vibium')

const vibe = browserSync.launch()
vibe.go('https://example.com')

const png = vibe.screenshot()
fs.writeFileSync('screenshot.png', png)

const link = vibe.find('a')
link.click()
vibe.quit()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Async API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const fs = await import('fs/promises')
const { browser } = await import('vibium')

const vibe = await browser.launch()
await vibe.go('https://example.com')

const png = await vibe.screenshot()
await fs.writeFile('screenshot.png', png)

const link = await vibe.find('a')
await link.click()
await vibe.quit()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One command to add browser control to Claude Code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;claude mcp add vibium -- npx -y vibium&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. No manual steps needed. Chrome downloads automatically during setup.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_navigate&lt;/code&gt;

          &lt;code&gt;browser_find&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Find element by CSS selector&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Click an element&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_screenshot&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Capture viewport (base64 or save to file with &lt;code&gt;--screenshot-dir&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;browser_quit&lt;/code&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 1, 1862, two Federal divisions duked it out with a Confederate corps in a cornfield fifteen miles west of Washington, D.C. The Battle of Ox Hill, or Chantilly as the Southerners called it, is a true piece of Civil War esoterica.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strobes of lightning and gusts of wind from a powerful late summer storm set the stage for brief, fierce fighting that claimed 2,100 casualties. A grizzly butcherâs bill by 21st century standards, the blood spilled at Ox Hill barely registered against the cumulative gore of the American Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Battle of Ox Hillâs relative unimportance is a product of its timing. The fight occurred two days after Second Manassas and two weeks before Antietam. A capstone to one campaign and the inauguration of another, Ox Hill has become a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its insignificance came to the forefront in the late-20th century when a development-minded Board of Supervisors in Fairfax County, Virginia determined that the battlefieldâs highest and best use was as a suburban development. A shopping center and a housing development subsumed the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today you can catch a movie or grab a kebab on hallowed ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Southern defeat in the War of the Rebellion was a group effort born of complex circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the events of July 1863âthe so-called âHigh Water Mark of the Confederacyâ along the Emmitsburg Road at Gettysburg and the capitulation at Vicksburg one day laterâare regarded as the moment when the Yankees seized momentum that carried into eventual victory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This conclusion is not definitive. More novel interpretations abound. Confederate partisan John Singleton Mosby even went so far as to suggest that the Southern cause was lost as early as July of 1861 when the Rebel army failed to capitalize on the Yankee route at First Manassas.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A less extreme and more seductive position beyond the Gettysburg/Vicksburg narrative holds that the Battle of Antietam in September of 1862 was the moment when the reality of a potential Southern victory evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Savage fighting in early 1862 brought the Yankee Army of the Potomac to the gates of Richmond where a fortuitous change of command found an ascendant Robert E. Lee at the helm of a potent Confederate army. Lee routed a numerically superior Union army, forcing it out of southeastern Virginia before pivoting to central Virginia where elements of his command savaged another Yankee host under John Pope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not content to rest on his laurels, Lee unleashed Stonewall Jackson, whose corps quickly flanked and destabilized the Yankee army setting up a colossal brawl on the plains of Manassas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confederates seized the initiative at a shining moment when European powers were deliberating formal recognition of the Rebel government.2 Southern authorities reasoned that an all-out victory over the premiere Union army in the east would occasion acknowledgement of the Confederacy, legitimization of secession, and the establishment of a southern nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closer to home, hard combat over fourteen months was beginning to reveal the limitations of men and material on the Southern side of the conflict. Never again would the Confederate Army possess the caliber of resources it did in late-1862.3 More importantly, the proverbial gloves were poised to come off the conflict. A limited, quasi-romantic war was soon to slip into a total war of attrition the South could not win.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the South was ever to win its independence, the decisive window of early September 1862 would have been the likely time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that didnât happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, Leeâs Army of Northern Virginia barely managed to stave off destruction on the banks of Antietam Creek. The âflower of the ANVâ won a tactical draw, but Leeâs retreat across the Potomac conceded a strategic defeat. This reverse gave Abraham Lincoln enough political capital to issue an Emancipation Proclamation that forever changed the spiritual calculus of the war and doomed prospects of European recognition for the Confederacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In retrospect, Lee was lucky to have coaxed this meager bounty out of his Maryland expedition. Shortly after crossing over the Potomac from Virginia, Yankee enlisted men discovered the famous âlost order,â a document from Leeâs own headquarters detailing troop movements. Once in Federal hands, this intelligence drew momentum away from Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So too, the tricky geography of western Maryland forced Lee to divide his army and reduce two potent eyes â Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia â in his rear. As if these disadvantages werenât enough, Leeâs vaunted army melted away in the interval between 2nd Manassas and Antietam. Whether by exhaustion or a moral compunction resulting from the invasion of the North, 45% of Leeâs effectives disappeared before the Army made its stand at Antietam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had the deciding battle of the Civil War been fought sooner and in the State of Virginia where Lee retained an advantage, the outcome may have been different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What follows is bad history, contingent history, the yield of fanciful âwhat ifâs.â These speculations are laden with possibilities that provide interesting insights to the affective core of Americaâs favorite bloodbath running beneath settled history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the night of August 31, 1862, a quixotic episode occurred not far from what on the next day would become the Ox Hill Battlefield. A man imbued with extraordinary power wielded it in a curious way with disastrous results. In doing so, a window of opportunity, however slight, slammed shut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deciding factor in the early evening of that balmy August night in 1862 was a man whose name remains above reproachâJEB Stuart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A golden idol in the Lost Cause pantheon, JEBâs tenure at the helm of the Confederate cavalry in the east cemented his legacy as an icon of the Old South.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dashing, romantic, chivalric, brave, unyielding, tempestuousâhe was the idealized South personified. Stuart seized the position atop the Rebel cavalry in 1861 and shaped it in his image and likeness during the dogfights of early 1862. Throughout that violent and eventful year, Stuart secured his position with a bold ride around the entire Yankee army.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning on August 10, Stuart and his mounted Rebels were in the vanguard for Stonewall Jackson during the fight at Cedar Mountain and the subsequent sprint northwards that yielded the battle of Second Manassas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fight that took place over three days on parts of the old Manassas Battlefield far eclipsed the carnage of July 1861. Two powerful and seasoned armies belted one another with a new savagery. On August 30, 1862, Federal field commander John Pope shifted his forces for a renewed assault on Confederate lines, unknowingly exposing his flank. The subsequent attack by Confederate Major General James Longstreet shattered the Federal Army and left its commander in a stupor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Good!"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renowned Confederate cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss mapped the movements of Jackson's 2nd Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia from August 26 to September 1, 1862.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having successfully flanked John Pope's Union Army, Stonewall Jackson's Corps descends on the vital Yankee supply depot at Manassas Junction. This move destabilizes the Federal Army's position in Central Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jackson's Corps holed up in a railroad cut north of the Warrenton Turnpike, just west of the hill where Jackson earned the nom de guerre "Stonewall" thirteen months prior.&lt;lb/&gt;The Federals could not find Jackson until the 28th when the sight of a Union column on the Warrenton Pike tempted Old Jack. When Jackson advanced his beloved Stonewall Brigade out of the woods to gobble up John Gibbon's freshly minted brigade of western Yankees at Brawner's Farm, few could have predicted that the two most famous brigades of the war were about to slog it out.&lt;lb/&gt;By battle's end, the Yankees knew well where Jackson's Confederates were and John Gibbon's nameless brigade was known better as the "Iron Brigade."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having successfully drawn the Federal Army out of central Virginia, Jackson drew the Yankees into a fight on ground of his choosing on a brutal slope crested by a railroad cut. &lt;lb/&gt;Union soldiers fought valiantly on August 29 and 30 against both veteran Confederate infantry and the ineptitude of Yankee high command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the shattered Yankee army regrouped at Centreville, Lee issued orders for Jackson and his 2nd Corps (with JEB Stuart's cavalry out front) to march north across Sudley Springs to the Little River Turnpike. There, the Second Corps turned east towards Jermantown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fight at Chantilly (or Ox Hill) on September 1, 1862 was not the engagement Lee or Jackson had hoped for. Instead, the minor battle was an inconclusive dust-up that both exhausted armies used to shore up their positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Yankees retreated over Bull Run and along the Warrenton Pike four miles, where they encamped around the fortified hilltop town of Centreville, Virginia. There they holed up to reorganize and block the advancing Confederate Army so that long wagon trains of wounded men and supplies could lace eastwards eighteen miles over the Braddock Road and the Warrenton and Little River Turnpikes to the line of forts protecting Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five miles west of the Union Army, Robert E. Lee was not content to rest on his laurels. Meeting with his top lieutenants early on August 31, Lee ordered a miniature version of the very maneuver that had brought on the battle at Second Manassas. Sensing that John Pope and his Federal army were content to remain stationary, Lee ordered Longstreetâs Corps to press against the Yankees at Centreville while Jackson and his men slipped northwards through Sudley Springs until they hit the Little River Turnpike where they would turn east and strike towards the hamlet of Jermantown.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee could afford to be bold. His men had just crushed a far more powerful Federal Army and a relief column of 25,000 fresh men under D.H. Hill was less than a day away. When this conjunction occurred, Leeâs forces would total over 75,000 effectives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Confederate commander targeted Jermantown because of its obvious value as a strategic crossroads. Here, a mile west of Fairfax Court House, two macadamized turnpikes intersected. If Confederates could hold this intersection, the road that John Pope hoped to use as a retreat axis for his Yankee army would be severed, forcing him to leave the entrenchments at Centreville and fight the Army of Northern Virginia on ground of Leeâs choosing with near even numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As the fates would have it, the perfect terrain for a defensive battle existed just west of Jermantown. Here, a âVâ of ridges owning its existence to the collision of North America and Africa into Pangea some 250 million years prior created a commanding landform that reached from Ox Hill across the Little River Turnpike, the Warrenton Turnpike, and the Braddock Road.6 The slopes of this ridge south of Ox Hill had been converted from old growth forest into agricultural land, clearing potential fields of fire. Additional military value could be found in a stretch of the never-completed Manassas Gap Railroad, which had been cut into the earth on a line facing the Warrenton Turnpike that the Yankee army would have to attack if Rebels secured this ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No single commander bore more responsibility in this plan to trap and destroy the Federal Army than JEB Stuart. At surface, he was the perfect man to screen and scout ahead of the main body of Rebel infantry. Not only was he a seasoned commander, but he had maintained his own headquarters the previous fall along the âVâ of ridges at Camp Qui Vive two miles beneath Ox Hill between the Little River and Warrenton Turnpikes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With his combination of soldierly acumen and knowledge of local roads, JEBâs role was to feel out the Federal post at Jermantown without revealing himself, and then report these dispositions so that Stonewall Jacksonâs infantry could carry the position early on September 1, 1862.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What JEB did instead melted any hope of destroying the Federal Army.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Riding in advance of the Confederate flanking force, JEB Stuart got within eyeshot of Jermantown just before sunset on August 31, 1862. There he found six companies of the 2nd New Jersey Infantry fanned out in advance of Jermantown on the rightward leg of the âVâ ridge.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Yankee hold over this position was tenuous at best. Despite good terrain, their numbers were low and a viable flanking routeâthe Ox Roadâtraced an unseen valley beyond the Federal flank on a line between Ox Hill to the west and the Confederate objective at Jermantown. JEB knew about this road from his previous forays in the area. In fact, on the following day, September 1, 1862, JEB guided his command down this very same road he could have used the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of utilizing this terrain asset to maintain operational security, JEB did something quite different. In his own words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âA position was gained, by a difficult road, commanding this road, which was completely occupied by the enemy with a continuous roll of wagons going toward Fairfax Courthouse. It was discovered also that we were in sight of the sentinels of a camp, the dimensions of which could not be seen. The artillery was placed in position just after dark, and opened upon the road. A few rounds sufficed to throw everything into confusion; and such commotion, upsetting, collisions and smashups were rarely ever seen. The firing continued as long as it seemed desirable, and the pieces and the command withdrew to came for the nightâ¦â 8&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Civil War-era maps lack the rich contextual details of later cartography, such as this 1915-vintage topographic map of Fairfax County, Virginia. Produced before the broadscale development and requisite earthmoving of the late-20th century, the contours presented here represent some of the best tools for understanding the minutiae of August 31, 1862.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than stay invisible and work to develop a surprise attack, Stuart ordered up the Washington Artillery, who proceeded to lob six shells at a Federal wagon train on the Warrenton Turnpike and pickets along Difficult Run. Eliciting a quick panic, JEB and his guns fled into the night. What followed was a cascade of Union dispatch writing, which caused immense alarm within the Federal command. Any decisive battle along the Little River Turnpike was averted when the intersection at Jermantown was reinforced heavily and bluecoat infantry was tasked with sweeping up towards the raiding Confederate column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JEB Stuart remained blissfully unaware of these developments. He was busy. Rather than stay out front and scout through the night, JEB and company chose to partake in what may be the corniest episode in the entire Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On that fateful evening, Stuart did not report directly to Stonewall Jackson, whom he was nominally supporting. Rather, Stuart and his staff rode in the opposite direction of the Yankee army to a place called Frying Pan where Laura Ratcliffe lived. Though married to another, Stuart had developed an infatuation for Ratcliffe and her cousin, Antonia Ford. JEB went so far as to carry a lock of Ratcliffeâs hair in his hatband.9&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heros Von Borcke, a Prussian soldier on Stuartâs staff, penned the definitive account of Stuartâs impulsive encounter with Ratcliffe on the night of August 31 and into the morning of September 1, 1862.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âA brisk canter through the dark woods brought us about midnight to the mansion, where all were fast asleep except two ferocious dogs that tried unsuccessfully to resist our entrance to the immediate grounds. Stuart proposed that we should arouse the slumbering inhabitants with the dulcet-notes of a serenade; and the serenade was attempted; but the discordant voices that joined in the effort sounded so very like the voices of the wild Indians in their war-whoopâ¦in a few minutes the whole household, young and old, were aroused, and we remained talking with our kind friends, until the morning sun, stealing through the curtains of the drawing-room, reminded us that it was time to be off. And so, after a hasty but hearty breakfast, we took leave of the hospitable family and rode back to our command.â10&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was not JEBâs only dalliance in what moderns might characterize as emotional infidelity. He doted on many attractive young women, wore their kisses gleefully, exchanged letters, and gave them gifts. This continued even after his wife, on hearing about these relationships through the grapevine, demanded an explanation from her husband.11&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Civil War historiography has a way of ensnaring its students in a world view governed by rationality. It is convenient to attribute maneuvers and battles as the fruit of well-kept plans steeped in strategic reason. The truth is more unwieldy. The lived war was a disorienting tangle of feelings and instincts, as irrational and chaotic as the men who fought it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An invisible network of turnpikes and crossroads mapped with the desires and biases of the warâs generals mirrored the concrete objectives apparent on war-era cartography. These unconscious landscapes are as important in unlocking the warâs totality as any well-trod battlefield or monument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JEB Stuartâs Civil War is fundamentally misunderstood when rendered as a collection of seductively simple rectangles hovering on Virginiaâs pastoral landscape. These graphics deny a larger truth: the Confederate cavalry chief was subject to the gravity of primal desires as much as any order from a commanding officer. His mission as a scout and buffer for the Army of Northern Virginia was complicated by an internal prerogative to identify and capture spaces where the opportunity for dopamine production was highest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of what made JEB greatâhis willingness to take extreme risks to elicit the maximum reaction from his adversariesâechoes in the structure of his particular addiction. Stuart, a teetotaler, potentially harbored a dependency on the chemicals that fired in his brain when he was praised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fixture of todayâs psychological vernacular, dopamine and brain chemistry were unknown factors during the Civil War. Receptor sites on the brain process lived experience into a cocktail that feeds the body dosages of pleasure. Eventually the brain prioritizes these sensations and behavior adjusts to a âreward-seekingâ paradigm. Consciously or not, the actions, however risky, that cause the brain to generate dopamine become the modus operandi of the host.12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harmless in abstract, the concrete reality of dopamine fixation is addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that Stuart may have had a genetic susceptibility to addictive behavior. JEBâs father, Archibald Stuart, was rumored to be a degenerate gambler, whose proclivity for the wager sent his family through dire financial straits.13 Addiction and its attendant pattern of receptor sites carry hereditary potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JEBâs behavior itself is more indicative of an addictive personality. Famous for his womanizing, the attentions of the fairer sex were but the tip of the iceberg when it came to JEBâs compulsive need to earn adoration. Every aspect of his life was governed by a deep hunger to win accolades and admiration from his colleagues, his superiors, and his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an intense and capable person, JEB Stuart exhibited reward-seeking behavior in ways that were drastic, even historic. His addiction to attention fueled tactical decisions. This complex had two favorite expressions: a garish predilection for dramatic acts of social grandstanding and a fervent desire to surprise the enemy with the unexpected deployment of the biggest guns in JEBâs possession.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Civil War map you haven't seen before: JEB Stuart's travels down the dopamine highway 1861-1864.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battle of Lewinsville, Sept. 11, 1861: At the risk of losing his guns, Stuart deploys his artillery at point blank range. He won the battle and praise. Others in the army began to look askance at Stuart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battle of Dranesville, Dec. 20, 1861: again victorious in a glorified skirmish, JEB kept busy socializing with a pack of well-to-do local ladies while his men finished up the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stuart's Ride Around the Federal Army, June 12-15, 1862: "Do not take risks," Robert E. Lee warned his cavalry chief before departing on a bold ride around the Federal Army. JEB then proceeded to take unimaginable risks. It was a great success! JEB got his name in all the papers and was commissioned a Major General.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evelington Heights, July 3, 1862: Stuart happens upon a large chunk of the Federal Army of the Potomac encamped beneath commanding heights without pickets or videttes to alert them of Stuart's presence. Should Stuart have a) relayed this information to Robert E Lee to set up a crushing defeat at the hands of the ANV or b) shoot artillery at the Federals and alert them to his presence? (JEB chose b.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skirmish at Jermantown, August 31, 1862: It was a very different time. Maybe JEB's choice to fire shells at an unaware enemy before disappearing to serenade his quasi-mistress in "dulcet tones" reads corny to modern Americans because of our relative distance from the 19th-century romantic movement. Or maybe it was actually one of the most consequential corny moments in American history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sabres and Roses Ball , September 8, 1862: It had been over a week since young women had last fawned over JEB Stuart. Something had to be done. JEB tasked his staff with borrowing battle flags to decorate the Shirley Female Academy for a grand ball to be held quite near the front line during an active campaign that ended poorly for the Confederate cause. If only the Yankees had attacked a little harder that night, maybe JEB would won some of the self-reference that was always in such short supply at his headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battle of South Mountain, Sept. 14, 1862: without any proof to support his hunch (and there was ample easy-to-find evidence disproving him), JEB shifted his forces from Turner's Gap to Crampton's Gap to chase a little glory. Unfortunately glory went looking for him at Turner's Gap, the place he had just left. Great job, JEB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battle of Antietam, Sept. 17, 1862: JEB kicked off the battle by directing artillery fire from Nicodemus Heights. Then, facing massed Federal guns later in the morning, JEB got the bright idea to send John Pelham's artillery forward to "stir them up." Pelham got spanked by concentrated Yankee artillery. No worries, though, JEB was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battle of Kelly's Ford, March 17, 1863: Despite commanding a competent retinue of junior officers, JEB saw fit to lead a dangerous charge himself. For once consequences for grandstanding began to filter in, albeit indirectly. John Pelham, Stuart's artillery commander and dear friend, joined a cavalry charge on a whim. The prize he won for playing this stupid game was a mortal wound from a piece of shrapnel that knocked into his head. Stuart was crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battle of Brandy Station, June 9, 1863: Amidst a mortality crisis in Stuart's immediate friend group, JEB was jonesing for a bit of the old dopamine. So he staged a parade! Two full reviews, in fact. Because Robert E. Lee couldn't make the first one. So he had guys do it all again on June 8. Well, surprise, surprise, the Yankee cavalry crossed the Rappahannock River early on June 9 and lit into JEB's cavalry. It was really quite embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeb's Ride, June 24-July 2, 1863: So embarrassing, in fact, that JEB acted like a man desperate to salvage his image at any cost. So he devised an amazing plan! With discretionary orders in hand, he would lead an undersized cavalry division around the entire Yankee Army. Just like he had in 1862. This would assure his status as the unquestioned pinnacle of Virginia's cavalier culture. Unfortunately, JEB was so fixated with this self-promotional maneuver that he lost touch with objective reality. In doing so, he lost literal touch with the army he was meant to serve and the ANV went into Gettysburg effectively blind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The night of August 31, 1862 found JEB juicing the moment of all its dopamine-rendering potentials. A largely forgotten moment in Civil War history, the bizzarro decisions Stuart made that night to the detriment of his army were predictable events in a larger campaign of self-indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year prior and eight miles distant, JEB Stuart was commanding a small Confederate contingent at a minor dust-up at Lewinsville, Virginia, when he ordered up a battery of artillery into a dangerous position. It was rash, hazardous, and glorious all at once. Though ultimately victorious, the episode earned a warning from his superiors.14&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 3, 1862, Stuart stumbled upon the bulk of a Federal army encamped in a vulnerable quilt of fields near Evelington Heights, Virginia. Had he alerted his superiors to this salient fact, JEB could have precipitated a decisive strike against the Yankee army. Instead, he called up a battery and watched it lob shells at the Yankees while savoring the resulting chaos. Of this poorly chosen bombardment, Lee himself was apparently âdeeply, bitterly disappointed.â15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weeks after the fiasco west of Fairfax Court House on August 31, Stuart was derelict in his duty to protect the roads over South Mountain that separated the main Union Army from the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Instead, he rushed southwards to be present at a place where he anticipated he could play a conspicuous role. When a courier informed JEB that Union forces were advancing against exactly the position he had abandoned, another general described Stuart as appearing âcompletely dazed.â16&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interspersed throughout these fits of tactical impulsivity are episodes of almost manic skirt-chasing. On September 8, 1862, JEB and company were too busy hosting their âSabers and Roses Ballâ at the Shirley Female Academy in Urbana, Maryland to notice an attack from Yankee cavalry. Two days later, Stuart failed to detect a similar Federal thrust because he was busy âdancing with spirited Irish girls.â17&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These lapses had consequences. As the war dragged into 1863, a mood of seriousness impacted JEBâs ability to milk pure pleasure out of his romantic war. His daughterâs death in November of 1862 inaugurated a season of sadness. In short order over two months, his best friends in the Confederate ArmyâJohn Pelham and Stonewall Jacksonâwere killed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent science confirms that dopamine-seeking behavior is a common compensatory mechanism in times of extreme grief.18 Consciously or not, JEB knew all about this phenomenon. He fell into familiar patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An attempt to earn a formal commendation from his father figure commander, Robert E. Lee, for conduct during the Battle of Chancellorsville ended in an icy rebuke of Stuartâs perceived self-service.19 Jonesing, JEB ordered a review of his cavalry for distinguished guests at Brandy Station, a move calculated to earn him accolades in the Richmond papers. The event was subject to much press, especially after a substantial Federal cavalry force surprised and roughed up their Confederate counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embarrassed and grieving, Stuart then embarked on a risky attempt to restore his high standing with an ill-considered and ultimately disastrous ride around the Federal army in June of 1863 that left the Army of Northern Virginia blind and scattered in the days leading up to Gettysburg.20&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best thing that ever happened for JEB Stuartâs enduring reputation was his death at Yellow Tavern in June of 1864. Despite his many flaws and the failures they enabled, JEBâs memory endures as a pristine paragon of supposed Southern manhood, chivalry, and glory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a living colleague, JEB was not as highly regarded by his brothers in arms in the Army of Northern Virginia. The satisfaction Stuart garnered from being the center of attention was a source of ire and mistrust in the organization he purported to serve. Even Robert E. Lee let slip later in life that some measure of responsibility for the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg fell on âStuartâs failure to carry out his instructions.â21&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cavalier was never taken to task for his misdeeds on the night of August 31, 1862. Sandwiched between monstrous battles, the event was largely forgotten. Exhausted armies were happy enough not to fight a winner-take-all contest west of Fairfax Court House. The minor battle at Ox Hill took place on September 1 and the war carried on, seemingly unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lurking beneath this footnote is a curious moment. Were it not for the chemical appetites of one of its chief adversaries, the Union could have suffered a death blow in the first days of September 1862.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that armies mirror the social systems that field them. Frederick Gutheim, chronicler of the Potomac River, ascribed the slowness of the industrialized Northâs Union Army âto its preparation, its deliberate organization, and its still-tentative procedures, its heavier supply trains, its mass.â22 By comparison, the loosely conglomerated Southern Army reflected the individualistic nature of Southern society. Its greatest triumphs were miraculous feats of human endeavor attributable to genius generals. So too, its catastrophic demise can be laid at the feet of these same menâs monumental flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The charts depicting strengths for the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac on September 2 and September 17, 1862 were produced with D3.js and Observable after much heartache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The math behind them is truly an instance of âstanding on the shoulders of giants.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early-1990s, a visionary graduate student at George Mason University, J.O. Allen, set out to excavate accurate numbers for both eastern armies before, during and after the Battle of Second Manassas in August of 1862. For a variety of reasons best articulated by Allen himself (and available to you in his 1993 thesis âThe Strength of the Union and Confederate Forces at Second Manassas,â which you can request for free from GMU) the true strength of both the ANV and AoP were deeply jacketed in subjective phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the appendix to Scott Hartwigâs To Antietam Creek, effectives and present for duty numbers first explored by Allen are balanced and weighed against one another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the events described above took place on August 31, I chose to utilize the Hartwig/Allen numbers for September 2, chiefly because they account for two consolidated armies. DH Hillâs relief column has arrived and the AoP/AoV have been statistically integrated. Both conceits simplify the calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Dare He?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This bearded gentleman in the gray ten-gallon hat is my great-great-great grandfather, Tom Lindley. Here he is celebrating Confederate Veterans Day in Snyder, Texas circa 1915. He served with Douglas Cooper until a portion of that unit cleaved off into Wellâs Texas Cavalry, with which Tom served until warâs end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, my great-great grandfather, Bray Colman Kitchen, served with the 4th Confederate/34th Tennessee in Maneyâs Brigade. He fought with Cheathamâs Division at Murfreesboroâs Slaughter Pen when he was eighteen years old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war was nothing short of a disaster for my Confederate ancestors. A long heritage of hard-scrabble existence culminated in intense post-war poverty. This seeded a culture of cruelty, illiteracy, and disregard in my family. Specifically, I link the outcome of the war and the Confederacyâs deliberate exploitation of working poor to serve the interests of its slaveholding elite with my great-grandmotherâs death from pellagra in Rising Star, Texas in 1928. I consider this event a carried over consequence of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;W.J. Cash referred to this world of repercussions as âthe frontier the Yankee made.â Iâm not sure I agree. The Confederacy made these enduring social badlands with its choices and its conduct. The echoes of this tragedy continue to reverberate in my family where the Confederate battle flag is shorthand for pain, poverty, and disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel inspired to illuminate this background because of a certain popular and hysterical response to any legitimate attempt to criticize Confederate leadership. The cult of the Lost Cause has calcified around its cherished heroes and daubed the bondo of flowery language into the gaping character flaws that marred their 19th century lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stuart especially is a third rail in Civil War historiography. Particularly in my native Virginia, where the myth of the dashing cavalier lives on with greater lucidity than the reality of his hambone existence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A culture nominally steeped in personal responsibility and the noblesse oblige of its white aristocracy somehow cannot find the marrow to criticize a profoundly unserious figure that has been enlisted as a load-bearing column in the structure of its historical gaslighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the occamâs razor of Lost Cause thinking, it is easier to blame the warâs outcome on a sinister cabal of northern industrialists enlisting Teutonic and Hibernian immigrant hordes to overrun the Anglo-Saxon South than it is to acknowledge that the flower of the Anglo-Saxon South made bad decisions at critical moments that cost them the war.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please allow me to propose an alternative, one dressed in the homespun of time-beloved Confederate heritage. When you find the courage to criticize JEB Stuart and question his role as a demi-God of the Confederacy, you stand with the likes of Sandie Pendleton, William Palmer, Henry Kyd Douglas, Lafayette McLaws, Henry Heth, Moxley Sorrel, Tom Rosser, Charles Marshall, and, of course, Grumble Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is my great delight to bring this alternative to the forefront. The inability to criticize its supposed heroes and the tendency to ostracize those who do so is a salient feature of Southern society. One that manifests as an inability to engage in reasonable self-criticism and to misinterpret any call for accountability as an attack. This perplexing unwillingness to acknowledge fault has had murderous consequences on southern consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So who am I to judge JEB?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that spirit, let me offer that I, too, am vain and have sought pleasure at the cost of my highest responsibilities. I, too, have simped. I have thought with my dick on more than one occasion. I have never been under concentrated enemy fire, nor have I led others in combat. I was not there that day in August of 1862 and that detachment means I can never understand how exhausted these men were in the moment. I relate to JEB and the Confederacy in that the hardest fight I ever fought, the one I really wanted to win, left me in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be easier to write me off as a guttersnipe or a dilettante or a loser and much more difficult to recognize that I have every right to ask these questions of JEB Stuart, because I am a child of the world his decisions helped bring into being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you, a true Southerner, are reading this and chomping at the bit to point out how little I have accomplished with my life and thus how I have not earned the right to offer criticism of a man who died a legend, please take a step back, look yourself in the mirror and ask aloud, âDo I deserve to criticize James Longstreet?â Funny how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps your interpretation of Confederate heritage is not the same as mine. Thatâs fine. The world is wide and it takes all types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have spent an exhausting amount of my life engrossed in a historical event we all find fascinating. I get no satisfaction from approaching the Civil War as a once-upon-a-time diorama that lives in an eternal static moment of pristine romanticism. The war I love is ugly and ongoing. It is dynamic and chaotic. It was, and remains, devastating. I am keenly aware of the ways it has molded my existence and my worldview. Maybe you are too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Living as I do in the lee of this common tragedy, I refuse to believe any of it is beyond reproach. I cannot brook with the idea that constituent parts of my existence cannot be assayed and, when necessary, found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efficient memorization using the spacing effect: literature review of widespread applicability, tips on use &amp;amp; what it’s good for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is a centuries-old psychological technique for efficient memorization &amp;amp; practice of skills where instead of attempting to memorize by ‘cramming’, memorization can be done far more efficiently by instead spacing out each review, with increasing durations as one learns the item, with the scheduling done by software. Because of the greater efficiency of its slow but steady approach, spaced repetition can scale to memorizing hundreds of thousands of items (while crammed items are almost immediately forgotten) and is especially useful for foreign languages &amp;amp; medical studies.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I review what this technique is useful for, some of the large research literature on it and the testing effect (up to ~2013, primarily), the available software tools and use patterns, and miscellaneous ideas &amp;amp; observations on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most fruitful areas of computing is making up for human frailties. They do arithmetic perfectly because we can’t1. They remember terabytes because we’d forget. They make the best calendars, because they always check what there is to do today. Even if we do not remember exactly, merely remembering a reference can be just as good, like the point of reading a manual or textbook all the way through: it is not to remember everything that is in it for later but to later remember that something is in it (and skimming them, you learn the right words to search for when you actually need to know more about a particular topic).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use any number of such neuroprosthetics2, but there are always more to be discovered. They’re worth looking for because they are so valuable: a shovel is much more effective than your hand, but a power shovel is orders of magnitude better than both - even if it requires training and expertise to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Spacing Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get a good deal from rehearsal,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If it just has the proper dispersal.&lt;lb/&gt;You would just be an ass,&lt;lb/&gt;To do it en masse,&lt;lb/&gt;Your remembering would turn out much worsal.&lt;p&gt;Ulrich Neisser3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current favorite prosthesis is the class of software that exploits the spacing effect, a centuries-old observation in cognitive psychology, to achieve results in studying or memorization much better than conventional student techniques; it is, alas, obscure4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spacing effect essentially says that if you have a question (“What is the fifth letter in this random sequence you learned?”), and you can only study it, say, 5 times, then your memory of the answer (‘e’) will be strongest if you spread your 5 tries out over a long period of time - days, weeks, and months. One of the worst things you can do is blow your 5 tries within a day or two. You can think of the ‘forgetting curve’ as being like a chart of a radioactive half-life: each review bumps your memory up in strength 50% of the chart, say, but review doesn’t do much in the early days because the memory simply hasn’t decayed much! (Why does the spacing effect work, on a biological level? There are clear neurochemical differences between massed and spaced in animal models with spacing (&amp;gt;1 hour) enhancing long-term potentiation but not massed5, but the why and wherefore - that’s an open question; see the concept of memory traces or the sleep studies.) A graphical representation of the forgetting curve:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even better, it’s known that active recall is a far superior method of learning than simply passively being exposed to information.6 Spacing also scales to huge quantities of information; gambler/financier Edward O. Thorp harnessed “spaced learning” when he was a physics grad student “in order to be able to work longer and harder”7, and Roger Craig set multiple records on the quiz show Jeopardy! 2010–201114ya in part thanks to using Anki to memorize chunks of a collection of &amp;gt;200,000 past questions8; a later Jeopardy winner, Arthur Chu, also used spaced repetition9. Med school students (who have become a major demographic for SRS due to the extremely large amounts of factual material they are expected to memorize during medical school) usually have thousands of cards, especially if using pre-made decks (more feasible for medicine due to fairly standardized curriculums &amp;amp; general lack of time to make custom cards). Foreign-language learners can easily reach 10-30,000 cards; one Anki user reports a deck of &amp;gt;765k automatically-generated cards filled with Japanese audio samples from many sources (“Youtube videos, video games, TV shows, etc”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A graphic might help; imagine here one can afford to review a given piece of information a few times (one is a busy person). By looking at the odds we can remember the item, we can see that cramming wins in the short term, but unexercised memories decay so fast that after not too long spacing is much superior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s more dramatic if we look at a video visualizing decay of a corpus of memory with random review vs most-recent review vs spaced review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;If You’re so Good, Why Aren’t You Rich&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most people find the concept of programming obvious, but the doing impossible.10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the latter strategy (cramming) is precisely what students do. They cram the night before the test, and a month later can’t remember anything. So why do people do it? (I’m not innocent myself.) Why is spaced repetition so dreadfully unpopular, even among the people who try it once?11&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it does work. Sort of. Cramming is a trade-off: you trade a strong memory now for weak memory later. (Very weak12.) And tests are usually of all the new material, with occasional old questions, so this strategy pays off! That’s the damnable thing about it - its memory longevity &amp;amp; quality are, in sum, less than that of spaced repetition, but cramming delivers its goods now13. So cramming is a rational, if short-sighted, response, and even SRS software recognize its utility &amp;amp; support it to some degree14. (But as one might expect, if the testing is continuous and incremental, then the learning tends to also be long-lived15; I do not know if this is because that kind of testing is a disguised accidental spaced repetition system, or the students/subjects simply studying/acting differently in response to small-stakes exams.) In addition to this short-term advantage, there’s an ignorance of the advantages of spacing and a subjective illusion that the gains persist1617 (cf. 201218, 2014, et al 2013, et al 2019); from 2009’s study of GRE vocab (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Across experiments, spacing was more effective than massing for 90% of the participants, yet after the first study session, 72% of the participants believed that massing had been more effective than spacing….When they do consider spacing, they often exhibit the illusion that massed study is more effective than spaced study, even when the reverse is true (Dunlosky &amp;amp; Nelson, 1994; Kornell &amp;amp; Bjork, 200817yaa; 2001; Zechmeister &amp;amp; Shaughnessy, 1980).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As one would expect if the testing and spacing effects are real things, students who naturally test themselves and study well in advance of exams tend to have higher GPAs.19 If we interpret questions as tests, we are not surprised to see that 1-on-1 tutoring works dramatically better than regular teaching and that tutored students answer orders of magnitude more questions20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This short-term perspective is not a good thing in the long term, of course. Knowledge builds on knowledge; one is not learning independent bits of trivia. Richard Hamming recalls in “You and Your Research” that “You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive….Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowledge needs to accumulate, and flashcards with spaced repetition can aid in just that accumulation, fostering steady review even as the number of cards and intellectual prerequisites mounts into the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant &amp;amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near &amp;amp; vivid. (See hyperbolic discounting.) It doesn’t help that it’s pretty difficult to figure out when one should review - the optimal point is when you’re just about to forget about it, but that’s the kicker: if you’re just about to forget about it, how are you supposed to remember to review it? You only remember to review what you remember, and what you already remember isn’t what you need to review!21&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paradox is resolved by letting a computer handle all the calculations. We can thank Hermann Ebbinghaus for investigating in such tedious detail than we can, in fact, program a computer to calculate both the forgetting curve and optimal set of reviews22. This is the insight behind spaced repetition software: ask the same question over and over, but over increasing spans of time. You start with asking it once every few days, and soon the human remembers it reasonably well. Then you expand intervals out to weeks, then months, and then years. Once the memory is formed and dispatched to long-term memory, it needs but occasional exercise to remain hale and hearty23 - I remember well the large dinosaurs made of cardboard for my 4th or 5th birthday, or the tunnel made out of boxes, even though I recollect them once or twice a year at most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Literature Review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But don’t take my word for it - Nullius in verba! We can look at the science. Of course, if you do take my word for it, you probably just want to read about how to use it and all the nifty things you can do, so I suggest you skip all the way down to that section. Everyone else, we start at the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Background: Testing Works!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“If you read a piece of text through twenty times, you will not learn it by heart so easily as if you read it ten times while attempting to recite from time to time and consulting the text when your memory fails.” –The New Organon, Francis Bacon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The testing effect is the established psychological observation that the mere act of testing someone’s memory will strengthen the memory (regardless of whether there is feedback). Since spaced repetition is just testing on particular days, we ought to establish that testing works better than regular review or study, and that it works outside of memorizing random dates in history. To cover a few papers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;1 test results in memories as strong a day later as studying 5 times; intervals improve retention compared to massed presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Karpicke &amp;amp; Roediger (200322ya). “The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In learning Swahili vocabulary, students were given varying routines of testing or studying or testing and studying; this resulted in similar scores during the learning phase. Students were asked to predict what percentage they’d remember (average: 50% over all groups). One week later, the students who tested remembered ~80% of the vocabulary versus ~35% for non-testing students. Some students were tested or studied more than others; diminishing returns set in quickly once the memory had formed the first day. Students reported rarely testing themselves and not testing already learned items.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lesson: again, testing improves memory compared to studying. Also, no student knows this.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Roediger &amp;amp; Karpicke (200619yaa). “Test-Enhanced Learning: Taking Memory Tests Improves Long-Term Retention”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Students were tested (with no feedback) on reading comprehension of a passage over 5 minutes, 2 days, and 1 week. Studying beat testing over 5 minutes, but nowhere else; students believed studying superior to testing over all intervals. At 1 week, testing scores were ~60% versus ~40%.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lesson: testing improves memory compared to studying. Everyone (teachers &amp;amp; students) ‘knows’ the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(One might be tempted to object that testing works for some learning styles, perhaps verbal styles. This is an unsupported assertion inasmuch as the experimental literature on learning styles is poor and the existing evidence mixed that there are such things as learning styles.24)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Subjects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above studies often used pairs of words or words themselves. How well does the testing effect generalize?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Materials which benefited from testing:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;foreign vocabulary (eg. 2003, et al 2009, et al 200725, de la 2012)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GRE materials (like vocab, 2009); prose passages on general scientific topics (Karpicke &amp;amp; Roediger, 200619yaa; Pashler et al, 200322ya)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;trivia (1991)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;elementary &amp;amp; middle school lessons with subjects such as biographical material and science (1917; 193926 and 201227, respectively)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;et al 2008: short-answer tests superior on textbook passages&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;history textbooks; retention better with initial short-answer test rather than multiple choice (1982)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1975 also found better retention compared to multiple-choice or recognition problems&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Duchastel &amp;amp; Nungester, 1981: 6 months after testing, testing beat studying in retention of a history passage&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1981: free recall decisively beat short-answer &amp;amp; multiple choice for reading comprehension of a history passage&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1989: free recall self-test beat recognition or Cloze deletions; subject matter was the labels for parts of flowers&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;et al 2007: prose passages; initial short answer testing produced superior results 3 days later on both multiple choice and short answer tests&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2002: tests in 2 psychology courses, introductory &amp;amp; memory/learning; “80% versus 74% for the introductory psychology course and 89% versus 80% for the learning and memory course”28&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This covers a pretty broad range of what one might call ‘declarative’ knowledge. Extending testing to other fields is more difficult and may reduce to ‘write many frequent analyses, not large ones’ or ‘do lots of small exercises’, whatever those might mean in those fields:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A third issue, which relates to the second, is whether our proposal of testing is really appropriate for courses with complex subject matters, such as the philosophy of Spinoza, Shakespeare’s comedies, or creative writing. Certainly, we agree that most forms of objective testing would be difficult in these sorts of courses, but we do believe the general philosophy of testing (broadly speaking) would hold-students should be continually engaged and challenged by the subject matter, and there should not be merely a midterm and final exam (even if they are essay exams). Students in a course on Spinoza might be assigned specific readings and thought-provoking essay questions to complete every week. This would be a transfer-appropriate form of weekly ‘testing’ (albeit with take-home exams). Continuous testing requires students to continuously engage themselves in a course; they cannot coast until near a midterm exam and a final exam and begin studying only then.29&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Downsides&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing does have some known flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;interference in recall - ability to remember tested items drives out ability to remember similar untested items&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most/all studies were in laboratory settings and found relatively small effects:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In sum, although various types of recall interference are quite real (and quite interesting) phenomena, we do not believe that they compromise the notion of test-enhanced learning. At worst, interference of this sort might dampen positive testing effects somewhat. However, the positive effects of testing are often so large that in most circumstances they will overwhelm the relatively modest interference effects.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;multiple choice tests can accidentally lead to ‘negative suggestion effects’ where having previously seen a falsehood as an item on the test makes one more likely to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is mitigated or eliminated when there’s quick feedback about the right answer (see 2008 “Feedback enhances the positive effects and reduces the negative effects of multiple-choice testing”). Solution: don’t use multiple choice; inferior in testing ability to free recall or short answers, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neither problem seems major.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Distributed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot depends on when you do all your testing. Above we saw some benefits to testing a lot the moment you learn something, but the same number of tests could be spread out over time, to give us the spacing effect or spaced repetition. There are hundreds of studies involving the spacing effect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;et al 2006 is a review of 184 articles with 317 experiments; other reviews include:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1928, “Factors influencing the relative economy of massed and distributed practice in learning”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost unanimously they find spacing out tests is superior to massed testing when the final test/measurement is conducted days or years later30, although the mechanism isn’t clear31. Besides all the previously mentioned studies, we can throw in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research literature focuses extensively on the question of what kind of spacing is best and what this implies about memory: a spacing that has static fixed intervals or a spacing which expands? This is important for understanding memory and building models of it, and would be helpful for integrating spaced repetition into classrooms (for example, 2013’s 10 minutes studying / 10 minutes break schedule, repeating the same material 3 times, designed to trigger LTM formation on that block of material?) But for practical purposes, this is uninteresting; to sum it up, there are many studies pointing each way, and whatever difference in efficiency exists, is minimal. Most existing software follows SuperMemo in using an expanding spacing algorithm, so it’s not worth worrying about; as Mnemosyne developer Peter Bienstman says, it’s not clear the more complex algorithms really help32, and the Anki developers were concerned about the complexity, difficulty of reimplementing SM’s proprietary algorithms, lack of substantial gains, &amp;amp; larger errors SM3+ risks attempting to be more optimal. So too here.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A week later, the massed reviewers went from 5.9 correct → 2.1; the spaced reviewers went from 5.5 → 5.0. (Note the usual observation: massed was initially better, and later much worse, less than half as good.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Four days after the 2 high school groups memorized 16 French words, the spaced group remembered 15 and the massed 11.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A test immediately following the training showed superior performance for the distributed group (70% correct) compared to the massed group (53% correct). These results seem to show that the spacing effect applies to school-age children and to at least some types of materials that are typically taught in school.35&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1999, “A meta-analytic review of the distribution of practice effect: Now you see it, now you don’t”:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;According to Donovan &amp;amp; Radosevich’s meta-analysis of spacing studies, the effect size for the spacing effect is d = 0.42. This means that the average person getting distributed training remembers better than about 67% of the people getting massed training. This effect size is nothing to sneeze at-in education research, effect sizes as low as d = 0.25 are considered “practically significant”, while effect sizes above d = 1 are rare.36&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In one meta-analysis by 1999, for instance, the size of the spacing effect declined sharply as conceptual difficulty of the task increased from low (eg. rotary pursuit) to average (eg. word list recall) to high (eg. puzzle). By this finding, the benefits of spaced practise may be muted for many mathematics tasks.37&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Donovan meta-analysis notes that the effect size is smaller in studies with better methodology, but still important.&lt;/p&gt;

Vol 13(2) April 198738ya, 344-349; the extremely long delay after the initial training period makes this particularly interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Harry Bahrick and Elizabeth Phelps (198738ya) examined the retention of 50 Spanish vocabulary words after an eight-year delay. Subjects were divided into three groups. Each practiced for seven or eight sessions, separated by a few minutes, a day, or 30 days. In each session, subjects practiced until they could produce the list perfectly one time….Eight years later, people in the no-delay group could recall 6% of the words, people in the one-day delay group could remember 8%, and those in the 30-day group averaged 15%. Everyone also took a multiple choice test, and again, the spacing effect was observed. The no-delay group scored 71%, the one-day group scored 80%, and the 30-day group scored 83%.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;…Bahrick and his colleagues varied both the spacing of practice and the amount of practice. Practice sessions were spaced 14, 28, or 56 days apart, and totaled 13 or 26 sessions. They tested subjects’ memory one, two, three, and five years after training. Once again, it took a bit longer to reach the criterion within each session when practice sessions were spaced farther apart, but again, this small investment paid dividends years later. It didn’t matter whether testing occurred at one, two, three, or five years after practice-the 56-day group always remembered the most, the 28-day group was next, and the 14-day group remembered the least. Further, the effect was quite large. If words were practiced every 14 days, you needed twice as much practice to reach the same level of performance as when words were practiced every 56 days!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Generality of Spacing Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have already seen that spaced repetition is effective on a variety of academic fields and mediums. Beyond that, spacing effects can be found in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;various “domains (eg. learning perceptual motor tasks or learning lists of words)”42 such as spatial43&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“across species (eg. rats, pigeons, and humans [or flies or bumblebees, and sea slugs, et al 1972 &amp;amp; et al 2002])”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“across age groups [infancy44, childhood45, adulthood46, the elderly47] and individuals with different memory impairments”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“and across retention intervals of seconds48 [to days49] to months” (we have already seen studies using years)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The domains are limited, however. et al 2006:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[1995, reviewing 120 articles] concluded that longer ISIs facilitate learning of verbal information (eg. spelling50) and motor skills (eg. mirror tracing); in each case, over 80% of studies showed a distributed practice benefit. In contrast, only one third of intellectual skill (eg. math computation) studies showed a benefit from distributed practice, and half showed no effect from distributed practice.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…[1999] The largest effect sizes were seen in low rigor studies with low complexity tasks (eg. rotary pursuit, typing, and peg reversal), and retention interval failed to influence effect size. The only interaction Donovan and Radosevich examined was the interaction of ISI and task domain. It is important to note that task domain moderated the distributed practice effect; depending on task domain and lag, an increase in ISI either increased or decreased effect size. Overall, Donovan and Radosevich found that increasingly distributed practice resulted in larger effect sizes for verbal tasks like free recall, foreign language, and verbal discrimination, but these tasks also showed an inverse-U function, such that very long lags produced smaller effect sizes. In contrast, increased lags produced smaller effect sizes for skill tasks like typing, gymnastics, and music performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills like gymnastics and music performance raise an important point about the testing effect and spaced repetition: they are for the maintenance of memories or skills, they do not increase it beyond what was already learned. If one is a gifted amateur when one starts reviewing, one remains a gifted amateur. Ericsson covers what is necessary to improve and attain new expertise: deliberate practice51. From “The Role of Deliberate Practice”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The view that merely engaging in a sufficient amount of practice—regardless of the structure of that practice—leads to maximal performance, has a long and contested history. In their classic studies of Morse Code operators, Bryan and Harter (1897, 1899) identified plateaus in skill acquisition, when for long periods subjects seemed unable to attain further improvements. However, with extended efforts, subjects could restructure their skill to overcome plateaus…Even very experienced Morse Code operators could be encouraged to dramatically increase their performance through deliberate efforts when further improvements were required…More generally, Thorndike (1921104ya) observed that adults perform at a level far from their maximal level even for tasks they frequently carry out. For instance, adults tend to write more slowly and illegibly than they are capable of doing…The most cited condition [for optimal learning and improvement of performance] concerns the subjects’ motivation to attend to the task and exert effort to improve their performance…The subjects should receive immediate informative feedback and knowledge of results of their performance…In the absence of adequate feedback, efficient learning is impossible and improvement only minimal even for highly motivated subjects. Hence mere repetition of an activity will not automatically lead to improvement in, especially, accuracy of performance…In contrast to play, deliberate practice is a highly structured activity, the explicit goal of which is to improve performance. Specific tasks are invented to overcome weaknesses, and performance is carefully monitored to provide cues for ways to improve it further. We claim that deliberate practice requires effort and is not inherently enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Motor Skills&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that reviews conflict on how much spaced repetition applies to motor skills; 1988 find benefits, while 1987 and earlier do not. The difference may be that simple motor tasks benefit from spacing as suggested by 1979 (benefits to a randomized/spaced schedule), while complex ones where the subject is already operating at his limits do not benefit, suggested by 2002. 2009 mentions some divergent studies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The contextual interference hypothesis (Shea and 1979, 1966 [“Facilitation and interference” in Acquisition of skill]) predicted the blocked condition would exhibit superior performance immediately following practice (acquisition) but the random condition would perform better at delayed retention testing. This hypothesis is generally consistent in laboratory motor learning studies (eg. 1983, 2004), but less consistent in applied studies of sports skills (with a mix of positive &amp;amp; negative eg. 1997, et al 1994, 2013) and fine-motor skills ( et al 2005, Ste- et al 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the positive spaced repetition studies (from 2012):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perhaps even prior to the empirical work on cognitive learning and the spacing effect, the benefits of spaced study had been apparent in an array of motor learning tasks, including maze learning (1912), typewriting (1915), archery (1915), and javelin throwing (1916; see 1928, for a larger review of the motor learning tasks which reap benefits from spacing; see also 1996, for a more recent review of motor learning tasks). Thus, as in the cognitive literature, the study of practice distribution in the motor domain is long established (see reviews by 1987; 2005), and most interest has centered around the impact of varying the separation of learning trials of motor skills in learning and retention of practiced skills. 1988 conducted a review and meta-analysis of studies on distribution of practice, and they concluded that massing of practice tends to depress both immediate performance and learning, where learning is evaluated at some removed time from the practice period. Their main finding was, as in the cognitive literature, that learning was relatively stronger after spaced than after massed practice (although see 1988; 1988; et al 1988 for criticisms of the review)…Probably the most widely cited example is 1978’s study concerning how optimally to teach postal workers to type. They had learners practice once a day or twice a day, and for session lengths of either 1 or 2 h at a time. The main findings were that learners took the fewest cumulative hours of practice to achieve a performance criterion in their typing when they were in the most distributed practice condition. This finding provides clear evidence for the benefits of spacing practice for enhancing learning. However, as has been pointed out (; 2005), there is also trade-off to be considered in that the total elapsed time (number of days) between the beginning of practice and reaching criterion was substantially longer for the most spaced condition….The same basic results have been repeatedly demonstrated in the decades since (see reviews by 1990; 2004), and with a wide variety of motor tasks including different badminton serves (1986), rifle shooting (Boyce &amp;amp; Del 1990), a pre-established skill, baseball batting ( et al 1994), learning different logic gate configurations ( et al 1989; 1990), for new users of automated teller machines (2000), and for solving mathematical problems as might appear in a class homework (2007; Le 2008; 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In this vein, it’s interesting to note that interleaving may be helpful for tasks with a mental component as well: et al 2003, et al 2011, and according to et al 2013 the rates at which Xbox Halo: Reach video game players advance in skill matches nicely predictions from distribution: players who play 4–8 matches a week advance more in skill per match, than players who play more (distributed); but advance slower per week than players who play many more matches / massed. (See also 2016.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Abstraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another potential objection is to argue52 that spaced repetition inherently hinders any kind of abstract learning and thought because related materials are not being shown together - allowing for comparison and inference - but days or months apart. Ernst A. Rothkopf: “Spacing is the friend of recall, but the enemy of induction” (2008, p. 585). This is plausible based on some of the early studies53 but the 4 recent studies I know of directly examining the issue both found spaced repetition helped abstraction as well as general recall:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To bring it all together with the gist:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;testing is effective and comes with minimal negative factors&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;expanding spacing is roughly as good as or better than (wide) fixed intervals, but expanding is more convenient and the default&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;testing (and hence spacing) is best on intellectual, highly factual, verbal domains, but may still work in many low-level domains&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;the research favors questions which force the user to use their memory as much as possible; in descending order of preference:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;free recall&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;short answers&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;multiple-choice&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;recognition&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;the research literature is comprehensive and most questions have been answered - somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;the most common mistakes with spaced repetition are&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;formulating poor questions and answers&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;assuming it will help you learn, as opposed to maintain and preserve what one already learned54. (It’s hard to learn from cards, but if you have learned something, it’s much easier to then devise a set of flashcards that will test your weak points.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Using It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One doesn’t need to use SuperMemo, of course; there are plenty of free alternatives. I like Mnemosyne (homepage) myself - Free, packaged for Ubuntu Linux, easy to use, free mobile client, long track record of development and reliability (I’ve used it since ~2008). But the SRS Anki is also popular, and has advantages in being more feature-rich and a larger &amp;amp; more active community (and possibly better support for East Asian language material and a better but proprietary mobile client).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, but what does one do with it? It’s a surprisingly difficult question, actually. It’s akin to “the tyranny of the blank page” (or blank wiki); now that I have all this power - a mechanical golem that will never forget and never let me forget whatever I chose to - what do I choose to remember?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Much To Add&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most difficult task, beyond that of just persisting until the benefits become clear, is deciding what’s valuable enough to add in. In a 3 year period, one can expect to spend “30–40 seconds” on any given item. The long run theoretical predictions are a little hairier. Given a single item, the formula for daily time spent on it is Time = 1⁄500 × nthYear−1.5 + 1⧸30,000. During our 20th year, we would spend t = 1⁄500 × 20−1.5 + 1⧸3,000, or &lt;code&gt;3.557e-4&lt;/code&gt; minutes a day. This is the average daily time, so to recover the annual time spent, we simply multiply by 365. Suppose we were interested in how much time a flashcard would cost us over 20 years. The average daily time changes every year (the graph looks like an exponential decay, remember), so we have to run the formula for each year and sum them all; in Haskell:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sum $ map (\year -&amp;gt; ((1/500 * year ** (-(1.5))) + 1/30000) * 365.25) [1..20]
# 1.8291&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which evaluates to 1.8 minutes. (This may seem too small, but one doesn’t spend much time in the first year and the time drops off quickly55.) Anki user muflax’s statistics put his per-card time at 71s, for example. But maybe Piotr Woźniak was being optimistic or we’re bad at writing flashcards, so we’ll double it to 5 minutes. That’s our key rule of thumb that lets us decide what to learn and what to forget: if, over your lifetime, you will spend more than 5 minutes looking something up or will lose more than 5 minutes as a result of not knowing something, then it’s worthwhile to memorize it with spaced repetition. 5 minutes is the line that divides trivia from useful data.56 (There might seem to be thousands of flashcards that meet the 5 minute rule. That’s fine. Spaced repetition can accommodate dozens of thousands of cards. See the next section.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To a lesser extent, one might wonder when one is in a hurry, should one learn something with spaced repetition and with massed? How far away should the tests or deadlines be before abandoning spaced repetition? It’s hard to compare since one would need a specific regimens to compare for the crossover point, but for massed repetition, the average time after memorization at which one has a 50% chance of remembering the memorized item seems to be 3-5 days.57 Since there would be 2 or 3 repetitions in that period, presumably one would do better than 50% in recalling an item. 5 minutes and 5 days seems like a memorable enough rule of thumb: ‘don’t use spaced repetition if you need it sooner than 5 days or it’s worth less than 5 minutes’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Overload&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is not infinite. Wozniak estimates a maximum number of ~300,000 items can be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One common experience of new users to spaced repetition is to add too much stuff—trivialities and things they don’t really care about. But they soon learn the curse of Borges’s Funes the Memorious. If they don’t actually want to learn the material they put in, they will soon stop doing the daily reviews - which will cause reviews to pile up, which will be further discouraging, and so they stop. At least with physical fitness there isn’t a precisely dismaying number indicating how far behind you are! But if you have too little at the beginning, you’ll have few repetitions per day, and you’ll see little benefit from the technique itself - it looks like boring flash card review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What to Add&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find one of the best uses for Mnemosyne is, besides the classic use of memorizing academic material such as geography or the periodic table or foreign vocabulary or Bible/Koran verses or the avalanche of medical school facts, to add in words from A Word A Day58 and Wiktionary, memorable quotes I see59, personal information such as birthdays (or license plates, a problem for me before), and so on. Quotidian uses, but all valuable to me. With a diversity of flashcards, I find my daily review interesting. I get all sorts of questions - now I’m trying to see whether a Haskell fragment is syntactically correct, now I’m pronouncing Korean hangul and listening to the answer, now I’m trying to find the Ukraine on a map, now I’m enjoying some A.E. Housman poetry, followed by a few quotes from LessWrong quote threads, and so on. Other people use it for many other things; one application that impresses me for its simple utility is memorizing names &amp;amp; faces of students although learning musical notes is also not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Workload&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On average, when I’m studying a new topic, I’ll add 3–20 questions a day. Combined with my particular memory, I usually review about 90 or 100 items a day (out of the total &amp;gt;18,300). This takes under 20 minutes, which is not too bad. (I expect the time is expanded a bit by the fact that early on, my formatting guidelines were still being developed, and I hadn’t the full panoply of categories I do now - so every so often I must stop and edit categories.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I haven’t been studying something recently, the exponential decaying of reviews slowly drops the daily review. For example, in March 201114ya, I wasn’t studying many things, so for 2011-03-24–2011-03-2614ya, my scheduled daily reviews are 73, 83, and 74; after that, it will 201213ya, the daily reviews are in the 40s or sometimes 50s for similar reasons, but the gradual shrinkage will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see this vividly, and we can even see a sort of analogue of the original forgetting curve, if we ask Mnemosyne 2.0 to graph the number of cards to review per day for the next year up to February 201312ya (assuming no additions or missed reviews etc.):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Mnemosyne weren’t using spaced repetition, it would be hard to keep up with 18,300+ flashcards. But because it is using spaced repetition, keeping up is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nor is 18.3k extraordinary. Many users have decks in the 6–7k range, Mnemosyne developer Peter Bienstman has &amp;gt;8.5k &amp;amp; Patrick Kenny &amp;gt;27k, Hugh Chen has a 73k+ deck, and in &lt;code&gt;irc://irc.libera.chat#anki&lt;/code&gt;, they tell me of one user who triggered bugs with his &amp;gt;200k deck. 200,000 may be a bit much, but for regular humans, some amount smaller seems possible—it’s interesting to compare SRS decks to the feat of memorizing Paradise Lost or to the Muslim title of ‘hafiz’, one who has memorized the ~80,000 words of the Koran, or the stricter ‘hafid’, one who had memorized the Koran and 100,000 hadiths as well. Other forms of memory are still more powerful.60 (I suspect that spaced repetition is involved in one of the few well-documented cases of “hyperthymesia”, Jill Price: reading Wired, she has ordinary fallible powers of memorization for surprise demands with no observed anatomical differences and is restricted to “her own personal history and certain categories like television and airplane crashes”; further, she is a packrat with obsessive-compulsive traits who keeps &amp;gt;50,000 pages of detailed diaries—perhaps due to a childhood trauma—associates daily events nigh-involuntarily with past events. Marcus says the other instances of hyperthymesia resemble Price.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When to Review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When should one review? In the morning? In the evening? Any old time? The studies demonstrating the spacing effect do not control or vary the time of day, so in one sense, the answer is: it doesn’t matter - if it did matter, there would be considerable variance in how effective the effect is based on when a particular study had its subjects do their reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So one reviews at whatever time is convenient. Convenience makes one more likely to stick with it, and sticking with it overpowers any temporary improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If one is not satisfied with that answer, then on general considerations, one ought to review before bedtime &amp;amp; sleep. Memory consolidation seems to be related, and sleep is known to powerfully influence what memories enter long-term memory, strengthening memories of material learned close to bedtime and increasing creativity; interrupting sleep without affecting total sleep time or quality still damages memory formation in mice61. So reviewing before bedtime would be best. (Other mental exercises show improvement when trained before bedtime; for example, dual n-back.) One possible mechanism is that it may be that the expectancy of future reviews/tests is enough to encourage memory consolidation during sleep; so if one reviews and goes to bed, presumably the expectancy is stronger than if one reviewed at breakfast and had an eventful day and forgot entirely about the reviewed flashcards. (See also the correlation between time of studying &amp;amp; GPA in 2012.) Neural growth may be related; from 2010:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology underlying normal human memory formation have revealed that learning is not an event, but rather a process that unfolds over time.16,17,18,[2003 Fundamental Neuroscience],20 Thus, it is not surprising that learning strategies that repeat materials over time enhance their retention.20,21,22,23,24,25,26&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…Thousands of new cells are generated in this region every day, although many of these cells die within weeks of their creation.31 The survival of dentate gyrus neurons has been shown to be enhanced in animals when they are placed into learning situations.16-20 Animals that learn well retain more dentate gyrus neurons than do animals that do not learn well. Furthermore, 2 weeks after testing, animals trained in discrete spaced intervals over a period of time, rather than in a single presentation or a ‘massed trial’ of the same information, remember better.16-20 The precise mechanism that links neuronal survival with learning has not yet been identified. One theory is that the hippocampal neurons that preferentially survive are the ones that are somehow activated during the learning process.16-2062 The distribution of learning over a period of time may be more effective in encouraging neuronal survival by allowing more time for changes in gene expression and protein synthesis that extend the life of neurons that are engaged in the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…Transferring memory from the encoding stage, which occurs during alert wakefulness, into consolidation must thus occur at a time when interference from ongoing new memory formation is reduced.17,18 One such time for this transfer is during sleep, especially during non-rapid eye movement sleep, when the hippocampus can communicate with other brain areas without interference from new experiences.32,33,34 Maybe that is why some decisions are better made after a good night’s rest and also why pulling an all-nighter, studying with sleep deprivation, may allow you to pass an exam an hour later but not remember the material a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Prospects: Extended Flashcards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s step back for a moment. What are all our flashcards, small and large, doing for us? Why do I have a pair of flashcards for the word ‘anent’ among many others? I can just look it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But look ups take time compared to already knowing something. (Let’s ignore the previously discussed 5 minute rule.) If we think about this abstractly in a computer science context, we might recognize it as an old concept in algorithms &amp;amp; optimization discussions—the space-time tradeoff. We trade off lookup time against limited skull space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the sort of factual data already given as examples - we might one day need to know the average annual rainfall in Honolulu or Austin, but it would require too much space to memorize such data for all capitals. There are millions of English words, but in practice any more than 100,000 is excessive. More surprising is a sort of procedural knowledge. An extreme form of space-time tradeoffs in computers is when a computation is replaced by pre-calculated constants. We could take a math function and calculate its output for each possible input. Usually such a lookup table of input to output is really large. Think about how many entries would be in such a table for all possible integer multiplications between 1 and 1 billion. But sometimes the table is really small (like binary Boolean functions) or small (like trigonometric tables) or large but still useful (rainbow tables usually start in the gigabytes and easily reach terabytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given an infinitely large lookup table, we could replace completely the skill of, say, addition or multiplication by the lookup table. No computation. The space-time tradeoff taken to the extreme of the space side of the continuum. (We could go the other way and define multiplication or addition as the slow computation which doesn’t know any specifics like the multiplication table - as if every time you wanted to add 2+2 you had to count on 4 fingers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So suppose we were children who wanted to learn multiplication. SRS and Mnemosyne can’t help because multiplication is not a specific factoid? The space-time tradeoff shows us that we can de-proceduralize multiplication and turn it partly into factoids. It wouldn’t be hard for us to write a quick script or macro to generate, say, 500 random cards which ask us to multiply AB by XY, and import them to Mnemosyne.63&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, which is your mind going to do - get good at multiplying 2 numbers (generate on-demand), or memorize 500 different multiplication problems (memoize)? From my experience with multiple subtle variants on a card, the mind gives up after just a few and falls back on a problem-solving approach - which is exactly what one wants to exercise, in this case. Congratulations; you have done the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a software engineering point of view, we might want to modify or improve the cards, and 500 snippets of text would be a tad hard to update. So coolest would be a ‘dynamic card’. Add a markup type like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;eval src=""&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; , and then Mnemosyne feeds the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; argument straight into the Python interpreter, which returns a tuple of the question text and the answer text. The question text is displayed to the user as usual, the user thinks, requests the answer, and grades himself. In Anki, Javascript is supported directly by the application in HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags (currently inline only but Anki could presumably import libraries by default), for example for kinds of syntax highlighting, so any kind of dynamic card could be written that one wants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So for multiplication, the dynamic card would get 2 random integers, print a question like &lt;code&gt;x * y = ?&lt;/code&gt; and then print the result as the answer. Every so often you would get a new multiplication question, and as you get better at multiplication, you see it less often - exactly as you should. Still in a math vein, you could generate variants on formulas or programs where one version is the correct one and the others are subtly wrong; I do this by hand with my programming flashcards (especially if I make an error doing exercises, that signals a finer point to make several flashcards on), but it can be done automatically. kpreid describes one tool of his:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have written a program (in the form of a web page) which does a specialized form of this [generating ‘damaged formulas’]. It has a set of generators of formulas and damaged formulas, and presents you with a list containing several formulas of the same type (eg. ∫ 2x dx = x^2 + C) but with one damaged (eg. ∫ 2x dx = 2x^2 + C).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This approach generalizes to anything you can generate random problems of or have large databases of examples of. Khan Academy apparently does something like this in associating large numbers of (algorithmicly-generated?) problems with each of its little modules and tracking retention of the skill in order to decide when to do further review of that module. For example, maybe you are studying Go and are interested in learning life-and-death positions. Those are things that can be generated by computer Go programs, or fetched from places like GoProblems.com. For even more examples, Go is rotationally invariant - the best move remains the same regardless of which way the board is oriented and since there is no canonical direction for the board (like in chess) a good player ought to be able to play the same no matter how the board looks - so each specific example can be mirrored in 3 other ways. Or one could test one’s ability to ‘read’ a board by writing a dynamic card which takes each example board/problem and adds some random pieces as long as some go-playing program like GNU Go says the best move hasn’t changed because of the added noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could learn an awful lot of things this way. Programming languages could be learned this way - someone learning Haskell could take all the functions listed in the Prelude or his Haskell textbook, and ask QuickCheck to generate random arguments for the functions and ask the GHC interpreter &lt;code&gt;ghci&lt;/code&gt; what the function and its arguments evaluate to. Games other than go, like chess, may work (a live example being Chess Tempo &amp;amp; Listudy, and see the experience of Dan Schmidt; or Super Smash Brothers). A fair bit of mathematics. If the dynamic card has Internet access, it can pull down fresh questions from an RSS feed or just a website; this functionality could be quite useful in a foreign language learning context with every day bringing a fresh sentence to translate or another exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With some NLP software, one could write dynamic flashcards which test all sorts of things: if one confuses verbs, the program could take a template like “$PRONOUN $VERB $PARTICLE $OBJECT % {right: caresse, wrong: caresses}” which yields flashcards like “Je caresses le chat” or “Tu caresse le chat” and one would have to decide whether it was the correct conjugation. (The dynamicism here would help prevent memorizing specific sentences rather than the underlying conjugation.) In full generality, this would probably be difficult, but simpler approaches like templates may work well enough. Jack Kinsella:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I wish there were dynamic SRS decks for language learning (or other disciplines). Such decks would count the number of times you have reviewed an instance of an underlying grammatical rule or an instance of a particular piece of vocabulary, for example its singular/plural/third person conjugation/dative form. These sophisticated decks would present users with fresh example sentences on every review, thereby preventing users from remembering specific answers and compelling them to learn the process of applying the grammatical rule afresh. Moreover, these decks would keep users entertained through novelty and would present users with tacit learning opportunities through rotating vocabulary used in non-essential parts of the example sentence. Such a system, with multiple-level review rotation, would not only prevent against overfit learning, but also increase the total amount of knowledge learned per minute, an efficiency I’d gladly invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though these things seem like ‘skills’ and not ‘data’!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;SuperMemo doesn’t fall under the same ratings, but it has sold in the hundreds of thousands over its 2 decades:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Biedalak is CEO of SuperMemo World, which sells and licenses Wozniak’s invention. Today, SuperMemo World employs just 25 people. The venture capital never came through, and the company never moved to California. About 50,000 copies of SuperMemo were sold in 200619ya, most for less than $48.99$302006. Many more are thought to have been pirated.66&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems safe to estimate the combined market-share of Anki, Mnemosyne, iSRS and other SRS apps at somewhere under 50,000 users (making due allowance for users who install multiple times, those who install and abandon it, etc.). Relatively few users seem to have migrated from SuperMemo to those newer programs, so it seems fair to simply add that 50k to the other 50k and conclude that the worldwide population is somewhere around (but probably under) 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where Was I Going With This?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nowhere, really. Mnemosyne/SR software in general are just one of my favorite tools: it’s based on a famous effect67 discovered by science, and it exploits it elegantly68 and usefully. It’s a testament to the Enlightenment ideal of improving humanity through reason and overcoming our human flaws; the idea of SR is seductive in its mathematical rigor69. In this age where so often the ideal of ‘self-improvement’ and progress are decried, and gloom are espoused by even the common people, it’s really nice to just have a small example like this in one’s daily life, an example not yet so prosaic and boring as the lightbulb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;See Also&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the course of using Mnemosyne, I’ve written a number of scripts to generate repetitively varying cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mnemo.hs&lt;/code&gt;will take any newline-delimited chunk of text, like a poem, and generates every possible Cloze deletion; that is, an ABC poem will become 3 questions: _BC/ABC, A_C/ABC, AB_/ABC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mnemo2.hs&lt;/code&gt;works as above, but is more limited and is intended for long chunks of text where&lt;code&gt;mnemo.hs&lt;/code&gt;would cause a combinatorial explosion of generated questions; it generates a subset: for ABCD, one gets __CD/ABCD, A__D/ABCD, and AB__/ABCD (it removes 2 lines, and iterates through the list).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mnemo3.hs&lt;/code&gt;is intended for date or name-based questions. It’ll take input like “Barack Obama is %47%.” and spit out some questions based on this: “Barack Obama is _7./47”, “Barack Obama is 4_./47” etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mnemo4.hs&lt;/code&gt;is intended for long lists of items. If one wants to memorize the list of US Presidents, the natural questions for flashcards goes something like “Who was the 3rd president?/Thomas Jefferson”, “Thomas Jefferson was the _rd president./3”, “Who was president after John Adams?/Thomas Jefferson”, “Who was president before James Madison?/Thomas Jefferson”.&lt;p&gt;You note there’s repetition if you do this for each president - one asks the ordinal position of the item both ways (item -&amp;gt; position, position -&amp;gt; item), what precedes it, and what succeeds it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mnemo4.hs&lt;/code&gt;automates this, given a list. In order to be general, the wording is a bit odd, but it’s better than writing it all out by hand! (Example output is in the comments to the source code).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reader might well be curious by this point what my Mnemosyne database looks like. I use Mnemosyne quite a bit, and as of 2020-02-02, I have 16,149 (active) cards in my deck.

        &lt;p&gt;Listing other neuroprosthetics is hard. It’s an interesting idea, but as proponents of externalism like Andy Clark have found, it’s easier to feel that externalism is meaningful than to nail down a clear definition which separates a neuroprosthetic or part of one’s mind from a random tool you like or find useful. Consider whether a pencil and paper a neuroprosthetic: clearly it is not for a child learning to write, who must carefully compose the words in his mind and put them down one after another, but it is not so clear for an adult who has been writing all his life and can doodle or write down thoughts without thinking about them and may even be surprised at what they happened to write.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I like this definition: “a neuroprosthetic is anything whose results you use without further thought”. So in the classic example, when Otto needs to go somewhere, he never thinks “I am an amnesiac who stores locations in my notepad, and I must look up the location” - he just looks up the location. A good heuristic would be anything whose destruction leaves one feeling lost, slow, stupid, or ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By this standard, I can think of only a few tools I use without noticeable thought:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;keybindings such as window manager shortcuts, in particular shortcuts for Google searches; on occasion, XMonad’s Prompt gets inscrutably wedged, locking it. When this happens, I have to restart X because I Google everything and the keybinding is so engrained that not using it is unbearable. It would be like trying to write with your weak hand.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google Calendar and PredictionBook: it is incredible how many followups or reminders or regularly happening tasks I can put into Google Calendar or PB. I have outsourced many habits or thoughts to them, and I no longer think of it as anything special. If either were gone, I would feel frightened - what events were passing, what beliefs falsified, what opportunities opening up (or closing!) that I had suddenly become ignorant of?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evernote, for a similar reason; many of my memories have ceased to be things like “octopuses see too fast to watch TV and so only HDTV or UHDTV works for them; I read this in Orion Magazine” and become things like “octopus TV Evernote”, and if I want to know what it was about octopuses &amp;amp; TV, well, I’ll have to look it up in Evernote. Mnemosyne plays a similar role for me, but there the memories are much clearer on their own because of the spaced repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;my website Gwern.net; I’ve had to say many times that I don’t know what I think about something, but whatever that is, it’s on my website. (A more extreme form of the Evernote/Mnemosyne neuroprosthetic.) A commenter once wrote that reading Gwern.net felt like he was crawling around in my head. He was more right than he realized.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;as quoted in “Retrieval practice and the maintenance of knowledge”, 1988↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;From “Close the Book. Recall. Write It Down: That old study method still works, researchers say. So why don’t professors preach it?”; The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two psychology journals have recently published papers showing that this strategy works, the latest findings from a decades-old body of research. When students study on their own, “active recall” - recitation, for instance, or flashcards and other self-quizzing - is the most effective way to inscribe something in long-term memory. Yet many college instructors are only dimly familiar with that research…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From “The Spacing Effect: A Case Study in the Failure to Apply the Results of Psychological Research” (1988), whose title alone summarizes the situation (see also 2007, Making Minds: What’s Wrong with Education - and What Should We Do About It?):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it [the spacing effect] is remarkably robust. In many cases, two spaced presentations are about twice as effective as two massed presentations (eg. Hintzman, 197451ya; Melton, 1970), and the difference between them increases as the frequency of repetition increases (Underwood, 197055ya)…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spacing effect was known as early as 1885140ya when Ebbinghaus published the results of his seminal work on memory. With himself as the subject, Ebbinghaus found that for a single 12-syllable series, 68 immediately successive repetitions had the effect of making possible an errorless recital after seven additional repetitions on the following day. However, the same effect was achieved by only 38 distributed repetitions spread over 3 days. On the basis of this and other related findings, Ebbinghaus concluded that ‘with any considerable number of repetitions a suitable distribution of them over a space of time is decidedly more advantageous than the massing of them at a single time’ (Ebbinghaus, 1885140ya/1913112ya. p. 89)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2012:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even after acknowledging the benefits of spacing, changing teaching practices proved to be enormously difficult. et al 2010 wrote: “Anecdotally, high school teachers and college professors seem to teach in a linear fashion without repetition and give three or four noncumulative exams.” (p. 130). Focusing on the math domain, where one might expect a very easy-to-review-and-to-space strategy, Rohrer (200916ya) points out that mathematics textbooks usually present topics in a non-spaced, non-mixed fashion. Even much earlier, Vash (198936ya) had written: “Education policy setters know perfectly well that [spaced practice] works better [than massed practice]. They don’t care. It isn’t tidy. It doesn’t let teachers teach a unit and dust off their hands quickly with a nice sense of ‘Well, that’s done.’” (p. 1547478ya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohrer, D. (200916ya). “The effects of spacing and mixing practice problems”. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 40, 4-17&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vash, C. L. (198936ya). “The spacing effect: A case study in the failure to apply the results of psychological research”. American Psychologist, 44, 1547478ya (a comment on Dempster’s article?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Psychology: An Introduction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;In one practical demonstration of the spacing effect, Bahrick, Bahrick, Bahrick, &amp;amp; Bahrick (199332ya) showed that retention of foreign language vocabulary was greatly enhanced if practice sessions were spaced far apart. For example, “Thirteen retraining sessions spaced at 56 days yielded retention comparable to 26 sessions spaced at 14 days.” In other words, subjects could use half as many study sessions, if the study sessions were spread over a time period four times as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Synaptic evidence for the efficacy of spaced learning”, et al 2012 (“Take your time: Neurobiology sheds light on the superiority of spaced versus massed learning”):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The superiority of spaced versus massed training is a fundamental feature of learning. Here, we describe unanticipated timing rules for the production of long-term potentiation (LTP) in adult rat hippocampal slices that can account for one temporal segment of the spaced trials phenomenon. Successive bouts of naturalistic theta burst stimulation of field CA1 afferents markedly enhanced previously saturated LTP if spaced apart by 1 h or longer, but were without effect when shorter intervals were used. Analyses of F-actin-enriched spines to identify potentiated synapses indicated that the added LTP obtained with delayed theta trains involved recruitment of synapses that were “missed” by the first stimulation bout. Single spine glutamate-uncaging experiments confirmed that less than half of the spines in adult hippocampus are primed to undergo plasticity under baseline conditions, suggesting that intrinsic variability among individual synapses imposes a repetitive presentation requirement for maximizing the percentage of potentiated connections. We propose that a combination of local diffusion from initially modified spines coupled with much later membrane insertion events dictate that the repetitions be widely spaced. Thus, the synaptic mechanisms described here provide a neurobiological explanation for one component of a poorly understood, ubiquitous aspect of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many studies to the effect that active recall is best. Here’s one recent study, “Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping”, 2011 (covered in Science Daily and the NYT):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educators rely heavily on learning activities that encourage elaborative studying, while activities that require students to practice retrieving and reconstructing knowledge are used less frequently. Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From “Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits”. New York Times;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Cognitive scientists do not deny that honest-to-goodness cramming can lead to a better grade on a given exam. But hurriedly jam-packing a brain is akin to speed-packing a cheap suitcase, as most students quickly learn - it holds its new load for a while, then most everything falls out….When the neural suitcase is packed carefully and gradually, it holds its contents for far, far longer. An hour of study tonight, an hour on the weekend, another session a week from now: such so-called spacing improves later recall, without requiring students to put in more overall study effort or pay more attention, dozens of studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that forgetting is the friend of learning”, said Dr. Kornell. “When you forget something, it allows you to relearn, and do so effectively, the next time you see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason cognitive scientists see testing itself - or practice tests and quizzes - as a powerful tool of learning, rather than merely assessment. The process of retrieving an idea is not like pulling a book from a shelf; it seems to fundamentally alter the way the information is subsequently stored, making it far more accessible in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of his own experiments, Dr. Roediger and Jeffrey Karpicke, who is now at Purdue University, had college students study science passages from a reading comprehension test, in short study periods. When students studied the same material twice, in back-to-back sessions, they did very well on a test given immediately afterward, then began to forget the material. But if they studied the passage just once and did a practice test in the second session, they did very well on one test two days later, and another given a week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mathematics of Gambling, 1984, §2 “The Wheels”, Chapter 4, pg43–44:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;It was the spring of 195570ya. I was finishing my second year of graduate physics at U.C.L.A…I changed my field of study from physics to mathematics…I attended classes and studied 50–60 hours a week, generally including Saturdays and Sundays. I had read about the psychology of learning in order to be able to work longer and harder. I found that “spaced learning” worked well: study for an hour, then take a break of at least ten minutes (shower, meal, tea, errands, etc.). One Sunday afternoon about 3 p.m., I came to the co-op dining room for a tea break…My head was bubbling with physics equations, and several of my good friends were sitting around chatting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Final Jeopardy: Man Versus Machine and the Quest to Know Everything, by Stephen Baker, pg214:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The program he put together tested him on categories, gauged his strengths (sciences, NFL football) and weaknesses (fashion, Broadway shows), and then directed him toward the preparation most likely to pay off in his own match. To patch these holes in his knowledge, Craig used a free online tool called Anki, which provides electronic flash cards for hundreds of fields of study, from Japanese vocabulary to European monarchs. The program, in Craig’s words, is based on psychological research on ‘the forgetting curve’. It helps people find holes in their knowledge and determines how often they need those areas to be reviewed to keep them in mind. In going over world capitals, for example, the system learns quickly that a user like Craig knows London, Paris, and Rome, so it might spend more time reinforcing the capital of, say, Kazakhstan. (And what would be the Kazakh capital? ‘Astana’, Craig said in a flash. ‘It used to be Almaty, but they moved it.’)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our Interview With Jeopardy! Champion Arthur Chu”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;[Chu:] …Jeopardy! is aimed at the sort of average TV viewer, so they’re not going to ask things that are pointlessly obscure…So I used a program called Anki which uses a method called “spaced repetition.” It keeps track of where you’re doing well or poorly, and pushes you to study the flashcards you don’t know as well, until you develop an even knowledge base about a particular subject, and I just made flashcards for those specific things. I memorized all the world capitals, it wasn’t that hard once I had the flashcards and was using them every day. I memorized the US State Nicknames (they’re on Wikipedia), memorized the basic important facts about the 44 US Presidents. I really focused on those. But there’s a lot more stuff to know. I went on Jeopardy! knowing that there was stuff I didn’t know. For instance, everyone laughs about sports - but I also knew that [sports clues] were the least likely to come up in Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy and be very important. So I decided I shouldn’t sweat it too much, I should just recognize that I didn’t know them and let that go, as long as I can get the high value clues. So that was how I prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

I had about 4000 users who had actually gone through a complete session…As guessed, the problem is that I couldn’t get people to start forming it as a habit. There is no immediate payback. Less than 20 people out of 4000 did more than one session…Additionally, there are at least 18 competitors. Here’s the list I made at the time. Very few seem to be successful. I shut the site down about a month ago. There are numerous free competitors which don’t have any great annoyances. I wouldn’t suggest starting another of these sites unless you figured out an effective way to “gamify” it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…~4000 people finished a session. Many more ‘tried’ than 4000…I just couldn’t determine which users were bots that registered randomly vs users that didn’t finish the first session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tried: lots (but unknown)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finished 1 session: ~4000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finished &amp;gt;1 session: ~20 [0.5%]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Play it Again: The Master Psychopharmacology Program as an Example of Interval Learning in Bite-Sized Portions”, et al 2010:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Since Ebbinghaus’ time, a voluminous amount of research has confirmed this simple but important fact: the retention of new information degrades rapidly unless it is reviewed in some manner. A modern example of this loss of knowledge without repetition is a study of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills that demonstrated rapid decay in the year following training. By 3 years post-training only 2.4% were able to perform CPR successfully.6 Another recent study of physicians taking a tutorial they rated as very good or excellent showed mean knowledge scores increasing from 50% before the tutorial to 76% immediately afterward.7 However, score gains were only half as great 3-8 days later and incredibly, there was no [statistically-]significant knowledge retention measurable at all at 55 days.7 Similar results have been reported by us in follow-up studies of knowledge retention from continuing medical education programs.1 [Stahl SM, Davis RL. Best Practices for Medical Educators. Carlsbad, CA: NEI Press; 200916ya]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…This may be due to the fact that lectures with assigned reading are the easiest for teachers. Also, medical learning is rarely measured immediately after a lecture or after reading new material for the first time and then measured again a few days or weeks later, so that the low retention rates of this approach may not be widely appreciated.1,4 No wonder formal medical education conferences without enabling or practice-reinforcing strategies appear to have relatively little impact on practice and healthcare outcomes.8,9,10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One study looking at cramming is the 199332ya “Cramming: A barrier to student success, a way to beat the system or an effective learning strategy?”, et al 1993, abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tested the hypothesis that cramming is an ineffective study strategy by examining the weekly study diaries of 166 undergraduates. All subjects also completed an end-of-semester questionnaire measuring study habits. subjects were classified in the following study patterns: ideal, confident, zealous, or crammer. Contrary to the hypothesis, results suggest that cramming is an effective approach, most widespread in courses using take-home essay examinations and major research papers. Crammers’ grades were as good as or better than those of subjects using other strategies; the longer subjects were in college, the more likely it was that they crammed. Crammers studied more hours than most students and were as interested in their courses as other students.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note that there is no measure of long-term retention, suggesting that people who only care about grades are rationally choosing to cram.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anki has its Cram Mode and Mnemosyne 2.0 has a cramming plugin. When a SRS doesn’t have explicit support, it’s always possible to ‘game’ the algorithm by setting one’s scores artificially low, so the SR algorithm thinks you are stupid and need to do a lot of repetitions.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Examining the examiners: Why are we so bad at assessing students?”, 2002:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Conway, 1992 looked at long term memory for the information presented on a psychology course. They found that some types of information, especially that relating to research methods, were remembered better than others. But in a follow up analysis, they found that the type of assessment used had an effect on memory. In essence, material assessed by continuous assessment was more likely to be remembered than information assessed by exams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;2010:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;For example, simple restudying allows the learner to reexperience all of the material but actually produces poor long-term retention.25,26,35 Why do students keep studying the original materials? Certainly if this is their only choice, then restudying is a necessary tactic. Another answer may be that repeated studying falsely inflates students’ confidence in their ability to remember in the future because they sense that they understand it now, and they and their instructors may be unaware of the many studies that show poor retention on delayed testing after this form of repetition.25,26,35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;From et al 2010:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the massing-aids-induction hypothesis, final test performance was consistently and considerably superior in the spaced condition. A large majority of participants, however, judged massing to be more effective than spacing, despite making the judgment after taking the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Metacognitive judgments-that is, judgments about one’s own memory and cognition-are often based on feelings of fluency(eg. see Benjamin, Bjork, &amp;amp; Schwartz, 1998; Rhodes &amp;amp; Castel, 2008). Because massing naturally leads to feelings of fluency and increases short-term task performance during learning, learners frequently rate spacing as less effective than massing, even when their performance shows the opposite pattern (1978; Kornell &amp;amp; Bjork, 200817ya; Simon &amp;amp; Bjork, 200124ya; Zechmeister &amp;amp; Shaughnessy, 198045ya). Averaged across Kornell and Bjork’s (200817ya) experiments, for example, more than 80% of participants rated massing as equally or more effective than spacing, whereas only 15% of participants actually performed better in the massed condition than in the spaced condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Such an illusion was apparent in the induction condition. Contrary to previous research, however, participants gave higher ratings for spacing than massing during repetition learning (see, eg. Simon &amp;amp; Bjork, 200124ya; Zechmeister &amp;amp; Shaughnessy, 198045ya). This outcome may have occurred because of a process of a habituation: Six presentations and a total of 30 s spent studying a single painting may have come to seem inefficient and pointless. Thus, there appears to be a turning point in metacognitive ratings based on fluency: As fluency increases, metacognitive ratings increase up to a point, but as fluency continues to increase and encoding or retrieval becomes too easy, metacognitive ratings may begin to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…In advance of their research, 2008 were convinced that such inductive learning would benefit from massing, yet their results showed the opposite. Undaunted, we remained convinced that spacing would be more beneficial for repetition learning than for inductive learning- especially for older adults, given their overall declines in episodic memory. The current results disconfirmed our expectations once again. If our intuitions are erroneous, despite our years spent proving and praising the spacing effect-including roughly 40 years’ worth contributed by Robert A. Bjork-those of the average student are surely mistaken as well (as the inaccuracy of the participants’ metacognitive ratings suggests). We have, perhaps, fallen victim to the illusion that making learning easy makes learning effective, rather than recognizing that spacing is a desirable difficulty (1994) that enhances inductive learning as well as repetition learning well into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Thus, while spacing may boost learning, it may be thought to be relatively inefficient in terms of study time. As we discuss later, this feeling of inefficiency may be one of the reasons that spacing is not the more popular strategy. Interestingly, in that same study (1978; and see also 1985 and 1954 [Experimental Psychology]), there was evidence of such a thing as laboring in vain. That is, exceeding a certain number of hours of practice a day (more than approximately 2h) led to no increases in learning, as might be expected. Related to the deficient-processing theory mentioned above, these results are crucial in understanding intuitively how the spacing effect works: We simply get burnt out. These data are also analogous to the cognitive literature on overlearning, which shows that while continuous study over long periods of time might seem beneficial (and even feel good) in the short-term, the benefits disappear soon afterwards ( et al 2005; 2006)…In the above-described 1978’s study, for example, after postal workers practiced typing in either massed or spaced study sessions, they had to indicate how satisfied they were with the training. Results showed that while spacing led to the best learning, it was the least liked. Similarly, 2001 found that people preferred the massing strategy on a motor learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baddeley, A. D., &amp;amp; Longman, D. J. A.

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Study strategies of college students: Are self-testing and scheduling related to achievement?”, 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies, such as those by Kornell and Bjork (Psychonomic Bulletin &amp;amp; Review, 14:219-224, 200718ya) and Karpicke, Butler, and Roediger (Memory, 17:471-479, 200916ya), have surveyed college students’ use of various study strategies, including self-testing and rereading. These studies have documented that some students do use self-testing (but largely for monitoring memory) and rereading, but the researchers did not assess whether individual differences in strategy use were related to student achievement. Thus, we surveyed 324 undergraduates about their study habits as well as their college grade point average (GPA). Importantly, the survey included questions about self-testing, scheduling one’s study, and a checklist of strategies commonly used by students or recommended by cognitive research. Use of self-testing and rereading were both positively associated with GPA. Scheduling of study time was also an important factor: Low performers were more likely to engage in late-night studying than were high performers; massing (versus spacing) of study was associated with the use of fewer study strategies overall; and all students-but especially low performers-were driven by impending deadlines. Thus, self-testing, rereading, and scheduling of study play important roles in real-world student achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(See also et al 2013.) Note the self-testing correlation excludes flashcards, a result that both the authors and me found surprising. The sleep connection is interesting, given the hypothesized link between stronger memory formation &amp;amp; studying before a good night’s sleep - you can hardly get a good night’s sleep if you are cramming late into the night (correlated with lower grades) but you can if you do so at a reasonable time in the evening (in time to get a solid night).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Susser &amp;amp; 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Laboratory studies have demonstrated the long-term memory benefits of studying material in multiple distributed sessions as opposed to one massed session, given an identical amount of overall study time (ie. the spacing effect). The current study goes beyond the laboratory to investigate whether undergraduates know about the advantage of spaced study, to what extent they use it in their own studying, and what factors might influence its utilization. Results from a web-based survey indicated that participants (n = 285) were aware of the benefits of spaced study and would use a higher level of spacing under ideal compared to realistic circumstances. However, self-reported use of spacing was intermediate, similar to massing and several other study strategies, and ranked well below commonly used strategies such as rereading notes. Several factors were endorsed as important in the decision to distribute study time, including the perceived difficulty of an upcoming exam, the amount of material to learn, how heavily an exam is weighed in the course grade, and the value of the material. Further, level of metacognitive self-regulation and use of elaboration strategies were associated with higher rates of spaced study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;To investigate the intensity of instructional interactions, Art Graesser and Natalie 1994 compared questioning and answering in classrooms with those in tutorial settings.5 They found that classroom groups of students ask about three questions an hour and that any single student in a classroom asks about 0.11 questions per hour. In contrast, they found that students in individual tutorial sessions asked 20-30 questions an hour and were required to answer 117-146 questions per hour. Reviews of the intensity of interaction that occurs in technology-based instruction have found even more active student response levels. [J. D. Fletcher, Technology, the Columbus Effect, and the Third Revolution in Learning.]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although 1994 also found that sheer number of questions was not necessarily important, suggesting diminishing marginal returns or perhaps bad question asking.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, this moment is different for every person and each bit of information. Imagine a pile of thousands of flash cards.

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the 200817ya meta-analysis, “Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence” (APS press release); from the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;…in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;From et al 2007, describing 1939, “Studies in retention”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Spitzer (193986ya) incorporated a form of expanded retrieval in a study designed to assess the ability of sixth graders to learn science facts. Impressively, Spitzer tested over 3600 students in Iowa-the entire sixth-grade population of 91 elementary schools at the time. The students read two articles, one on peanuts and the other on bamboo, and were given a 25-item multiple choice test to assess their knowledge (such as ‘To which family of plants does bamboo belong?’). Spitzer tested a total of nine groups, manipulating both the timing of the test (administered immediately or after various delays) and the number of identical tests students received (one to three). Spitzer did not incorporate massed or equal interval retrieval conditions, but he had at least two groups that were tested on an expanding schedule of retrieval, in which the intervals between tests were separated by the passage of time (in days) rather than by intervening to-be-learned information. For example, in one of the groups, the first test was given immediately, the second test was given seven days after the first test, and the third test was given 63 days after the second test. Thus, in essence, this group was tested on a 0-7-63 day expanding retrieval schedule. Spitzer compared performance of the expanded retrieval group to a group given a single test 63 days after reading the original article. On the first (immediate) test, the expanded retrieval group correctly answered 53% of the questions. After 63 days and two previous tests, their score was still an impressive 43%. The single test group correctly answered only 25% of the original items after 63 days, giving the expanded retrieval group an 18% retention advantage. This is quite impressive, given that this large benefit remained after a 63-day retention interval. Similar beneficial effects were found in a group tested on a 0-1-21 day expanded retrieval schedule compared to a group given a single test after 21 days. Of course, this study does not decouple the effects of testing from spacing or expansion, but the results do clearly indicate considerable learning and retention using the expanded repeated testing procedure. Spitzer concluded that ‘…examinations are learning devices and should not be considered only as tools for measuring achievement of pupils’ (p. 656, italics added)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The spacing effect describes the robust finding that long-term learning is promoted when learning events are spaced out in time, rather than presented in immediate succession. Studies of the spacing effect have focused on memory processes rather than for other types of learning, such as the acquisition and generalization of new concepts. In this study, early elementary school children (5-7 year-olds; N = 36) were presented with science lessons on one of three schedules: massed, clumped, and spaced. The results revealed that spacing lessons out in time resulted in higher generalization performance for both simple and complex concepts. Spaced learning schedules promote several types of learning, strengthening the implications of the spacing effect for educational practices and curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;et al 2007 review:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No feedback or correction was given to subjects if they made errors or omitted answers. 1978 found that the expanding-interval schedule produced better recall than equal-interval testing on a final test at the end of the session, and equal-interval testing, in turn, produced better recall than did initial massed testing. Thus, despite the fact that massed testing produced nearly errorless performance during the acquisition phase, the other two schedules produced better retention on the final test given at the end of the session. However, the difference favoring the expanding retrieval schedule over the equal-interval schedule was fairly small at around 10%. In research following up Landauer and Bjork’s (197847ya) original experiments, practically all studies have found that spaced schedules of retrieval (whether equal-interval or expanding schedules) produce better retention on a final test given later than do massed retrieval tests given immediately after presentation (eg. Cull, 200025ya; Cull, Shaughnessy, &amp;amp; Zechmeister, 199629ya), although exceptions do exist. For example, in Experiments 3 and 4 of et al 1996, massed testing produced performance as good as equal-interval testing on a 5-5-5 schedule, but most other experiments have found that any spaced schedule of testing (either equal-interval or expanding) is better than a massed schedule for performance on a delayed test. However, whether expanding schedules are better than equal-interval schedules for long-term retention-the other part of Landauer and Bjork’s interesting findings-remains an open question. Balota, Duchek, and Logan (in press) have provided a thorough consideration of the relevant evidence and have shown that it is mixed at best, and that most researchers have found no difference between the two schedules of testing. That is, performance on a final test at the end of a session often shows no difference in performance between equal-interval and expanding retrieval schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cull, for those curious (Cull, W. L. (200025ya). “Untangling the benefits of multiple study opportunities and repeated testing for cued recall”. Applied Cognitive Psychology, 14, 215-235):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Cull (200025ya) compared expanded retrieval to equal interval spaced retrieval in a series of four experiments designed to mimic typical teaching or study strategies encountered by students. He examined the role of testing versus simply restudying the material, feedback, and various retention intervals on final test performance. Paired associates (an uncommon word paired with a common word, such as bairn-print) were presented in a manner similar to the flashcard techniques students often use to learn vocabulary words. The intervals between retrieval attempts of to-be-learned information ranged from minutes in some experiments to days in others. Interestingly, across four experiments, Cull did not find any evidence of an advantage of an expanded condition over a uniform spaced condition (ie. no [substantial] expanded retrieval effect), although both conditions consistently produced large advantages over massed presentations. He concluded that distributed testing of any kind, expanded or equal interval, can be an effective learning aid for teachers to provide for their students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The et al 2007 review offers a synthesis of current theories on how massed and spaced differ, based on memory encoding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to encoding variability theory, performance on a memory test is dependent upon the overlap between the contextual information available at the time of test and the contextual information available during encoding. During massed study, there is relatively little time for contextual elements to fluctuate between presentations and so this condition produces the highest performance in an immediate memory test, when the test context strongly overlaps with the same contextual information encoded during both of the massed presentations. In contrast, when there is spacing between the items, there is time for fluctuation to take place between the presentations during study, and hence there is an increased likelihood of having multiple unique contexts encoded. Because a delayed test will also allow fluctuation of context, it is better to have multiple unique contexts encoded, as in the spaced presentation format, as opposed to a single encoded context, as in the massed presentation format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;et al 2010 did 3 experiments on reading comprehension:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;On a test 1 week later, recall was enhanced by the expanding schedule, but only when the task between successive retrievals was highly interfering with memory for the passage. These results suggest that the extent to which learners benefit from expanding retrieval practice depends on the degree to which the to-be-learned information is vulnerable to forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Mnemosyne’s Principles page:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The Mnemosyne algorithm is very similar to SM2 used in one of the early versions of SuperMemo. There are some modifications that deal with early and late repetitions, and also to add a small, healthy dose of randomness to the intervals. Supermemo now uses SM11. However, we are a bit skeptical that the huge complexity of the newer SM algorithms provides for a statistically relevant benefit. But, that is one of the facts we hope to find out with our data collection. We will only make modifications to our algorithms based on common sense or if the data tells us that there is a statistically relevant reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;et al 2007:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Carpenter and DeLosh (200520ya, Exp. 2) have recently investigated face-name learning under massed, expanded (1-3-5), and equal interval (3-3-3) conditions. This study also involved study and study and test procedures during the acquisition phase. Carpenter and DeLosh found a large effect of spacing, but no evidence of a benefit of expanded over equal interval practice. In fact, Carpenter and DeLosh reported a reliable benefit of the equal interval condition over the expanded retrieval condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;et al 2007 again:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;1985 tested the effectiveness of expanded retrieval in a third-grade classroom setting. In separate conditions, students were given new multiplication problems or spelling words to learn. The problem or word was presented audiovisually once and then tested on either a massed retrieval schedule of 0-0-0-0 or an expanding schedule of 0-1-2-4, in which the intervals involved being tested on old items or learning new items. After each test trial for a given item, the item was re-presented in its entirety so students received feedback on what they were learning. Performance during the learning phase was at 100% for both spelling words and multiplication facts. On an immediate final retention test, Rea and Modigliani found a performance advantage for all items-math and spelling- practiced on an expanding schedule compared to the massed retrieval schedule. They suggested, as have others, that spacing combined with the high success rate inherent in the expanded retrieval schedule produced better retention than massed retrieval practice. However, as in Spitzer’s study, Rea and Modigliani did not test an appropriate equal interval spacing condition. Hence, their finding that expanded retrieval is superior to massed retrieval in third graders could simply reflect the superiority of spaced versus massed rehearsal-in other words, the spacing effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

For example, in the latter study, Camp et al employed an expanding retrieval strategy to train 23 individuals with mild to moderate AD to refer to a daily calendar as a cue to remember to perform various personal activities (eg. take medication). Following a baseline phase to determine whether subjects would spontaneously use the calendar, spaced retrieval training was implemented by repeatedly asking the subject the question, ‘How are you going to remember what to do each day?’ at expanding time intervals. The results indicated that 20/23 subjects did learn the strategy (ie. to look at the calendar) and retained it over a 1-week period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;2006 warns us, though, about many of the other math studies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;In one meta-analysis by 1999, for instance, the size of the spacing effect declined sharply as conceptual difficulty of the task increased from low (eg. rotary pursuit) to average (eg. word list recall) to high (eg. puzzle). By this finding, the benefits of spaced practise may be muted for many mathematics tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is especially nice about this study was that not only did it use high-quality (intelligent &amp;amp; motivated) college students (United States Air Force Academy), the conditions were relatively controlled - both groups had the same homework (so equal testing effect), but like 2006/2007, the distribution was what varied:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The course topics, textbook, handouts, reading assignments, and graded assignments (with the exception of quiz, homework, and participation points) were identical for the treatment and control groups. The listing of homework assignments in the syllabus differed between groups. The control group was assigned daily homework related to the topic(s) presented that day in class. Peterson (197154ya) calls this the vertical model for assigning mathematics homework. The treatment group was assigned homework in accordance with a distributed organizational pattern that combines practice on current topics and reinforcement of previously covered topics. Under the distributed model, approximately 40% of the problems on a given topic were assigned the day the topic was first introduced, with an additional 20% assigned on the next lesson and the remaining 40% of problems on the topic assigned on subsequent lessons (Hirsch et al, 198342ya). In Hirsch’s research and in this study, after the initial homework assignment, problem(s) representing a given topic resurfaced on the 2nd, 4th, 7th, 12th, and 21st lesson. Consequently, treatment group homework for lesson one consisted of only one topic; homework for lessons two and three consisted of two topics; and homework for lesson four through six consisted of three topics. This pattern continued as new topics were added and was applied to all non-exam, non-laboratory lessons. As shown by Tables 1 and 2, the same homework problems were assigned to both groups with only the pattern of assignment differing. Because of the nature of the distributed practice model, homework for the treatment group contained fewer problems (relative to the control group) early in the semester with the number of problems increasing as the semester progressed. Later in the semester, homework for the treatment group contained more problems (relative to the control group)….The USAFA routinely collects study time data. After each exam, a large sample of cadets (at least 60% of the course population) anonymously reported the amount of time (in minutes) spent studying for the exam. Time spent studying was approximately equal for both groups (see Table 5). Descriptive data revels that, for both the treatment and control group, study time for the third exam was at least 16% greater than study time for any other exam. Study time for the final exam was at least 68% greater than study time for any of the hourly exams (see Table 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…The treatment produced an effect size (f 2) of 0.013 on the first exam, 0.029 on the second exam, 0.035 on the fourth exam, and 0.040 on the final course percentage grade. Although the effect sizes appear to be small, the treatment group outscored the control group in every case. A mean difference of 5.13 percentage points on the first, second, and fourth exam translates to an advantage of about a third of a letter grade for students in the treatment group. In addition, higher minimum scores earned by the treatment group may indicate that the distributed practice treatment served to eliminate the extremely low scores (refer to Table 3)….Oddly, the distributed practice treatment did not produce a [statistically-]significant effect on final exam scores. One possible cause for the disparity was the USAFA policy exempting the top performers from the final exam. Of the 16 exempted students, 11 were from the treatment group with only 5 from the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;2006 abstract:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;Two introductory psychology classes (N = 145) participated in a counterbalanced classroom experiment that demonstrated the spacing effect and, by analogy, the benefits of distributed study. After hearing words presented twice in either a massed or distributed manner, participants recalled the words and scored their recall protocols, reliably remembering more distributed than massed words. Posttest scores on a multiple-choice quiz covering points illustrated by the experiment averaged about twice the comparable pretest scores, indicating the effectiveness of the exercise in conveying content. Students’ subjective ratings suggested that the experiment helped convince them of the benefits of distributed study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

When learning was incidental and a shallow processing task requiring little semantic processing was used during list presentation, young adults still exhibited a spacing effect, but children consistently failed to do so. Children, however, did manifest a spacing effect in incidental learning when an elaborate semantic processing task was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The famous ‘10,000 hours of practice’ figure may not be as true or important as Ericsson and publicizers like Malcolm Gladwell imply, given the high variance of expertise against time, and results from sports showing smaller time investments (see also Hambrick’s corpus cutting ‘deliberate practice’ down to size), and Ericsson absurdly deny the powerful role of genetics and the necessary condition of having talent but the insight of ‘deliberate practice’ helping talented people probably is real. One may be able to get away with 3,000 hours rather than 10,000, but one isn’t going to do that with mindless repetition or no repetitions.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;From et al 2010:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The benefits of spacing seem to diminish or disappear when to-be-learned items are not repeated exactly (Appleton-Knapp, Bjork, &amp;amp; Wickens, 2005)…a number of studies have shown that massing, rather than spacing, promotes inductive learning. These studies have generally employed relatively simple perceptual stimuli that facilitate experimental control (Gagné, 1950; Goldstone, 1996; Kurtz &amp;amp; Hovland, 1956; [Whitman J. R., &amp;amp; Garner, W. R. (196362ya). “Concept learning as a function of the form of internal structure”. Journal of Verbal Learning &amp;amp; Verbal Behavior, 2, 195-202]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;High error rates - indicating one didn’t actually learn the card contents in the first place - seem to be connected to failures of the spacing effect; there’s some evidence that people naturally choose to mass study when they don’t yet know the material.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20 years look like this (note the scientific notation):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[0.742675, 0.27044575182838654, 0.15275979054767388, 0.10348750000000001, 7.751290630254386e-2, 6.187922936397532e-2, 5.161829250474865e-2, 4.445884397854832e-2, 3.923055555555555e-2, 3.5275438307530015e-2, 3.219809429218694e-2, 2.9748098818459235e-2, 2.7759942051635768e-2, 2.6120309801216147e-2, 2.474928593068675e-2, 2.35890625e-2, 2.2596898475825956e-2, 2.1740583401051353e-2, 2.0995431241707652e-2, 2.0342238287817983e-2]&lt;/code&gt;↩︎&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;modulo things where knowing it is useful even if you don’t need it often - it can be a brick in a pyramid of knowledge; cf. page 3 of Wolf:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The problem of forgetting might not torment us so much if we could only convince ourselves that remembering isn’t important. Perhaps the things we learn - words, dates, formulas, historical and biographical details - don’t really matter. Facts can be looked up. That’s what the Internet is for. When it comes to learning, what really matters is how things fit together. We master the stories, the schemas, the frameworks, the paradigms; we rehearse the lingo; we swim in the episteme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of this comforting notion is that it’s false. “The people who criticize memorization - how happy would they be to spell out every letter of every word they read?” asks Robert Bjork, chair of UCLA’s psychology department and one of the most eminent memory researchers. After all, Bjork notes, children learn to read whole words through intense practice, and every time we enter a new field we become children again. “You can’t escape memorization,” he says. “There is an initial process of learning the names of things. That’s a stage we all go through. It’s all the more important to go through it rapidly.” The human brain is a marvel of associative processing, but in order to make associations, data must be loaded into memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See Stephen R. Schmidt’s webpage “Theories of Forgetting”, which cites ‘Woodworth &amp;amp; Schlosbeg (196164ya)’ when presenting a log graph of various studies’ forgetting curves.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;which neatly addresses the issue of such mailing lists being useless (‘who learns a word after just one exposure?’).↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mnemosyne in this case constitutes both a way to learn the quotes so I can use them, and a waste book; just the other day I had 3 or 4 apposite quotes for an essay because I had entered them into Mnemosyne months or years ago.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s well known that any speaker of a language understands many more words than they will ever use or be able to explicitly generate, that their “reading vocabulary” exceeds their “writing vocabulary”; less well-known is that on many problems, one can guess at well above random rates even while feeling unsure &amp;amp; ignorant, necessitating psychologists to employ forced-choice paradigms to reveal such “dark knowledge”. Even less known is the capacity of recognition memory or “implicit memory” (cf. McCollough effect); this memory can apply to things like recognizing images or text or music, typing, puzzle solving, etc. Andrew Drucker, in “Multiplying 10-digit numbers using Flickr: The power of recognition memory”, employs visual memory to calculate 9,883,603,368 × 4,288,997,768 = 42,390,752,785,149,282,624; he cites as precedent 1973:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In one of the most widely-cited studies on recognition memory, Standing showed participants an epic 10,000 photographs over the course of 5 days, with 5 seconds’ exposure per image. He then tested their familiarity, essentially as described above. The participants showed an 83% success rate, suggesting that they had become familiar with about 6,600 images during their ordeal. Other volunteers, trained on a smaller collection of 1,000 images selected for vividness, had a 94% success rate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One sometimes sees people argue that something is insecure or unguessable or free from possible placebo effect because it involves too many objects to explicitly memorize, but as these examples make clear, recognition memory can happen quickly and store surprisingly large amounts of information. This could be used for authentication (see for example et al 2012; HN discussion) or message since recognition memory could be exploited as a sort of secure communication system. Two parties can share a set of 20,000 photographs (10,000 pairs); to send a message, have a messenger spend 5 days on 10,000 picked ones; and then to receive it, ask him to recognize which photograph he saw in each of the 10,000 pairs. The subject not only does not know what the binary message is or what means, he can’t even produce it since he cannot remember the photographs!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At an 80% accuracy rate, we can even calculate how many bits of information can be entrusted to the messenger using Shannon’s theorem; a calculation gives 5.8 kilobits as the upper limit: if p = 0.2 (based on the 80% success rate), then 10000 / (1 − (p × log2 p + (1 − p) × (log2 (1 − p)))) = 5,807.44. (This message can, of course, be encrypted.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So we see that Frank Herbert was right after all: the securest way to send a message is through a “distrans” messenger! (The downside is that the implicit recognition memory decays; see 1986 for adjusted estimates.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This system is even more interesting because the learning happens unconsciously, without volition, so the subject does not need to cooperate nor even know about it (they could be exposed to key images without realizing it, such as through ‘advertising’). Further, recognition of an image also happens unconsciously, and can be observed by EEG ERPs &amp;amp; fMRI (and probably other neural correlates or modalities like eyetracking or skin galvanic response). Thus, messages can be stored &amp;amp; retrieved both unconsciously &amp;amp; involuntarily in brains!↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this vein, I am reminded of what a former polyphasic sleeper told me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;I’ve been polyphasic for about a year. (Not anymore; kills my memory.)…Anki reps, mostly. I found that I could do proper review sessions for about 2–3 days and would hit an impenetrable wall. I couldn’t learn a single new card and had total brain fog until I got 3 hours more sleep. That, however, would reset my adaptation. The whole effect is a bit less pronounced on Everyman, but not much. It is however easier to add sleep when you already have a core. I didn’t notice any other major mental impairment after the initial sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a more recent review, see et al 2013.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Presumably one would immediately give them all some high grade like 5 to avoid suddenly having a daily load of 500 cards for a while.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Smaller is better.↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“For Mnemosyne 2.x, Ullrich is working on an official Mnemosyne iPhone client which will have very easy syncing.”↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Page 4, 2008:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;The spacing effect was one of the proudest lab-derived discoveries, and it was interesting precisely because it was not obvious, even to professional teachers. The same year that Neisser revolted, Robert Bjork, working with Thomas Landauer of Bell Labs, published the results of two experiments involving nearly 700 undergraduate students. Landauer and Bjork were looking for the optimal moment to rehearse something so that it would later be remembered. Their results were impressive: The best time to study something is at the moment you are about to forget it. And yet - as Neisser might have predicted - that insight was useless in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When I first read of SuperMemo, I had already taken a class in cognitive psychology and was reasonably familiar with Ebbinghaus’s forgetting curve - so my reaction to its methodology was Huxley’s: “How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!”↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;See page 7, 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote/&gt;↩︎&lt;p&gt;And yet now, as I grin broadly and wave to the gawkers, it occurs to me that the cold rationality of his approach may be only a surface feature and that, when linked to genuine rewards, even the chilliest of systems can have a certain visceral appeal. By projecting the achievement of extreme memory back along the forgetting curve, by provably linking the distant future - when we will know so much - to the few minutes we devote to studying today, Wozniak has found a way to condition his temperament along with his memory. He is making the future noticeable. He is trying not just to learn many things but to warm the process of learning itself with a draft of utopian ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Your team's on-call AI engineer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Keystone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building AI-native error monitoring that automatically investigates production issues and generates code fixes. Think Sentry, but built from the ground up for a world where AI can actually understand your codebase, trace through logs, and tell you exactly what broke and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're starting here and expanding until we're the default tool for building product, period. Our mission is to free engineers from the drudgery of digging through logs, setting up systems, and debugging- so they can focus on understanding users and designing great products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're in-person in SoMa, San Francisco. We raised a $5.2M seed from True Ventures, Twenty Two Ventures, Pear VC, and Ritual Capital- plus the founders of YC, Dropbox, Supabase, Eight Sleep, Graphite, Resend, RocketMoney, and more. Early design partners include teams at Perplexity and Lovable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About the Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'd be the first engineering hire, working directly with me (the founder) to build the core product. You'll have more ownership and influence over the product, culture, and technical direction than you'd get almost anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example projects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be a great fit if you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: TypeScript, React (Next.js), Python, Postgres, Redis, AWS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comp &amp;amp; benefits: Top-of-market salary + significant equity, full health/dental/vision, all meals covered, equipment budget&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 2-3 short technicals. After, we'll schedule an onsite in our office, where you'll work on a small project, discuss ideas, and get a sense for our in-person culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it's "entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology," without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders "will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology," the post said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq added that it will continue as an "independent company," led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said "GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads," Huang wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huang added that, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, AI model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X "moonshot factory." Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering "at this time," but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cerebras filed for an IPO in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s assault on the city of Chicago began in September, and it claimed its first casualty quickly. As Reuters would later report, on September 12, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez dropped his kids off at their school in the suburb of Franklin Park on his way to his job at a diner on the northwest side. Villegas-Gonzalez had come to the United States in 2007 to flee the violence in his home state of Michoacán, Mexico—violence wrought by the Mexican government’s militarization of its drug war, a policy encouraged and funded by the United States. (In November, the mayor of the city of Uruapan was assassinated after calling for a crackdown on organized crime.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Described by friends and co-workers as kind and soft-spoken, Villegas-Gonzalez had two sons and met a woman from his hometown as he worked long hours in kitchens around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After he dropped off his sons on the morning of September 12, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers approached the 38-year-old in his car. He put the vehicle in reverse and attempted to flee. One officer continued to chase him on foot and eventually fired his weapon, striking Villegas-Gonzalez, who crashed into a delivery truck and was pronounced dead an hour later. Officials of the Department of Homeland Security would later say that Villegas-Gonzalez “drove his car at law enforcement officers,” a claim clearly refuted by surveillance video. DHS also claimed the officer who killed Villegas-Gonzalez had been struck and dragged by the car and feared for his life. That allegation is more difficult to confirm or refute—the officer is obscured by the car in the video. The officer was later treated for “minor” injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Villegas-Gonzalez had no criminal record. Over eight years, he had only a series of traffic citations for offenses like a broken taillight and driving without insurance. His most serious citation was for driving 30 miles per hour over the speed limit. In its press release laying out the ICE agents’ version of events, DHS referred to him as “a criminal illegal alien with a history of reckless driving.” The release included the striking line, “The illegal alien was pronounced dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the weeks that followed, immigration agents continued to arrest parents and nannies as they dropped off and picked up children from school, a tactic unheard of in prior administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videos posted to social media showed ICE and Border Patrol agents pointing their guns at unarmed protesters, unnecessarily tackling children and elderly people, and shutting down streets and intersections as they extracted people from their cars. Agents tear-gassed entire neighborhoods, in some cases enveloping schools and even Chicago Police Department officers in clouds of chemical irritant. Videos showed federal officers engaging in Precision Immobilization Technique, or PIT, maneuvers to cut off fleeing vehicles, a dangerous tactic banned or limited by the Chicago Police Department and many other police agencies in the country. On at least three occasions, ICE officers violently pulled U.S. citizens from their cars and detained them, claiming the drivers had deliberately crashed into agents—despite video and witness accounts contradicting the officers’ narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As October dragged on, the raids intensified. Toward the end of the month, immigration officers gassed a neighborhood just hours before a scheduled Halloween parade for children. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker asked the administration to pause the raids on Halloween night so Chicago kids could go trick-or-treating without fear of being gassed, witnessing traumatic arrests, or seeing their parents or caretakers apprehended and detained. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem refused, calling the request “shameful.” Activists in Los Angeles would later photograph immigration officers, in an especially galling display of cruelty, wearing Halloween masks depicting horror movie villains while conducting immigration raids. When the citizen journalism site L.A. Taco asked DHS for comment, a spokesperson replied, “Happy Halloween.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trump has launched similar federal crackdowns in Los Angeles, Washington, Charlotte, Memphis, Minneapolis, and New Orleans, and threatened them in Baltimore, San Francisco, New York, and other cities. He has sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles and Memphis, and has promised to send more to other cities, along with active-duty troops. With astonishing speed, the administration has toppled the most cherished pillars of a free society. Masked secret police now tear-gas entire city streets, jump out from unmarked vehicles to abduct and detain suspected undocumented people, and demand that foreign-looking people (mostly Latino) produce papers on demand. These deportation forces have been told by the president and his advisers to cast a wide net, that immigrants are “animals,” that the activists defending them are “domestic terrorists,” and that the officers themselves have “immunity” from any form of accountability. Meanwhile, administration lawyers have brazenly lied to federal judges to supplement those deportation forces by deploying U.S. troops to the streets of American cities—seeking to break this country’s healthy antipathy toward domestic use of the military policing that dates back to the founding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’re assaulting basic democratic ideals on all fronts,” said Dana Marks, an immigration judge who retired in 2021. “It’s really just classic authoritarianism. It always starts with the minorities. It always starts with the immigrants. If we don’t stop them, it will be American citizens. Congress, the courts, the people, we should all be jumping up and down and screaming about this. We need to be screaming that this isn’t America—that this isn’t who we are.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;“A Disgrace to Policing”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing and reporting on policing in the United States for more than 20 years. I’ve spent much of that time writing about the effects of police militarization, or the way military weapons, training, uniforms, and culture have infiltrated domestic law enforcement agencies. But I’ve never seen anything quite like the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve seen rapid normalization of abuses we once associated with authoritarian regimes or the old Iron Curtain countries. It’s now routine for masked, unidentifiable government agents to sweep people off the street and whisk them away in unmarked vehicles. Some of those arrested have been quickly shuttled off to detention facilities in other parts of the country without any notification to their families or attorneys. Others have been sent to a third country, often a country in the developing world to which they have no connection. Still others have been explicitly targeted for their political opinions, their activism, or their journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phrase “your papers, please” has historically been the sort of demand we associated with Hitler’s SS or the East German Stasi. Immigration officers now routinely stop people who simply “look like” immigrants and demand they prove their citizenship or legal residency. Legal residents who fail to produce documentation on demand have been fined, and flustered immigrants who fail to produce sufficient records or recall a Social Security number have been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The administration is also shredding due process. The United States government has extradited immigrants to a torture prison in a foreign country after lying to a judge, then falsely claimed it was helpless to get them back. Immigrants are now stacked in detention centers under already inhumane conditions that appear to be deteriorating. And in a brazen contravention of a principle ingrained in the American founding, the president and his aides have claimed the power to deploy active-duty troops in cities they allege have been overrun with migrants, crime, or homeless people—or merely those overseen by mayors or governors the administration dislikes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most alarmingly, the administration no longer feels obligated to even pretend that it’s observing norms and constitutional restrictions. “They just don’t care when judges or the public says they’re violating the law,” one longtime immigration judge, now retired, told me. “That’s unheard of in my lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I’ve spoken to and met with immigration attorneys and advocates all over the country. Many who openly spoke with me prior to the 2024 election are no longer willing to be quoted, fearing retaliation against their organizations or their funders, or even against them personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In more recent months, I’ve also interviewed former ICE and Customs and Border Protection officials, and former Immigration Court judges who served across multiple administrations of both parties. Career legal and law enforcement officials tend to be circumspect in their critiques of fellow law enforcement officers. They tend to avoid casual references to police states, or comparing U.S. police agencies to those in authoritarian countries. That’s no longer the case. These career police executives and prosecutors now use language I’ve rarely heard from current or former government officials in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing is a disgrace to policing,” said Reneé Hall, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE. Hall compares the tactics used by ICE and Border Protection officers to the worst abuses of the civil rights era. “We’ve made a lot of progress in policing,” she said. “They’ve wiped it out in months.… We’re back to letting police target people because of their skin color. We’re letting them kidnap people and take them to undisclosed locations. They’re barging into homes with no warrant. We saw them zip-tie young Black children—U.S. citizens—in Chicago. We’ve seen them use unnecessary force, slam people on the concrete. If I were just watching these incidents on television, I would think that we were not in the United States of America. Back then they wore hoods. Today they wear masks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m horrified by what I’ve seen,” said Chris Magnus, who served both as Joe Biden’s CBP commissioner and as police chief of Tucson, Fargo, and Richmond, California. “I wish the public had a better understanding of the harm they’re doing. Because it’s going to take a very long time to undo.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I wish I had something better to say than that it’s really bad,” another former senior Department of Justice official told me. “But it’s really fucking bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new federal budget Trump recently signed into law will triple the ICE budget and significantly increase the budgets both for Border Protection and for the construction of new detention centers. Trump’s deportation force will be larger than all but a handful of foreign militaries. According to the Brennan Center, the 2025 budget for immigration enforcement already exceeds that of every other federal law enforcement agency combined. And going forward, spending from the “Big Beautiful Bill” on immigration alone will exceed total spending by every state and local police agency in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if there’s one thing this administration has made clear, it’s this: What happened in Chicago will soon be happening in cities around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Government Lawyers Are Lying in Court&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the more maddening patterns playing out in the federal courts right now is the administration’s exploitation of a legal principle called “the presumption of regularity.” The legal doctrine instructs courts to presume that government lawyers argue in good faith and don’t deliberately misrepresent facts. The doctrine has rarely been a problem, because most administrations have argued in good faith, even when making bad arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This administration is different. As of this writing, in the months since Trump’s second inauguration, the site Just Security has documented more than 60 instances in which federal courts have ruled that Justice Department attorneys misrepresented the facts or the law. Some judges have done so with unusually frank language, including accusing the administration of outright lying. One judge wrote, “Trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of Trump’s power grabs are grounded in “emergency powers” exceptions that Congress or the courts have built into constitutional or statutory restraints on executive power. These powers have always been a glitch in the system. Dozens of emergencies declared with good intentions at the time have lingered over the years, as new administrations simply renew them without much oversight from Congress. Many concern sanctions against international figures involved in crime, drug smuggling, or weapons trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the current administration has exploited those exceptions like none before. Trump has declared nine new emergencies since January. His tariffs, for example, are based on a law allowing the president to temporarily impose tariffs in response to an emergency. But he has threatened and imposed tariffs for clearly illegal reasons, such as slapping sanctions on Brazil for prosecuting former President Jair Bolsonaro for an attempted coup, or on Canada for accurately using footage of former President Ronald Reagan in a TV commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The presumption of regularity and the enormous deference the Supreme Court demands courts show to the executive branch mean that any challenge to one of these declarations faces an uphill battle to prove that the administration is misrepresenting the facts or acting in bad faith in each individual case, even though it has shown an almost routine willingness to lie in other cases. And nowhere is this disconnect more striking than in Trump’s obsession with putting troops in American cities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using the Military as a Police Force&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The norm against using troops for routine law enforcement is one of America’s most important contributions to democratic governance. It’s a principle we came by honestly, from firsthand experience. Prior to the American Revolution, the British crown stationed soldiers in the streets of Boston to enforce tariffs and import taxes. The soldiers were armed with general warrants that gave them carte blanche to force their way into homes in search of contraband. The abuse of those powers sowed anger and ignited revolutionary fervor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lessons from Boston lingered after the Revolution and instilled in the Founders a deep distrust of standing armies. “A large standing Army in time of Peace hath ever been considered dangerous to the liberties of a Country,” George Washington wrote in 1783. Four years later, at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison cautioned, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After fierce debate, the Framers of the Constitution reluctantly concluded that the threats posed to the new republic still demanded an army at the ready. But to guard against abuses, they divided control of the military between the executive and legislative branches. Still, the fears about domestically deployed troops spilled into the Bill of Rights debates the following year. It’s why we have a Second Amendment (the purpose of the state militia “is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty,” Elbridge Gerry declared), as well as the Third Amendment protection against the forced quartering of soldiers, and the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This fear of domestically deployed troops has become ingrained in America’s DNA. Presidents have deployed active-duty troops within U.S. borders only sporadically, and almost always temporarily. The most common reason for doing so early in the republic was to put down labor uprisings, rebellions, and riots, and while there are legitimate reasons to question the motivations and propriety of those deployments, they were at least temporary and narrowly defined. The one exception was Reconstruction, which saw federal troops in Southern states for a decade. But that came after a bloody and destructive Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, one of the healthier and most encouraging characteristics of American democracy is that this norm has only become more robust over time. One big reason—also a sign of a healthy democracy—is that the principle has become ingrained in the military itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, for example, the Reagan administration wanted to deploy active-duty troops to fight the drug war on American streets. The plan was thwarted by opposition from the Pentagon. “One of [America’s] great strengths is that ... we do not allow the Army, Navy, and the Marines and Air Force to be a police force,” Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen Olmstead told Congress in 1989. “History is replete with countries that allowed that to happen. Disaster is the result.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to Trump’s deployment of 700 Marines in Los Angeles in June, no president had deployed active-duty troops to a U.S. city since the Los Angeles riots in 1992. And no president had deployed the military over the objections of a state governor since Dwight Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to desegregate Little Rock’s public schools in 1957.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deployment of National Guard troops is much more common. But that’s nearly always done by governors calling up their own Guard troops, sometimes to put down riots or protests, but more typically to aid with disaster response after hurricanes and tornadoes. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles is the first time a president has deployed the Guard over the objections of a state governor since 1965.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trump is a well-documented admirer of dictators and strongmen and has made clear that he harbors little reverence for this firewall between the military and domestic policing. In his first term, Trump wanted to deploy troops to put down the George Floyd protests, if possible by “shooting them in the legs.” He was thwarted by more levelheaded senior staff, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley. Trump and his second term advisers have made clear that they won’t tolerate that sort of dissent this time around. To fully implement his vision for the country, they’d need to purge the federal government of institutionalists and those who put democratic values and the rule of law over subservience to the president. As JD Vance put it in a 2021 podcast interview, “Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trump found his enforcer in Pete Hegseth, a man who is not only the least-qualified person ever nominated for secretary of defense, but whose record—which includes allegations of alcohol abuse and sexual assault and running two veterans’ nonprofits into the ground—should have been disqualifying. Trump really only had two prerequisites for the position. He wanted someone who loathed Pentagon institutionalists like Milley and Esper, and someone he could count on to be loyal. Here, Hegseth was more than qualified—embarrassingly so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hegseth has also echoed Trump’s contempt for the Pentagon’s healthier, democratically grounded principles. In his book, he has argued for enlisting the military in a modern-day crusade. And prior to 2025, other than his weekend co-hosting duties on Fox News, Hegseth was probably best known for lobbying Trump to pardon troops convicted of conscience-shocking war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After his confirmation, Hegseth dutifully began purging the Pentagon of its Milleys and Espers. He dismissed dozens of senior officials with centuries of experience (particularly those who weren’t male and weren’t white). Importantly, he also purged senior-level Judge Advocate General’s Corps, or JAG, officers, the attorneys who provide legal guidance on critical issues like rules of engagement or, say, the legality of deploying troops in U.S. cities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The administration has since been caught brazenly lying to federal courts to justify Trump’s military interventions. In Portland, Oregon, a Trump-appointed Federal District Court judge wrote that Trump and the DOJ’s claims that the city was “war ravaged” and “under siege” were “simply untethered to the facts.” The administration was later found to have vastly overstated to the court the number of federal officers it had sent to Portland to protect federal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Chicago, a federal judge rejected the administration’s claims that the city was under “coordinated assault” by unnamed “violent groups … actively aligned with designated domestic terror organizations.” The judge chided the administration for its “lack of candor,” which, she wrote, “calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” and noted a “troubling trend” of DOJ officials “equating protests with riots.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Creating a Secret Police Force&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most alarming images to emerge from the first year of Trump’s second term are those of immigration officers in balaclavas, gaiters, and ski masks stopping immigrants on sidewalks and demanding proof of citizenship, chasing day laborers and landscapers through parking lots and city streets, or emerging from unmarked vehicles, snatching people off the streets, then quickly carrying them away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those unmarked vehicles are often rented, and officers have been caught swapping out license plates to prevent themselves from being identified—or just not bothering with license plates at all. “The agency clearly wants to appear like a ghost,” one former Baltimore ICE official told NPR. “I have never experienced this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When law enforcement officers of any kind wear masks and withhold their identity, it smacks of tactics that are consistent with an authoritarian government,” said Magnus, the ex-police chief and former head of Border Patrol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve had police here for two centuries,” said George Pappas, an immigration judge whom Trump’s Justice Department fired in July. “They didn’t need masks. You use masks when you’re looking to carry out an illegal, extrajudicial operation. This is straight from the fascist playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The images and videos of masked agents have provoked alarm in law enforcement and legal communities. They’ve been criticized by groups ranging from the New York City Bar Association to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Even the FBI has asked DHS to remove the masks, pointing out that criminals have committed robberies and sexual assaults while impersonating immigration officers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But more to the point, masked secret police jumping out of vans to snatch people up and whisk them away isn’t supposed to happen in a free society. It’s the sort of thing we’ve cited to distinguish ourselves from military juntas or, more recently, from countries like Brazil or the Philippines, where masked officers have carried out horrific extrajudicial killings by the thousands. Or from Russia, where the spectacle of masked police carrying out illegal and undemocratic orders is common enough to have birthed the term “mask show.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those distinctions are getting harder and harder to make. Trump has lavished praise on the current and former authoritarian leaders of all three countries, often specifically for their despotism. He praised Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte explicitly for his drug war policies, which even then were known to include sending masked police teams to execute thousands of drug offenders. Because of those killings, Duterte is now facing trial at the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anya Bidwell heads up the Project on Immunity and Accountability for the Institute for Justice, a libertarian law firm. IJ is currently representing two U.S. citizens who were wrongly arrested and detained by immigration officers. “I was born in what was part of the Soviet Union at the time,” she said. “So seeing these kinds of things chills me to the bone. It brings bad memories.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHS officials have dismissed such comparisons as hysterical and hyperbolic. They say masking is necessary to prevent activists from “doxing” immigration officers and claim there has been an alarming surge in assaults on those officers. In June, they put the increase in assaults at 413 percent; by July, it was over 700 percent; and by October, it was over 1,000 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those figures are deceptive. The 2024 baseline figure against which the administration is making these calculations is 10, according to Fox News. That is, there were 10 alleged assaults on ICE officers between January and June 2024. There were 79 in 2025. Meanwhile, over the same period, the number of federal agents participating in deportations and removals has swelled from 6,000 to over 30,000. That puts the assault rate on federal immigration officials (0.23 per 100) exponentially lower than the assault rate on police officers more generally (13.5).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the ramped-up immigration enforcement and the exceptionally violent and aggressive tactics, we’d expect to see an increase in assaults on agents. More interactions, and more violent interactions, mean more opportunities for those interactions to escalate. We also know from surveillance and cell phone videos that agents have arrested and charged people with assault either on little evidence or for defending themselves when assaulted by police. After an ICE officer shot a Chicago woman named Marimar Martinez five times, for example, the administration claimed she had intentionally boxed agents in with her car and fired a gun at them. She was arrested and charged with assault. After that account was contradicted by witnesses and video, Martinez was released without charges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The mask issue really burns my biscuits,” said Reneé Hall. “I patrolled in the city of Detroit for nearly 20 years. I lived in the place that I policed. I didn’t get to hide my face. And you know what? Every other police officer across this country arresting people for drugs, for violent criminal acts, for gang violence, show their faces, too. My father was a police officer who was killed on duty. He never would have dreamed of hiding his face from the people he served. These federal officers are coming into these communities from other places, hiding their faces, using unnecessary force and violence, and then just walking away. That isn’t how it works. Hell no to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, of course, limited circumstances in which it may be justified for police officers to shield their identities—officers who investigate organized crime, for example, or who frequently work undercover. So there are no federal laws that prohibit it. But the most important reason U.S. police don’t wear masks isn’t grounded in the law, but in democratic values. “I find the masking absolutely fucking horrific,” said “Bryan,” a former high-ranking official in the DOJ. “It’s not something we do in a free society. It’s what they do under regimes we should never be emulating. It’s about intimidating and terrorizing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That shared understanding has broken down under an administration that seems to emulate those regimes, and that has made clear that it wants to instill fear and terror in immigrant communities. They aren’t letting federal immigration agents terrorize neighborhoods like Chicago’s Little Village because terrifying these places makes them safer. They’re doing it because they don’t believe neighborhoods like Little Village should exist. “The president’s goal is to create fear and anxiety,” said Michael Rodriguez, an alderman whose district includes the heavily Mexican American neighborhood. “It’s a sinister agenda to relitigate the Civil War. I don’t think that’s vitriol. This country is becoming majority minority, and they can’t handle that. So they’re turning to xenophobia to reverse the trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One needn’t look far to validate Rodriguez’s fears. Stephen Miller, who has been traipsing about the fever swamps of white nationalism for years, has made it no secret that he wants to reduce immigration from nonwhite countries to zero. Trump has echoed the sentiment, bemoaning at one point why so many immigrants come from “shithole countries” (the countries he’s named have all been predominantly Black and brown), and so few from countries like Norway or Switzerland. It’s now been widely reported that by the end of Trump’s second term, the bulk of the country’s refugee program will be redirected to aid white farmers from South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Placing Law Enforcement Above the Law&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic definition of a police state is a society in which the police themselves are above the law. In 2024, Donald Trump campaigned on promises to make police officers completely immune from both criminal prosecution and civil liability. Whether a president could actually do that isn’t as important as the fact that a major party’s nominee for president was, quite literally, promising to turn the country into a police state. And then he won.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States has long had a problem with holding bad cops accountable, and, to be fair, much of that problem predates Donald Trump. The George Floyd protests in 2020 provoked public discussion about qualified immunity, a legal doctrine wholly invented by the Supreme Court in 1967 that makes it extremely difficult to sue state and local police for abuses that violate the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less discussed is that it’s even more difficult—all but impossible, really—to sue federal law enforcement officers. For years, the only real avenue to do so was through the precedent set in the 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. But the court has been gradually chipping away at that case ever since and all but overturned it in 2022. There is one remaining, far more complicated law, the Federal Tort Claims Act, which lets people sue federal police officers, but to sue under that law is an immensely complicated process. The law also bars punitive damages, and it, too, is being eroded by the federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“People ask me questions like ‘Is it constitutional for them to wear masks?’ or ‘Can they really detain U.S. citizens incommunicado?’ or ‘Is it really legal for them to scare children like that?’” said Bidwell, the IJ attorney. “The answer is that it doesn’t matter if what they do is legal. Because they know that fundamentally they can’t be sued, either as the government itself or individually.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So while the administration sets arrest and deportation quotas, attacks immigrants with dehumanizing rhetoric, and tells immigration officers that they’ve been “unleashed,” Bidwell said, there’s nothing pushing back to keep deportation forces in line. “There’s no incentive for these officers to act in a cautious manner that’s compliant with the Constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Back when I worked for ICE, there would occasionally be times when they’d inadvertently arrest or detain an American citizen or legal resident,” said Javad Khazaeli, who was an immigration prosecutor during the Obama administration and now works as an immigration defense attorney. (Disclosure: Khazaeli is also a friend.) “When that happened, it would be all hands on deck. It was like, OK, what went wrong here and how do we fix it? Now there’s nothing like that. Now they just don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The immunity problem pervades the chain of command from top to bottom. Thanks to a spate of Supreme Court rulings from the case that all but killed Bivens, to rulings protecting political appointees for policy decisions, to the Supreme Court’s infamous ruling on presidential immunity, everyone is protected, from the Border Patrol officer who abandons a baby in the back seat of a car after detaining his immigrant parents (as happened in a suburb of Chicago) to the Border Patrol commander who tear-gasses elementary schools, to the president who says immigrants are “poisoning the blood of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That leaves only criminal liability. It seems unlikely that Trump’s DOJ would ever prosecute an immigration officer, even for egregious abuses. Some have suggested that local police and prosecutors arrest and charge Border Patrol agents caught committing clear crimes, or that states pass laws prohibiting masking by law enforcement, and then arrest officers who violate it. But state and local charges against federal police are almost always removed to federal court, at which point the Trump administration would presumably take over the prosecution and drop the charges. There may be some value in bringing charges anyway to force the issue and draw public attention to these abuses. But they aren’t likely to bring much accountability. It’s yet another policy that, while in place over multiple administrations, could be particularly destructive in the hands of an administration so averse to the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, this administration has exposed how the Supreme Court has made the Bill of Rights almost entirely reliant on the executive branch’s willingness to police itself. If federal police officers can violate constitutional rights with impunity, those rights may as well not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trump’s immigration agents are erasing accountability in other ways, too. They’re specifically targeting journalists who report on their actions. In Chicago, they tackled and arrested a WGN producer, claiming she threw something at ICE officers—an allegation that was disputed by witnesses. She was later released without charges. In June, the administration arrested an immigrant journalist in Georgia who had been reporting on immigration raids. At his deportation hearing, DOJ lawyers explicitly argued that his journalism was a threat to public safety. He has since been deported. In Los Angeles, immigration officers shot a citizen journalist who had built an online following for streaming ICE raids. They claim he rammed his vehicle into theirs. He was arrested for assaulting a federal officer. In Texas, another freelance journalist and DACA recipient had his status revoked and was arrested for “glorifying terrorism” over social media posts after he advocated at a city council meeting for a Muslim man who had recently been detained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after the raids on Home Depot parking lots and car washes began in L.A., civil and immigration rights groups filed a lawsuit accusing the administration of racially profiling Latino people. Notably, a federal judge ordered the government to stop, and arrests dropped dramatically. The Supreme Court eventually ordered a pause on that temporary restraining order, allowing raids and stops based on skin color, language, and presence in areas where immigrants live and work to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no majority opinion, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that people who are in the country illegally have no right not to be racially profiled. As for U.S. citizens or legal residents, Kavanaugh wrote, once immigration officials establish legal status, “they promptly let the individual go.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that Kavanaugh’s “concurrence improperly shifts the burden onto an entire class of citizens to carry enough documentation to prove that they deserve to walk freely.” It effectively made anyone who “looks immigrant” into a second-class citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh added that if immigration officers violate other rights of citizens or legal residents, such as by using excessive force or not “promptly letting that individual go,” those people could always sue. It had been just three years since Kavanaugh joined the majority in all but overturning Bivens, effectively shutting down the right to sue federal law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kavanaugh’s claim that citizens and legal residents would simply be “let go” hasn’t held up. About a month after the ruling on racial profiling, ProPublica published a report documenting 170 cases in which immigration officers had detained U.S. citizens. The publication found 130 cases in which U.S. citizens had been arrested for allegedly interfering with immigration operations or assaulting officers but were often never charged. It found over 20 cases in which U.S. citizens were held for more than a day without being permitted to contact an attorney or their families. “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents,” the publication wrote. “They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem watched.” More recently, immigration officers stopped a Latino U.S. citizen in Los Angeles during a raid on a Home Depot. They arrested the man for an alleged assault and weapons violation, then drove off in his vehicle with the man’s one-year-old daughter still in the back seat. All of this in just the first 10 months of the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This version of the Trump administration is a stress test for the United States,” said Bidwell. “They’re very good at identifying cracks in the system, then working at those cracks to widen them. These gaps in accountability for federal police have been around for a long time. We’re going to see how bad it can get when those gaps are exploited by an administration with no respect for constitutional restraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shredding Due Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a different world, immigration judges might be a check on all this abuse by immigration officers. But that isn’t the world we’re inhabiting. Despite their name, immigration courts have always operated within the executive branch, not the judicial, so they lack the independence of federal courts. Still, previous administrations mostly just tinkered with these courts at the margins, replacing judges as necessary with judges more in line with their policies. The Trump administration has changed all of that. Shortly after the inauguration, the DOJ issued memos to immigration judges making clear that they’d be expected to support the administration’s deportation goals. “There was a drastic change in tone,” Pappas said. “They were denigrating the people before us in terms of leadership, calling judges and leadership in the courts unethical and unprofessional.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following month, the firings began. Since February, DOJ has fired at least 98 immigration judges, and another 55 or so left voluntarily after seeing the writing on the wall. “Amanda” was one of the first judges fired in February. “I was never told why I was let go,” she said. “A lot of people were shocked. I don’t think anyone would have described me as a liberal judge. I’m a former immigration prosecutor. The feeling was that if they’d fire someone like me, no one was safe. Which is probably the message DOJ wanted to send.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amanda said there was one incident in her record, when she worked for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, that may have flagged Trump’s DOJ. “I was once reported for engaging in ‘illegal DEI,’” she said. “One of the individuals I supervised moved the seating arrangements for African American staff to the same undesirable hallway, causing staff to refer to that hall as ‘Jim Crow Row.’ I told her she had to stop doing that. When this new administration called for reporting of ‘illegal DEI,’ the staff member forwarded an email to me to notify me that she had reported me. Maybe that’s why I was fired. But my termination notice was a few sentences long. So who knows.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October, the DOJ announced that it would begin appointing military lawyers from the JAG Corps to serve as temporary immigration judges—the officers who had survived Hegseth’s purge. The move has been widely derided in the legal community as an effort to turn the courts into little more than a rubber stamp for the administration. “Immigration law is incredibly complicated,” Pappas said. “There’s just no way you’re going to be able to pick it up in a matter of weeks and treat these cases with the judgment and care they require.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most immediate effect of the administration’s politicization of immigration courts will be in denials of asylum claims and in expedited removal orders and deportations. “Immigration courts are like litigating death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” said Marks, the longtime immigration judge who retired in 2021. “When you deny asylum to someone, there’s a real possibility that person will turn up dead after they’re deported.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trump has also purged the board that hears immigration appeals and replaced those members with his own appointees. The new, Trump-friendly version of the board then announced that judges could no longer order bond for anyone in the country illegally. That decision—which has been roundly rejected when challenged in federal courts—potentially means millions more people in federal detention, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This, too, is all part of the plan. Miller, Tom Homan, and the architects of the child separation policy during Trump’s first term have made clear that one goal of their immigration policy is to disincentivize people from coming to the United States by inflicting suffering on those who do. One way to make people suffer is to take away their children. Another is to stuff them into overcrowded cells, deny them access to a shower, medication, and clean food and water, and make it all but impossible for them to contact their families or attorneys. Human rights groups have already documented these and other inhumane conditions at detention facilities all over the country, including at brand new centers like “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It Is Happening Here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Trump took office in January 2025, there were 39,000 people in ICE custody. By September, there were more than 60,000, and there will be capacity for around 107,000 by January 2026. As of this writing, 23 people have died this year in ICE custody. That’s the most since 2005, and more than the previous three years combined. The conditions faced by those in custody are only likely to get worse as deportation efforts continue to ramp up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the administration has hollowed out the offices within DHS and DOJ that oversee detention facilities. “There’s no oversight. There’s no reporting. There’s no access,” said “Dan,” a longtime former DHS employee and immigration prosecutor. “Until this administration, if a lawyer or an NGO complained about inhumane conditions, that was something we took very seriously. Now they just don’t care. It’s fully part of the plan. They’re open about it. You put people in detention, deny them access to a lawyer, and just continue to squeeze them until they’re so miserable that they give up their rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the midst of all of this, the Pentagon began engaging in this administration’s most egregious and brazen breach of due process to date: bombing boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, off the coasts of Colombia and Venezuela. The Pentagon claimed the occupants of the boats were “narco-terrorists,” but provided no evidence to support the accusation—nor would it be justified to kill them if they were. Smuggling drugs is not a capital crime in the United States. It also seems unlikely that most of the boats were bound for the United States, and neither Colombia nor Venezuela produces or exports significant quantities of fentanyl, the drug most responsible for overdose deaths in America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strikes are illegal, under both domestic and international law. The United States is not engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels, drug cartels are not terrorists or enemy combatants, and the administration has provided no evidence beyond its say-so that the people it has killed fit into any of those categories. The administration later conceded that it doesn’t actually know the identities of the people it is killing, but that it would be legally justified to kill anyone who is “as much as three hops away from a known member” of a designated terrorist organization. Setting aside the fact that, again, drug cartels are not terrorist groups, sociological studies estimate that the average person knows about 600 people. This means that under the “three-hop rule,” which allows authorities to pursue individuals three “hops” away from the target, each member of a terrorist group would make about 216 million people eligible for legal assassination by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of publication, the administration had killed more than 83 people in 21 strikes. The strikes embody Trump’s most authoritarian instincts—unchecked and unreviewable executive power; crass imperialism; a feverish, 1980s-era approach to illicit drugs (Trump has frequently said that drug dealers should be executed); and xenophobic bigotry, particularly toward the developing world. Both Trump and Vice President Vance have even joked about the possibility that the strikes may have killed innocent people, delivering wry bons mots about how Caribbean fishermen probably don’t go out on the water much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strikes are abominable, reckless acts of violence in and of themselves. But it isn’t difficult to envision how an administration with so little regard for law, human life, and due process might make the leap to think it can also carry out extrajudicial executions inside the United States, particularly one run by a president who equates criticism of him with treason, likens immigrants to vermin, and calls his opponents “the enemy within.” This, after all, is an administration already trying to legally define peaceful protesters and their supporters as “terrorists,” the same term it uses to justify those extrajudicial killings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There would certainly be far more popular and political backlash to such strikes within U.S. borders, or against U.S. citizens. But public opinion isn’t a dependable bulwark against an administration that has anointed itself judge, jury, and executioner. It’s of little comfort in the throes of an administration that believes it can kill on demand, regardless of domestic or international law, and feels no obligation to justify its decision to do so to Congress, the courts, or the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps that sounds overwrought. But if you had suggested in 2024 that if elected, the Republican candidate for president would instruct federal police to sweep immigrants off the street—some of whom were here legally, and most of whom had no prior criminal record—put them on airplanes, and send them to a Central American gulag, all without ever letting them speak to a judge, you’d also have been called overwrought. But it is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you had suggested 10 years ago that federal agencies would use Nazi, fascist, and white nationalist iconography and allude to explicitly white supremacist literature in their social media posts, or that the Department of Homeland Security would use nativist, blood-and-soil messaging about preserving Western heritage in its outreach to recruit new immigration officers, you’d also have been called overwrought. But this, too, is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you had suggested during the Obama era that a U.S. president would encourage a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol in order to prevent his successor from taking office, that said president would then be reelected, would pardon all of the insurrectionists, and then go about erasing that history from official records, you’d also have been called overwrought. But Trump has done all these things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the week I finished this story, a federal judge ruled that the conditions at the main immigration detention facility in Chicago were “inhumane.” U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman found that prisoners were being forced to sleep on top of one another, slept next to overflowing toilets, were provided with no beds or access to showers, didn’t have adequate food or medicine, and were forced to drink water that “tasted like sewer.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following day, in a separate lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis ruled that federal immigration officers in the city were using levels of force that “shocks the conscience.” She found that Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino and other government agents had lied to her in court proceedings. In an impassioned opinion, Ellis mounted an eloquent defense of both the city of Chicago and American values, quoting Carl Sandburg and John Adams. She also ruled that federal forces were deliberately undermining free speech by detaining and beating protesters. “The freedom of speech is a principal pillar in a free Government,” she wrote, quoting Benjamin Franklin, “when this support is taken away the Constitution is dissolved, and Tyranny is erected on its Ruins.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day, Bovino and his agents were back in Little Village, clashing with protesters. In the days that followed, they dragged a day care teacher out of her school as she screamed, used tear gas on large groups of protesters, and pepper-sprayed a one-year-old (they denied at least the pepper-spraying of the infant). Later, Bovino and his agents posed in front of Cloud Gate, the iconic sculpture more commonly called the Bean. According to local reports, the officers shouted out “Little Village!” as they mugged for a group selfie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a few days before Ellis’s ruling, in a prime-time interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, President Trump was asked if in tear-gassing entire neighborhoods, beating U.S. citizens, terrorizing children, and lying to federal courts—if given all of that—he thought that perhaps his deportation force in Chicago may have gone too far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He answered, “I don’t think they’ve gone far enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
