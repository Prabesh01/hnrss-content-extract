    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal of this tracker is to detect statistically significant degradations in Claude Code with Opus 4.5 performance on SWE tasks. We are an independent third party with no affiliation to frontier model providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Context: In September 2025, Anthropic published a postmortem on Claude degradations. We want to offer a resource to detect such degradations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We run a daily evaluation of Claude Code CLI on a curated, contamination-resistant subset of SWE-Bench-Pro. We always use the latest available Claude Code release and the SOTA model (currently Opus 4.5). Benchmarks run directly in Claude Code without custom harnesses, so results reflect what actual users can expect. This allows us to detect degradation related to both model changes and harness changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each daily evaluation runs on N=50 test instances, so daily variability is expected. Weekly and monthly results are aggregated for more reliable estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We model tests as Bernoulli random variables and compute 95% confidence intervals around daily, weekly, and monthly pass rates. Statistically significant differences in any of those time horizons are reported.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Project Genie: Experimenting with infinite, interactive worlds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, we previewed Genie 3, a general-purpose world model capable of generating diverse, interactive environments. Even in this early form, trusted testers were able to create an impressive range of fascinating worlds and experiences, and uncovered entirely new ways to use it. The next step is to broaden access through a dedicated, interactive prototype focused on immersive world creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, we're rolling out access to Project Genie for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S (18+). This experimental research prototype lets users create, explore and remix their own interactive worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we’re advancing world models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A world model simulates the dynamics of an environment, predicting how they evolve and how actions affect them. While Google DeepMind has a history of agents for specific environments like Chess or Go, building AGI requires systems that navigate the diversity of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge and support our AGI mission, we developed Genie 3. Unlike explorable experiences in static 3D snapshots, Genie 3 generates the path ahead in real time as you move and interact with the world. It simulates physics and interactions for dynamic worlds, while its breakthrough consistency enables the simulation of any real-world scenario — from robotics and modelling animation and fiction, to exploring locations and historical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on our model research with trusted testers from across industries and domains, we are taking the next step with an experimental research prototype: Project Genie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Project Genie works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project Genie is a prototype web app powered by Genie 3, Nano Banana Pro and Gemini, which allows users to experiment with the immersive experiences of our world model firsthand. The experience is centred on three core capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. World sketching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt with text and generated or uploaded images to create a living, expanding environment. Create your character, your world, and define how you want to explore it — from walking to riding, flying to driving, and anything beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more precise control, we have integrated “World Sketching” with Nano Banana Pro. This allows you to preview what your world will look like and modify your image to fine tune your world prior to jumping in. You can also define your perspective for the character — such as first-person or third-person — giving you control over how you experience the scene before you enter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. World exploration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your world is a navigable environment that’s waiting to be explored. As you move, Project Genie generates the path ahead in real time based on the actions you take. You can also adjust the camera as you traverse through the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. World remixing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remix existing worlds into new interpretations, by building on top of their prompts. You can also explore curated worlds in the gallery or in the &amp;lt;randomizer icon&amp;gt; for inspiration, or build on top of them. And once you’re done, you can download videos of your worlds and your explorations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we’re building responsibly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project Genie is an experimental research prototype in Google Labs, powered by Genie 3. As with all our work towards general AI systems, our mission is to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity. Since Genie 3 is an early research model, there are a few known areas for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generated worlds might not look completely true-to-life or always adhere closely to prompts or images, or real-world physics&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Characters can sometimes be less controllable, or experience higher latency in control&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Limitations in generations to 60 seconds&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few of the Genie 3 model capabilities we announced in August, such as promptable events that change the world as you explore it, are not yet included in this prototype. You can find more details on model limitations and future updates on how we’re improving the experience, here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on the work we have been doing with trusted testers, we are excited to share this prototype with users of our most advanced AI to better understand how people will use world models in many areas of both AI research and generative media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access to Project Genie begins rolling out today to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. (18+), expanding to more territories in due course. We look forward to seeing the infinitely diverse worlds they create, and in time, our goal is to make these experiences and technology accessible to more users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in eastern China, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports, and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 1.5-hour ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 7 a.m. the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood drawn in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek treated her differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on February 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What is causing high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot in March.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise, and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr. DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You are my best health adviser!” she praised it once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation~ 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing too!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced. I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models, chatbots are weaving themselves into seemingly every part of society in China, the U.S., and beyond. For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative. AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health therapists, and robot companions for the elderly. For the sick, the anxious, the isolated, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother was diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our hometown, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of 8 million people. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub and home to AlibabaAlibabaAlibaba, founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, is one of the most prominent global e-commerce companies that operates platforms like AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall.READ MORE — and, years later, would host DeepSeek.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our hometown, and visited only occasionally — my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked, and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s health care system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs, and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the hospitals are public, they largely operate as businesses, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meager salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown on medical corruption, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s health care system have gotten only more intense, and the system’s failures have led to widespread distrust of medical professionals. That has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our hometown. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes, and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, cycling between patients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When my mother was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series of medical ad scandals, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin, Zhihu, and XiaohongshuXiaohongshuXiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book” in Chinese, is a lifestyle e-commerce and social media platform.READ MORE for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who suffer from the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors have turned into influencers, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies, and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online, but like many other aging parents, she was stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large-language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023, determined that ChatGPT achieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Last year, Google said its fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark, while a specialized model trained on Meta’s Llama likewise excelled in medical exams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalizing to AI advocates. In one 2024 study, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least junior doctors in diagnosing eye problems, stomach symptoms, and emergency room cases. In June, Microsoft claimed it had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence.” Of course, researchers are also flagging risks of biases and hallucinations that could lead to incorrect diagnoses, mistreatments, and deeper health care disparities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their U.S. counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities. It has performed well on medical tests too. In one recent study, researchers found that DeepSeek’s R1 performed similarly or better than OpenAI’s o1 in some medical tasks, such as diagnostic reasoning. Meanwhile, it lagged behind in others, such as evaluating radiology reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ignoring some of the limitations, users in the U.S. and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults said they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a 2024 survey by health research firm KFF. On Reddit, users shared story after story of ChatGPT diagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people also reported consulting chatbots for treatments for themselves, their children, and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An electronics factory worker in Jiangsu province, who declined to be named for privacy reasons, told me he consulted three different chatbots after his mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer, just to check if her doctor was right in telling her not to worry. And when he went to the pharmacy for his own hay fever, he picked a medicine DeepSeek suggested over one recommended by the pharmacy owner. “[Owners] always recommend the most expensive ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real Kuang, a photographer in the city of Chengdu, asks DeepSeek about her parents’ health issues: how to treat her father’s throat inflammation, whether they should take calcium supplements, if her mother should get shoulder surgery. “Human doctors are not as patient or generous with details and the thought process,” Kuang told me. “DeepSeek made us feel more cared for.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in the office of Dr. DeepSeek, she is at ease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements, and medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analyzed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks, and offered portion recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, like wintermelon soup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. My weight is 39.5 kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyze the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables, and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You are not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m so happy with your improvement!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother’s reliance on DeepSeek grew over the months. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid sitting while leaning forward, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two U.S.-based nephrologists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr. Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anemia — using a hormone called erythropoietin — could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary, or a “kind of fantasy,” Topf told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know –– it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy, and clinical judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a study published in Nature Medicine earlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialties. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told Rest of World that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people treat it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another study led by researchers at Oxford University, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, members of the general public were asked to identify health conditions and a subsequent course of action using either large language models or conventional methods, such as search engines and checking the National Health Service website. Those who used LLMs did not do any better in reaching the correct answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford and the lead author of the study, told me that during the experiment, users omitted important symptoms in their prompts or failed to identify the correct answer when the chatbot suggested a few different options. Large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As my mother bonded with DeepSeek, health care providers across China embraced large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the release of DeepSeek R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts, and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialized models. One hospital in Sichuan province introduced “DeepJoint,” a model for orthopaedics that analyzes CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijing developed “Stone Chat AI,” which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tech industry now views health care as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself has begun recruiting interns to annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibaba announced in May that its health care–focused chatbot, trained on top of its Qwen models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder Wang Xiaochuan told a Chinese outlet. Baichuan AI declined my interview request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay also offers a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI pediatricians, AI urologists, and an AI insomnia specialist who would be available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3 a.m. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports, and help users book appointments with real doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tian Jishun, a gynecologist in Hangzhou, agreed to lend his persona to Alipay as the company built up its fleet of 200 AI doctors. Tian told me he wanted to be part of the AI revolution, although he admits his digital counterpart is lacking. “It’s like the first iPhone,” he told me. “You never know what the future will be like.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zhang Chao, founder of AI health care startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has banned “AI doctors” from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was overall confident with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests, and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in health care access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff, and the rural–urban gap in quality care. Chinese media have reported on AI assisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas like the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better health care and education, thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His study, recently published in the Journal of Health Economics, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specialty. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability, and biases that could actually exacerbate health care disparities. In one study published in Science Advances in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyze chest X-rays and discovered that, compared to human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalized groups, such as females, Black patients, and those younger than 40.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&amp;amp;M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai … might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I called my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek — about English grammar — to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My one-child policy generation has grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure has yet to catch up, but many of us now live far away from our aging parents and are busy navigating our own adulthood challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that — leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington, D.C., who also immigrated from China, recently discovered her own mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, suffers from depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zhang Jiansheng, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, created an AI-powered tablet that can speak to people with Alzheimer’s disease. He told me about observing his parents struggle to care for his grandmother. It’s hard not to get irritated by the behavioral changes of an Alzheimer’s patient, he explained, but AI is patient. “AI has no emotions,” he said. “It will keep offering encouragement, praise, and comfort to the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our hometown showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8 p.m. and her 8 a.m. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr. DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46814569</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>PlayStation 2 Recompilation Project Is Absolutely Incredible</title><link>https://redgamingtech.com/playstation-2-recompilation-project-is-absolutely-incredible/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="87bf58572a279dff"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PlayStation 2’s library is easily among the best of any console ever released, and even if you were to narrow down the list of games to the very best, you’d be left with dozens (more like hundreds) of incredible titles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the PS2 hardware is getting a bit long in the tooth, and even though you can hook up the console using RGB component cables to a great upscaler (or use other means) to get the best visuals on a modern 4k TV, emulators have grown in popularity with PCSX2 offering gamers means to scale titles to render internally at higher resolutions, run with a more stable frame rate and, even make use of texture packs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But do you know what’s better than an emulator? Taking the existing Playstation 2 game and recompiling it to run on a modern platform (such as your Windows or Linux desktop PC). That’s exactly what is being worked on now with PS2Recomp, a static Recompiler &amp;amp; Runtime Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things simple here, this will basically take a Playstation 2 game (which would be designed around the PS2’s unique architecture such as the ‘Emotion Engine’ CPU that’s based around a MIP R5900) and convert it to natively run on whatever platform you’re targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In plain English, this is a tool and obviously, would need to be used on different games. In other words, it’s not just a ‘download and every game automatically runs’ application. But, it will give folks a tool to be able to decompile the game and quite frankly, that’s absolutely incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a great stepping stone for some incredible remasters and community remakes of games. There are already HD Texture Packs available for PS2 emulators, as well as other ways to improve visuals. But this would give even more freedom and flexibility to do modify and really enhance the games. That’s to say nothing of totally unlocking the frame rates (and likely not breaking physics or collision detection which is a big problem with emulated titles).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a guess, too, the games would also run great even with much lower-end hardware than would be needed for emulators. Recompilation efforts in the community certainly aren’t new. Indeed, you can look to the N64 because there have been several high-profile examples of what these kind of projects can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few infamous ones would include both including Mario 64 and Zelda. Indeed, there’s a fork of the Mario 64 project supporting RTX (ray tracing) for Nvidia owners. You can see an example of Mario 64 below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example on the N64 is Zelda, where the project has a plethora of visual and gameplay enhancements, and in the longer term again, they’re planning to introduce Ray Tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, in the future we could be playing the likes of MGS2, Gran Turismo, God of War, Tekken 4, Shadow Hearts with ‘native’ PC versions. This would allow controllers to run (such as dual shock or Xbox controllers) and other features to be bundled in too (exactly as we see with the N64 ports).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, currently playing PS2 games on PC via emulator is still absolutely fantastic, but native ports would be the holy grail of game preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Playstation 2 architecture is extremely unique, and as I mentioned earlier in this article focused around a MIPS R5900 based CPU known as the Emotion Engine (operating a shade under 300MHz). This CPU was super unique, because Sony implemented a number of customized features include two Vector Units designed to help manipulate geometry and perform a bunch of other co-processing duties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was bundled with 32MB of memory, and the GPU was known as the Graphics Synthesizer, runing at about 147MHz, and sporting 4MB of embedded DRAM. Sony’s design was fascinating for the time, and despite its processor clocked significantly lower than either Nintendo’s GameCube or Microsoft’s Xbox, punched well above its weight class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a small update – I want to remind people that (as of the time I’m writing this article) the project is *NOT* finished yet, and there is still work to do. But the fact that this is being worked on is awesome for those of us interested in game preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Executing the command &lt;code&gt;flameshot&lt;/code&gt; without parameters will launch a running
instance of the program in the background without taking actions.
If your desktop environment provides tray area, a tray icon will also
appear in the tray for users to perform configuration and management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example commands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Capture with GUI:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;flameshot gui&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Capture with GUI with custom save path:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;flameshot gui -p ~/myStuff/captures&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Capture with GUI after 2 seconds delay (can be useful to take screenshots of mouse hover tooltips, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;flameshot gui -d 2000&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fullscreen capture with custom save path (no GUI) and delayed:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;flameshot full -p ~/myStuff/captures -d 5000&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fullscreen capture with custom save path copying to clipboard:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;flameshot full -c -p ~/myStuff/captures&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Capture the screen containing the mouse and print the image (bytes) in PNG format:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;flameshot screen -r&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Capture the screen number 1 and copy it to the clipboard:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;flameshot screen -n 1 -c&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case of doubt choose the first or the second command as shortcut in your favorite desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A systray icon will be in your system's panel while Flameshot is running. Do a right click on the tray icon and you'll see some menu items to open the configuration window and the information window. Check out the About window to see all available shortcuts in the graphical capture mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Windows, &lt;code&gt;flameshot.exe&lt;/code&gt; will behave as expected for all supported command-line arguments,
but it will not output any text to the console. This is problematic if, for example, you are
running &lt;code&gt;flameshot.exe -h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you require console output, run &lt;code&gt;flameshot-cli.exe&lt;/code&gt; instead. &lt;code&gt;flameshot-cli.exe&lt;/code&gt; is a minimal wrapper around &lt;code&gt;flameshot.exe&lt;/code&gt; that ensures all stdout is captured and output to the console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use the graphical menu to configure Flameshot, but alternatively you can use your terminal or scripts to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Open the configuration menu:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;flameshot config&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Show the initial help message in the capture mode:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;flameshot config --showhelp true&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For more information about the available options use the help flag:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;flameshot config -h&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also edit some of the settings (like overriding the default colors) in the configuration file.&lt;lb/&gt; Linux path: &lt;code&gt;~/.config/flameshot/flameshot.ini&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt; Windows path: &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\{YOURNAME}\AppData\Roaming\flameshot\flameshot.ini&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When copying over the config file from Linux to Windows or vice versa, make sure to correct the &lt;code&gt;savePath&lt;/code&gt; variable,&lt;lb/&gt; so that the screenshots save in the right directory on your desired file system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These shortcuts are available in GUI mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Keys&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;P&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set the Pencil as paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set the Line as paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set the Arrow as paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;S&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set Selection as paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;R&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set the Rectangle as paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;C&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set the Circle as paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;M&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set the Marker as paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;T&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Add text to your capture&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;B&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set Pixelate as the paint tool&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;←, ↓, ↑, →&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Move selection 1px&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Shift + ←, ↓, ↑, →&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Resize selection 1px&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + Shift + ←, ↓, ↑, →&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Symmetrically resize selection 2px&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Esc&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Quit capture&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + M&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Move the selection area&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + C&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Copy to clipboard&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + S&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Save selection as a file&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + Z&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Undo the last modification&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + Shift + Z&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + Q&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Change the tool's thickness&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Print screen&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Capture Screen&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Shift + Print&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Screenshot History&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + drawing line, arrow or marker&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Drawing only horizontally, vertically or diagonally&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + drawing rectangle or circle&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Keeping aspect ratio&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shift + drag a handler of the selection area: mirror redimension in the opposite handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flameshot uses Print screen (Windows) and cmd-shift-x (macOS) as default global hotkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Linux, Flameshot doesn't yet support Prt Sc out of the box, but with a bit of configuration you can set this up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make configuration easier, there's a file in the repository that more or less automates this process. This file will assign the following hotkeys by default:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Keys&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Prt Sc&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Start the Flameshot screenshot tool and take a screenshot&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + Prt Sc&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Wait for 3 seconds, then start the Flameshot screenshot tool and take a screenshot&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Shift + Prt Sc&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Take a full-screen (all monitors) screenshot and save it&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ctrl + Shift + Prt Sc&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Take a full-screen (all monitors) screenshot and copy it to the clipboard&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don't like the defaults, they can be changed later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps for using the configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The configuration file makes Flameshot automatically save screenshots to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/Pictures/Screenshots&lt;/code&gt;without opening the save dialog. Make sure that folder exists by running:&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Screenshots&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;(If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Download the configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;cd ~/Desktop wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde.khotkeys&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;khotkeys&lt;/code&gt;installed using your package manager to enable custom shortcuts in KDE Plasma.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Go to System Settings → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If an entry exists for Spectacle (the default KDE screenshot utility), you'll need to disable it because its shortcuts might conflict with Flameshot's. Do this by unchecking the Spectacle entry.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Click Edit → Import..., navigate to the configuration file and open it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now the Flameshot entry should appear in the list. Click Apply to apply the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to change the default hotkeys, you can expand the entry, select the appropriate action and modify it as you wish; the process is pretty self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you installed Flameshot as a Flatpak, you will need to create a symlink to the command:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/org.flameshot.Flameshot ~/.local/bin/flameshot&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use Flameshot instead of the default screenshot application in Gnome we need to remove the binding on Prt Sc key, and then create a new binding for &lt;code&gt;flameshot gui&lt;/code&gt; (adapted from Pavel's answer on AskUbuntu).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remove the binding on Prt Sc:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; View and Customise Shortcuts &amp;gt; Screenshots &amp;gt; Take a screenshot interactively and press&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;backspace&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add custom binding on Prt Sc:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Keyboard &amp;gt; View and Customise Shortcuts &amp;gt; Custom shortcuts and press the '+' button at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name the command as you like it, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;flameshot&lt;/code&gt;. And in the command insert&lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/flameshot gui&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;flatpak run org.flameshot.Flameshot gui&lt;/code&gt;if installed via flatpak.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then click "Set Shortcut.." and press Prt Sc. This will show as "print".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now every time you press Prt Sc, it will start the Flameshot GUI instead of the default application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Keyboard&lt;/code&gt;settings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Switch to the tab&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Application Shortcuts&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Find the entry&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Command Shortcut xfce4-screenshooter -fd 1 Print&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xfce4-screenshooter -fd 1&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;flameshot gui&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now every time you press Prt Sc it will start Flameshot GUI instead of the default application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit your&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.fluxbox/keys&lt;/code&gt;file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a new entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Print&lt;/code&gt;is the key name,&lt;code&gt;flameshot gui&lt;/code&gt;is the shell command; for more options see the fluxbox wiki.&lt;code&gt;Print :Exec flameshot gui&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Refresh Fluxbox configuration with Reconfigure option from the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Experimental Gnome Wayland and Plasma Wayland support.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are using Gnome you need to install the AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support extension in order to see the system tray icon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Press Enter or Ctrl + C when you are in a capture mode and you don't have an active selection and the whole desktop will be copied to your clipboard. Pressing Ctrl + S will save your capture to a file. Check the Shortcuts for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Flameshot works best with a desktop environment that includes D-Bus. See this article for tips on using Flameshot in a minimal window manager (dwm, i3, xmonad, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In order to speed up the first launch of Flameshot (D-Bus init of the app can be slow), consider starting the application automatically on boot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Quick tip: If you don't have Flameshot to autostart at boot and you want to set keyboard shortcut, use the following as the command for the keybinding:&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;( flameshot &amp;amp;; ) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ( sleep 0.5s &amp;amp;&amp;amp; flameshot gui )&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flameshot can be installed on Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some prebuilt packages are provided on the release page of the GitHub project repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are packages available in the repository of some Linux distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arch: &lt;code&gt;pacman -S flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Snapshot also available via AUR: flameshot-git.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian 10+: &lt;code&gt;apt install flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Package for Debian 9 ("Stretch") also available via stretch-backports.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ubuntu: &lt;code&gt;apt install flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;openSUSE: &lt;code&gt;zypper install flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Void Linux: &lt;code&gt;xbps-install flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solus: &lt;code&gt;eopkg it flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fedora: &lt;code&gt;dnf install flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NixOS: &lt;code&gt;nix-env -iA nixos.flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ALT: &lt;code&gt;su - -c "apt-get install flameshot"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snap/Flatpak/AppImage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Docker&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MacPorts: &lt;code&gt;sudo port selfupdate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo port install flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Homebrew: &lt;code&gt;brew install --cask flameshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that because of macOS security features, you may not be able to open flameshot when installed using brew. If you see the message &lt;code&gt;“flameshot” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.&lt;/code&gt; you will need to
follow the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to the Applications folder (Finder &amp;gt; Go &amp;gt; Applications, or Shift+Command+A)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Right-Click on "flameshot.app" and choose "Open" from the context menu&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the dialog click "Open"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On MacOs 15 and above, you will have to go to system settings -&amp;gt; privacy and security after doing this and click "Open Anyway" or you can open flameshot first time with the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/flameshot.app&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After following all those steps above, &lt;code&gt;flameshot&lt;/code&gt; will open without problems in your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that for the Flameshot icon to appear in your tray area, you should have a systray software installed. This is especially true for users who use minimal window managers such as dwm. In some Desktop Environment installations (e.g Gnome), the systray might be missing and you can install an application or plugin (e.g Gnome shell extension) to add the systray to your setup. It has been reported) that icon of some software, including Flameshot, does not show in gnome-shell-extension-appindicator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, in case you don't want to have a systray, you can always call Flameshot from the terminal. See Usage section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build the application in your system, you'll need to install the dependencies needed for it and package names might be different for each distribution, see Dependencies below for more information. You can also install most of the Qt dependencies via their installer. If you were developing Qt apps before, you probably already have them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project uses CMake build system, so you need to install it in order to build the project (on most Linux distributions it is available in the standard repositories as a package called &lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt;). If your distribution provides too old version of CMake (e.g. Ubuntu or Debian) you can download it on the official website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also you can open and build/debug the project in a C++ IDE. For example, in Qt Creator you should be able to simply open &lt;code&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;Open File or Project&lt;/code&gt; in the menu after installing CMake into your system. More information about CMake projects in Qt Creator.&lt;/p&gt;

# With flakes:
nix develop&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Build flameshot
nix build

# Build and run flameshot
nix run&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all you need to install brew and then install the dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;brew install qt6
brew install cmake&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After installing all the dependencies, Flameshot can be built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the translations to be loaded correctly, the build process needs to be aware of where you want to install Flameshot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Directory where build files will be placed, may be relative
export BUILD_DIR=build

# Directory prefix where Flameshot will be installed. If you are just building and don't want to
# install, comment this environment variable.
# This excludes the bin/flameshot part of the install,
# e.g. in /opt/flameshot/bin/flameshot, the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /opt/flameshot
# This must be an absolute path. Requires CMAKE 3.29.
export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/flameshot

# Linux
cmake -S . -B "$BUILD_DIR" \
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cmake --build "$BUILD_DIR"

#MacOS
cmake -S . -B "$BUILD_DIR" \
    -DQt6_DIR="$(brew --prefix qt6)/lib/cmake/Qt6" \
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cmake --build "$BUILD_DIR"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;cmake --build&lt;/code&gt; command has completed you can launch Flameshot from the &lt;code&gt;project_folder/build/src&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that if you install from source, there is no uninstaller, so consider installing to a custom directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure you are using cmake &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 3.29&lt;/code&gt; and build Flameshot with &lt;code&gt;$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX&lt;/code&gt; set to the
installation directory. If this is not done, the translations won't be found when using a custom directory.
Then, run the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# !Build with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and use cmake &amp;gt;= 3.29! Using an older cmake will cause
# installation into the default /usr/local dir.

# You may need to run this with privileges
cmake --install "$BUILD_DIR"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# You may need to run this with privileges
cmake --install "$BUILD_DIR"&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy April 1st! This post is part of April Cools Club: an April 1st effort to publish genuine essays on unexpected topics. Please enjoy this true story, and rest assured that the tech content will be back soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what my dad said when I asked what was wrong with our home internet connection. "The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's back up a few steps, so we're all on the same page about the utter ridiculousness of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was still a college student — this was over 10 years ago. I had come back home to spend a couple of weeks with my parents before the fall semester kicked off. I hadn't been back home in almost a full year, because home and school were on different continents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My dad is an engineer who had already been tinkering with networking gear longer than I'd been alive. Through the company he started, he had designed and deployed all sorts of complex network systems at institutions across the country — everything from gigabit Ethernet for an office building, to inter-city connections over line-of-sight microwave links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is the last person on Earth who would say a "magical thinking" phrase like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"What?" I uttered, stunned. "The Wi-Fi only works while it's raining," he repeated patiently. "It started a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't had a chance to look into it yet."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"No way," I said. If anything, rain makes wireless signal quality worse, not better. Never better!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two weeks without reliable internet? I started a speed-run through the stages of grief...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Denial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I pulled open my laptop and started poking at the network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pinging any website had a 98% packet loss rate. The internet connection was still up, but only in the most annoying "technically accurate" sense. Nothing loads when you have a 98% packet loss rate! The network may as well have been dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was upset. I had just started dating someone a few months prior, and she was currently on the other side of the planet! How was I to explain that I couldn't stay in touch because it wasn't raining? Mobile data at the time was exorbitantly expensive, so much so that I didn't have a data plan at all for my cell service at home. I couldn't just use my phone's data plan to work around the problem, like one might do today in a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was pacing around the house, fuming. Grief, stage two!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's when the rain started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bargaining&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like a miracle, within 5 minutes of the rain starting, the packet loss rate was down to 0%!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I couldn't believe my eyes! I was ready for the connection to die at any second, so I opened a million tabs at once — as if I don't normally do that anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rain held up for about an hour, and so did the internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, 15 minutes or so after the rain stopped, the packet loss rate shot back up to 90%+. The internet connection went back to being unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was ready to do just about anything to get more rain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the weather stayed grey and murky for the next few days. Each time, the pattern stayed the same:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The rain starts, and not even a few minutes later the internet connection is crisp and fast.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The rain stops, and within 15 minutes the internet connection is unusable again.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As much as I hated to admit it, the evidence was solid. The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I had a choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could keep going through the stages of grief: I could sulk and plan my calls with my girlfriend around the weather forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, I could break out of that downward spiral and get to the bottom of what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Magical thinking be damned! Am I an engineer or what?" I told myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That settled it. I wasn't going to take this lying down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Determination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some context on our home networking setup is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember how my dad's company had extensive experience with networking solutions? Well, we had a fancy networking setup at home too — and it had worked flawlessly for the best part of 10 years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My dad's office had a very expensive, very fast For the time, of course. commercial internet connection. The home internet options, meanwhile, weren't great! In my family, we are often stubbornly against settling for less unless there's absolutely no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The office and our apartment were a few blocks away from each other along a small hill, with our second-floor apartment holding the higher ground. With a bit of work, my dad set up a line-of-sight Wi-Fi bridge — a couple of high-gain directional Wi-Fi antennas pointed at each other — between the office and our apartment. This let us enjoy the faster commercial internet connection at home!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started poking around the network to figure out where the connection was breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The local Wi-Fi router at home was working well — no packets lost. The local end of the Wi-Fi bridge was fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But pinging the remote end of the Wi-Fi bridge was showing a 90%+ packet loss rate — and so did pinging any other network device behind it. Aha, there's something wrong with the Wi-Fi bridge!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what? And why now, when the system had been working fine for almost 10 years, rain or shine? Maybe years of work experience isn't a good metric here either 😄&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can a rain storm fix a Wi-Fi bridge, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So many confusing questions. Time to get some answers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Debugging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like any experienced engineer, the first thing I tried was turning everything off and then on again. It didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I checked all the devices on the network individually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe one of the devices has gone bad with age? Nope. I physically connected my laptop to each device's local Ethernet, then ran diagnostics, pinged the devices over the wired connection, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe a cable got unseated or came loose? Nope.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe a power brick has become faulty over time? Nope.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe an automatic firmware update failed and broke something? Nope.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe an antenna connector has corroded from spending years outdoors? Nope.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike debugging software, a lot of this hardware debugging was annoyingly physical. I had to climb up ladders, trace cables that hadn't been touched in 10 years, and do a lot of walking back and forth between our home and my dad's office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On my umpteenth back-and-forth walk, as I was bored and exasperated, I started noticing how much our neighborhood had changed in the many years I hadn't been living at home full-time. Before college, I spent four years at a boarding high school. I was on our national math and programming teams for the IMO and IOI), so I even spent most of each summer away from home at prep camps and at the competitions themselves. Many of the little neighborhood shops were new. Many houses had gotten a fresh coat of paint. Trees that used to be barely more than saplings had grown tall and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then it hit me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Realization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran home and climbed up onto the scaffolding holding up the Wi-Fi bridge's antenna. I was hanging precariously off the side of our apartment building, two stories up in the air. In retrospect, a safety harness would have been a good idea... Things people do for internet! Don't forget, a girl was involved too — I wasn't doing this merely for Netflix or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I looked downhill, at the antenna that formed the second half of the Wi-Fi bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or at least, toward the antenna, because I couldn't see it — a tree in a neighbor's yard was in the way! Its topmost branches were swaying back and forth in the line-of-sight between the antenna pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Problem and the Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many years ago, we installed the Wi-Fi bridge. For a long time, everything was great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But every year, our neighbor's tree grew taller and taller. Shortly before when I came back home that summer, its topmost branches had managed to reach high enough to interfere with our Wi-Fi signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was only barely tall enough to interfere with the signal, though!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time it rained, the rain collected on its leaves and branches and weighed them down. The extra weight bent them out of the way of the Wi-Fi line-of-sight! Interestingly, objects outside the straight line between antennas can still cause interference! For best signal quality, the Fresnel zone between the antennas should be clear of obstructions. But perfection isn't achievable in practice, so RF equipment like Wi-Fi uses techniques like error-correcting codes so that it can still work without a perfectly clear Fresnel zone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each time the rain stopped, the rainwater would continue to drip off the tree. Slowly, over the course of 15ish minutes, that would unburden the tree — letting it rise back up into the path of our bits and bytes. That's when the Wi-Fi would stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix was easy: upgrade our hardware. We replaced our old 802.11g devices with new 802.11n ones, which took advantage of new &lt;del&gt;magic&lt;/del&gt; math and physics to make signals more resistant to interference. One such piece of magic new to 802.11n Wi-Fi is called "beamforming" — it's when a transmitter can use multiple antennas transmitting on the same frequency to shape and steer the signal in a way that improves the effective range and signal quality. Modern Wi-Fi does beamforming with only a few antenna elements, but if we scale that number way up we get a phased array antenna. Ever wondered how come Starlink antennas are flat and not a "dish" like old satellite TV antennas? They use phased arrays to aim their signal at the Starlink satellites streaking across the sky — without any moving parts. &lt;del&gt;Magic!&lt;/del&gt; Physics! &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days later, the new gear arrived and I eagerly climbed back up the scaffolding to install the new antennas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few screws, zip ties, and cable connections later, the Wi-Fi's "link established" lights flashed green once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, it wasn't raining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All was well once again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Retiring GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini in ChatGPT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On February 13, 2026, alongside the previously announced retirement of GPT‑5 (Instant and Thinking), we will retire GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini from ChatGPT. In the API, there are no changes at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this announcement applies to several older models, GPT‑4o deserves special context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After we first deprecated it and later restored access during the GPT‑5 release, we learned more about how people actually use it day to day. We brought GPT‑4o back after hearing clear feedback from a subset of Plus and Pro users, who told us they needed more time to transition key use cases, like creative ideation, and that they preferred GPT‑4o’s conversational style and warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That feedback directly shaped GPT‑5.1 and GPT‑5.2, with improvements to personality, stronger support for creative ideation, and more ways to customize how ChatGPT responds(opens in a new window). You can choose from base styles and tones like Friendly, and controls for things like warmth and enthusiasm. Our goal is to give people more control and customization over how ChatGPT feels to use—not just what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re announcing the upcoming retirement of GPT‑4o today because these improvements are now in place, and because the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1% of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More broadly, we’re continuing to improve ChatGPT across areas users have told us need work. This includes further improvements to personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses, with updates coming soon. We’re continuing to make progress toward a version of ChatGPT designed for adults over 18, grounded in the principle of treating adults like adults, and expanding user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards. To support this, we’ve rolled out age prediction(opens in a new window) for users under 18 in most markets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes like this take time to adjust to, and we’ll always be clear about what’s changing and when. We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn’t make this decision lightly. Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if your car worked like so many apps? You’re driving somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the road and asks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How are you enjoying your drive so far?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minute later it does it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It blocks your speedometer with an overlay tutorial about the turn signal. It highlights the wiper controls and refuses to go away until you demonstrate mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ridiculous, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, this is how a lot of modern software behaves. Not because it’s broken, but because we’ve normalized an interruption model that would be unacceptable almost anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve started to think of this as backseat software: the slow shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel that operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it’s remarkably hard to keep it quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is about how we got here. Not overnight, but slowly. One reasonable step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software Came on Disks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a time when software shipped on physical media: floppy disks, CD-ROMs, sometimes even with a spiral-bound manual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software felt like a product back then. You bought it, installed it, and used it. If you upgraded, it was because you chose to. The software didn’t constantly change underneath you, and it didn’t have the opportunity to ask for your attention beyond whatever UI the developers shipped on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That era had real downsides. If you shipped a serious bug, you lived with it until the next release, which could be weeks or months away. If security issues were discovered, your options ranged from “mail a patch” to “good luck.” In hindsight, it’s amazing we survived!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But something else was true too. When you were using the software, you were alone with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a software developer, if something was wrong, you found out because users told you. Sometimes loudly. Sometimes angrily. Often on message forums or during support calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feedback was slower and scarcer, but it was real. It was also “expensive” in the way that matters. You had to earn it, listen to it, and interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Always Online&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the internet arrived, and for a while it was almost entirely upside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software could finally be updated after it shipped. Bugs could be fixed. Security holes could be closed. Documentation got easier. Support got easier. The idea of “ship it and hope for the best” started to fade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s update infrastructure is a good example of the era. Updates moved from “go download this” toward automation over time, and by the early 2000s the industry was normalizing the idea that your machine could check for and apply updates regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a genuine leap forward in quality and safety. If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a serious bug report, you know how valuable it is to fix something now rather than in the next boxed release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Back Channel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once software could reliably connect to the internet, it no longer just received instructions. It could talk back to the company that made it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, this too was mostly good. Crash reports made it easier to fix real problems, update checks were convenient, and license activation reduced some kinds of piracy. Teams could finally see patterns in failure modes instead of guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers like me love this kind of feedback loop, and for good reason. A tool that improves over time is better than one that doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that back channel didn’t stay limited to “this crashed” and “there’s an update.” It expanded, quietly, because once you can send some data home, the next question arrives right on schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Since we’re already connected…what else can we learn?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everything Gets Measured&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once software could send data home, the next natural thought was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Can we understand how people actually use this?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, that’s not an evil thought. In fact, it’s useful! Before analytics, if you wanted to understand user behavior, you had to ask people, watch them, or infer patterns from support tickets. That requires time, empathy, and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, you didn’t have to guess anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web analytics going mainstream is one of those quiet accelerants. Google’s acquisition of Urchin in 2005, and the rise of Google Analytics shortly after, helped normalize the idea that instrumentation and dashboards were simply part of building software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of arguing in a meeting about which features mattered most, you could look at usage data. Instead of guessing where people struggled, you could see drop-offs. Instead of relying on the loudest customer, you could get a broader view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But somewhere along the way, the center of gravity shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage data stopped being a tool for improving software and became a tool for optimizing behavior. The question quietly changed from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Is this good software?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Does this increase engagement?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s when the vocabulary starts to creep in. DAU. MAU. Retention. Funnels. Stickiness. Cohorts. Conversion. Gamification. Oh my!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked inside a modern product organization, you’ve heard these words so often they start to feel unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Metrics Can Be Correct and Still Be Wrong&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most dangerous things about analytics is that they feel objective. A chart is a chart. A number is a number. They have the aesthetic of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked this quote by William Bruce Cameron (often misattributed to Albert Einstein):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metrics don’t measure reality. They measure what your product currently makes easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a well-known warning about this, often summarized as: when a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure. It’s commonly referred to as Goodhart’s Law, and the broader point shows up in multiple fields, because it keeps happening to humans in systems with incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was at Microsoft, a team wanted to remove a feature because “the analytics show that nobody uses it.” If you looked at the UI, though, that feature had been moved deeper and deeper over time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it used to be easy to find&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then it moved into a menu&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then into a submenu&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then into a settings panel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then behind an “advanced” section&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then it was basically invisible&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course nobody used it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analytics didn’t prove the feature was unwanted. The analytics proved that we buried it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even worse, once a metric becomes a target, people get promoted for moving it. That doesn’t require anyone to be malicious. It just requires incentives and a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting in Production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring behavior changes what feels possible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What if we try two versions to see which one performs better?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where A/B testing enters the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, it’s an engineering triumph! Instead of arguing about opinions, you can test ideas. Instead of debating copy or layout in a meeting, you can ship both and let real-world behavior decide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But A/B testing quietly changes the role of the product team. You’re no longer just building a tool and observing how it’s used. You’re now running experiments on people…adjusting wording, placement, timing, friction, and flow to see what moves the metric.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, the product stops being a finished artifact and starts behaving like a laboratory. Every screen becomes provisional, and every interaction becomes a hypothesis. Once that mindset takes hold, it’s very hard not to optimize for what moves fastest, even if it moves the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a quieter consequence here that doesn’t get talked about much. When experimentation becomes the primary decision-making tool, a strong product vision becomes optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not because anyone argues against vision, but because you don’t strictly need it anymore, and because backing a chart is safer than backing an opinion. Metrics have numbers and experiments have winners. If a decision goes wrong, you can always point to the data and say, “we followed the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, this can change the role of a product team where judgment slowly gives way to iteration, and taste gives way to performance. The product still evolves, but it does so without a clear sense of direction…only a sense of momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Guidance Everywhere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once experimentation becomes the default way decisions get made, changing behavior stops being theoretical and starts being procedural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, nudges aren’t a new idea. They’re the obvious next move. It usually starts reasonably:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We shipped a feature. Users might not notice it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you add a little callout. Then a tooltip. Then an onboarding tour. Then a “What’s New” screen. Then a little survey. Then another survey, because you didn’t get enough responses the first time. By the time you’re done dismissing everything, the tool has already taken more time than the task itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever read about “choice architecture” and nudging, this will feel familiar. The modern language for it was popularized in the late 2000s, and the core idea is simple: how choices are presented changes what people do, even if nothing is technically forced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then product teams go one step further. Instead of just shaping choices, you can shape timing. Prompts start showing up in the middle of workflows because that’s when the user is “most engaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry also has a whole discipline around persuasive design and how to move someone from intention to action with prompts, friction removal, and well-timed triggers. B.J. Fogg’s behavior model is one of the more cited frameworks in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some nudges are genuinely helpful. But the same machinery that helps you discover a feature can also be used to push you into something you didn’t come here to do. And once the machinery exists, it gets reused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also why coming back to an app after you’ve been away for as little as a week can feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Not because you forgot how to use the tool, but because the tool has been busy while you were gone. There’s new tips, new tours, new “what’s new” overlays, new announcements, new prompts that all want a click before you’re allowed to do the thing you actually opened it for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Push Notifications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the smartphone era arrived and made interruption cheaper. Once you can send push notifications, you no longer have to wait for the user to open the tool. You can tap them on the shoulder whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s push notification service arrived with iOS 3.0 in 2009, and it’s hard to overstate what a shift this was for the “who initiates the interaction?” question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of this is legitimate and genuinely helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;messages you asked for&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;alerts you configured&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reminders you chose&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we all know where it went:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“We miss you.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“You haven’t finished setup.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“You haven’t tried this feature.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Come back and see what’s new.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All framed as helpful. All measured in engagement. And just like that, the tool starts acting less like a tool and more like a stalker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In Defense&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, not every prompt is evil, and not every notification is marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some software is genuinely complicated, and a little guidance prevents real mistakes. Some categories are basically made of alerts: messaging, security, banking, calendars, delivery tracking, anything where timing actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Telemetry exists because some problems can’t be found any other way. It’s often the only method that enables teams to find the weird crashes that happen on one driver version, one device model, or one edge case you’ll never reproduce in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even the “feature tour” has a defensible origin story. Users ask for improvements, teams ship them, and then users complain they didn’t know the improvements existed. In other words, the same people who hate popups also punish you when you make changes silently. If you’ve ever shipped a big UI redesign, you already know this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the problem isn’t that software ever teaches, asks, or informs. The problem is that once a company builds the machinery to do it, that machinery becomes cheap to reuse, and the incentives gradually pull it away from “help the user succeed” toward “move the metric.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What starts as an occasional heads-up becomes a permanent layer of UI exhaust. What starts as support becomes a funnel. What starts as a reminder becomes a habit-forming system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the drift I’m talking about. Not guidance existing at all, but guidance becoming the default posture of the tool…always talking, always nudging, always taking the first turn in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And once the tool decides it should initiate the interaction, the rest of the story is mostly mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Even the Builders Hate It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most bizarre contradictions in modern software is that the people building these engagement systems don’t like them either!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask anyone who works on onboarding popups, feature tours, lifecycle messaging, or in-app announcements how they feel when an app interrupts them mid-flow to announce something they didn’t ask for. The answer is almost always the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They hate it! Or at least they’re annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find me the telemarketer who likes being called during their own dinner. The job exists because it works enough in aggregate, not because anyone enjoys being on either end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why does it keep happening? Because inside companies, the incentives are clear and the measurements are easy. You can measure clicks and track whether they led to a “completion.” You can measure whether a nudge led to the next step in the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You cannot easily measure the resentment. Or the rage clicks when they smash a button to dismiss another “did you know” pop-up. You cannot easily chart the moment a user thinks, “I used to like this product, and now it feels needy.” You cannot easily quantify the slow erosion of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an older framing for this that I like: in an information-rich world, attention becomes the scarce resource. Herbert Simon wrote about this dynamic in 1971, long before push notifications, app stores, or social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your business runs on attention, and attention is scarce, then the pressure to “capture” it becomes constant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tools Are Supposed to Get Out of the Way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the marketing adage goes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People don’t want a drill. They want a hole in the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drill is just the tool. The outcome is the job. Nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new drill today!” Well, except drill enthusiasts, I suppose. Likewise, nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new app today!” In fact, your app is in the way of their objective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could argue that nobody wants the hole either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What they really want is what comes after the hole. They want to hang photos of family and friends, souvenirs from trips, and artwork that makes a room feel like home. The drill and the hole are both just steps along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That distance matters. The further a tool is from the real human outcome, the more invisible it should be. The drill doesn’t ask how you’re enjoying your experience drilling. It doesn’t upsell you on premium hole-making. It exists to disappear the moment it’s done its job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a useful way to think about software. Most users don’t want “software.” They want the outcome:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;write the document&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;edit the photo&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pay the invoice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;file the taxes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ship the code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;communicate with the team&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great tools get out of the way so the user can accomplish their goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your favorite products feel like they’re not there. You open them, do the thing you came to do, and close them again without ever feeling managed, marketed to, or delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your least favorite products tend to do the opposite. You use them because you have to, not because you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everything Gets “Smart”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is spreading because “smart” is spreading. Smart TVs. Smart speakers. Smart thermostats. Smart appliances. Anything that joins your Wi-Fi can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;update itself (often good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;send diagnostics (often good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;collect usage data (sometimes defensible)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;interrupt you (almost always annoying)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;market to you (almost never what you bought it for)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the same story as software, just with plastic and a power cord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more backchannel: some “smart” TVs use Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) to identify what’s on the screen and turn that into data. It’s basically a pixel-sampled fingerprint of anything that shows up on your screen whether streamed, broadcast, or just played back locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a more academic version of how “data collection leads to prediction which leads to intervention” becomes a business model, this is adjacent to what Shoshana Zuboff describes as surveillance capitalism. It’s not just observing behavior, but intervening to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How We Got Here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these events ruined software by themselves. They just made the next step easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1990s: consumer internet connectivity becomes mainstream, and “online” stops being a special mode.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1996–1997: PointCast popularizes “push” to the desktop (including ads): software starts initiating the interaction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1997: pop-up ads arrive and interruption becomes a business model.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1997: Office 97 ships with “Clippy” the Office Assistant, the friendly ancestor of in-app nudges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2000: “automatic updates” becomes a normal expectation for consumer operating systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2005: Urchin → Google Analytics: instrumentation and dashboards go mainstream.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 10, 2008: the App Store launches and app distribution becomes frictionless.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;June 17, 2009: push notifications arrive at scale on iOS (even if they weren’t first): the app no longer has to wait for you to open it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nov 4, 2009: Apple announces 2 billion push notifications already delivered, early proof that “tap on the shoulder” scales.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2010s: “growth hacking” becomes a discipline; nudges, tours, overlays, and lifecycle messaging become standard product surface area.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By 2011, Apple’s review rules explicitly forbade using push for “advertising, promotions, or direct marketing.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mar 4, 2020: Apple changes course and allows marketing push, but only with explicit opt-in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2020s: “enshittification” becomes a word people recognize because enough people feel the pattern.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People use “enshittification” to describe platform decay. What I’m describing here is one of the mechanisms that makes that decay feel personal. It’s the constant conversion of your attention into a KPI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing for Quiet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go back to floppy disks. I like fast updates. I like security patches. I like sync. I like crash reports when they help fix real issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I want is for “phone home” to be treated like a privileged capability, not an assumed right. In other domains, we treat privileged capabilities with care. We put them behind intentional choices. We build guardrails. And we treat abuse as a bug, not a growth opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few practical ways out. And yes, we’ve heard many of these before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1) Make interruptions opt-in, and make opt-out permanent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to announce a feature, fine. Put it somewhere predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to educate, fine. Let me ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to survey me, fine. Ask at a sensible moment and accept “no” as a real answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, if I turn something off, it should stay off! A tool should not require me to keep saying “not now.” Or conveniently “forget” my choices in its next update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2) Separate product health telemetry from growth telemetry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crash reports, performance metrics, and error logs are about stability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engagement nudges are about behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When those get mixed together, the growth incentives win, because they produce the cleanest charts and the easiest wins. If you can’t draw a clear line between “this helps us fix bugs” and “this helps us juice numbers,” the product will drift toward the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3) Use analytics as a flashlight, not a steering wheel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analytics are useful for asking better questions. They are not answers by themselves. Before removing a feature because “nobody uses it,” ask:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it discoverable?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did we move it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did we rename it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it used rarely because it solves rare but important problems?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it used by a small set of power users who keep the whole system running?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then talk to humans. Analytics can reduce guessing, but it can also create false certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4) Optimize for trust, not just return visits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-term engagement can be increased by annoyance. Long-term loyalty is harder and more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best products I use don’t constantly remind me to use them. They quietly do their job so well that I come back when I need them. That’s what tools are supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5) Ship a real “quiet mode”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not “quiet except for what we care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No popups. No tours. No surveys. No “news.” No nudges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the product is genuinely valuable, quiet mode should improve retention, because it respects the user’s attention and intent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, it’s a nice forcing function. If your product can’t stand on its own without constantly poking the user, that’s a signal. Maybe not the signal you want, but definitely a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software didn’t break all at once. It eroded slowly, one reasonable justification at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each step made sense in isolation, and each step could be defended. Together, they reshaped the priorities of an entire industry. Once software became measurable in this way, it became optimizable in this way. And optimization has a way of eating everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, let’s make software that respects your attention, does its job well, and lets you get on with your life. That’s what good software used to feel like and what it could feel like again. Good software is a tool that you operate, not a channel that operates on you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, I love hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that oats have a beneficial effect on the metabolism is nothing new. German medic Carl von Noorden treated patients with diabetes with the cereal at the beginning of the 20th century – with remarkable success. “Today, effective medications are available to treat patients with diabetes,” explains Marie-Christine Simon, junior professor at the Institute of Nutritional and Food Science at the University of Bonn. “As a result, this method has been almost completely overlooked in recent decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the test subjects in the current trial were not diabetic, they suffered from a metabolic syndrome associated with an increased risk of diabetes. The characteristics include excess body weight, high blood pressure, an elevated blood sugar level, and lipid metabolism disorders. “We wanted to know how a special oat-based diet affects patients,” explains Simon, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Areas “Life &amp;amp; Health” and „Sustainable Futures“ at the University of Bonn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;300 grams of oatmeal per day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The participants were asked to exclusively eat oatmeal, which they had previously boiled in water, three times a day. They were only allowed to add some fruit or vegetables to their meals. A total of 32 women and men completed this oat-based diet. They ate 300 grams of oatmeal on each of the two days and only consumed around half of their normal calories. A control group was also put on a calorie-reduced diet, although this did not consist of oats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both groups benefited from the change in diet. However, the effect was much more pronounced for the participants who followed the oat-based diet. “The level of particularly harmful LDL cholesterol fell by 10 percent for them – that is a substantial reduction, although not entirely comparable to the effect of modern medications,” stresses Simon. “They also lost two kilos in weight on average and their blood pressure fell slightly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effect on LDL cholesterol, in particular, is likely to be relevant to health. If the blood contains too much of this, it is deposited in the vessel walls. These deposits, known as plaques, narrow the blood vessels. In addition, the deposits can rupture, for instance due to an increase in blood pressure following physical exertion, anger, or stress. As a result, a blood clot can form at the affected site, completely blocking the blood vessel. Alternatively, parts of the plaque can be washed away by the blood and cause a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oats promote the growth of “healthy” intestinal bacteria&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how does oatmeal exert its beneficial effect? “We were able to identify that the consumption of oatmeal increased the number of certain bacteria in the gut,” explains Simon’s colleague Linda Klümpen, the lead author of the trial. The microbiome has increasingly been the focus of research in recent decades. After all, it is now known that intestinal bacteria play a decisive role in metabolizing food. They also release the metabolic by-products that they create into their environment. They supply, among other things, the cells of the gut with energy, enabling them to better perform their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the microbes send some of their products around the body in the blood stream, where they can have various effects. “For instance, we were able to show that intestinal bacteria produce phenolic compounds by breaking down the oats,” says Klümpen. “It has already been shown in animal studies that one of them, ferulic acid, has a positive effect on the cholesterol metabolism. This also appears to be the case for some of the other bacterial metabolic products.” At the same time, other microorganisms “dispose of” the amino acid histidine. The body otherwise turns this into a molecule that is suspected of promoting insulin resistance. This insensitivity to insulin is a key feature of diabetes mellitus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A large amount of oats for two days better than a small amount for six weeks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The positive effects of the oat-based diet tended to still be evident six weeks later. “A short-term oat-based diet at regular intervals could be a well-tolerated way to keep the cholesterol level within the normal range and prevent diabetes,” says Junior Professor Simon. However, in the current study, the cereal above all exerted its effect at a high concentration and in conjunction with a calorie reduction: A six-week diet, in which the participants consumed 80 grams of oats per day, without any other restrictions, achieved small effects. “As a next step, it can now be clarified whether an intensive oat-based diet repeated every six weeks actually has a permanently preventative effect,” continues Simon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test method:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A total of 68 participants took part in the trial. For the two-day short-term oat-based diet, all 17 participants on the oat-based diet and 15 participants on the control diet successfully completed the study phase. Two participants in the control group withdrew for personal reasons. For the six-week long-term oat-based intervention, 17 participants in the study group and the same number in the control group took part until the end. The sample size of 17 participants per group was calculated by the researchers on the basis of data from an earlier interventional trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the two-day intensive diet and the six-week trial with a moderate dose of oats were randomized controlled trials. In these “RCTs,” the test subjects are divided into two groups at random (i.e. randomized). One of them receives the potential active ingredient – in this case the oats –, but the other (the control group) does not. Ideally, the test subjects are “blind”: They do not know to which group they belong. This rules out any placebo effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In nutritional experiments, blinding is often not possible – those involved ultimately generally know what they are eating. This was also the case in these studies. However, the evaluation of the blood and stool samples was indeed “blind”: The researchers in charge of this were not informed whether the material had been taken from members of the test group or the control group. The same also applied to the blood pressure and weight measurements. This ruled out the possibility of the scientists’ expectations falsifying the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blood and stool samples were taken before the participants made any changes to their diet. Their blood pressure, weight, height, waist size, and body fat were also measured. A second examination took place immediately after the two-day oat-based diet, followed by three others after two, four, and six weeks. The same analysis were conducted on these four visits as during the initial examination and further blood and stool samples were collected. The researchers took the same approach during the second nutritional study, in which the subjects consumed 80 grams of oatmeal a day for six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blood samples were examined in the lab for their LDL cholesterol content, among other things. The researchers also measured the concentration of a key molecule, dihydroferulic acid. This phenolic compound is presumably formed by certain intestinal bacteria, which are known to have a health-promoting effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By examining the stool samples, the researchers were able to confirm this hypothesis. They isolated what is known as 16S RNA from the samples. This is a molecule that exclusively occurs in bacteria, but differs somewhat between different species. A 16S RNA molecule can thus be used to identify the bacterium from which it originates, just like a fingerprint. The researchers also analyzed which metabolic products were present in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze: SpaceX’s Space Situational Awareness System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX has developed a novel Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system, called Stargaze, that significantly enhances the safety and sustainability of satellite operations in low Earth orbit (LEO), and its screening data will be made available to the broader satellite operator community free of charge in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practices—such as leaving rocket bodies in LEO, operators maneuvering their satellites without sharing trajectory predictions or coordinating with other active satellites, and countries conducting anti-satellite tests—have heightened the risk of collision, necessitating improvements in space-traffic coordination. Conventional methods typically observe objects only a limited number of times per day, causing large uncertainties in orbital predictions, further compounded by volatile space weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze delivers a several-order-of-magnitude increase in detection capability compared to conventional ground-based systems. Stargaze uses data collected from nearly 30,000 star trackers, each of which makes continuous observations of nearby objects, resulting in approximately 30 million transits detected daily across the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system autonomously detects observations of orbiting objects and are then aggregated to generate accurate orbit estimates and predictions of position and velocity for all detected objects in near real-time. These predictions integrate into a space-traffic management platform that identifies potential close approaches between objects in space and generates Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs). To fully realize the utility of such frequent observations, SpaceX developed this system to provide conjunction screening results within minutes, compared to the current industry standard of several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To maximize safety for all satellites in space, SpaceX will be making Stargaze conjunction data available to all operators, free of charge, via its space-traffic management platform. This platform has been in a “closed beta” with over a dozen participating satellite operators, allowing low-latency ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening. Starting this spring, operators that submit ephemeris (trajectory predictions) to the platform will also receive CDMs against Stargaze data, in addition to ephemeris from other participating operators. This ensures that operators have low-latency access to the best available data for conjunction assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze already has a proven track record in its utility for space safety. In late 2025, a Starlink satellite encountered a conjunction with a third-party satellite that was performing maneuvers, but whose operator was not sharing ephemeris. Until five hours before the conjunction, the close approach was anticipated to be ~9,000 meters—considered a safe miss-distance with zero probability of collision. With just five hours to go, the third-party satellite performed a maneuver which changed its trajectory and collapsed the anticipated miss distance to just ~60 meters. Stargaze quickly detected this maneuver and published an updated trajectory to the screening platform, generating new CDMs which were immediately distributed to relevant satellites. Ultimately, the Starlink satellite was able to react within an hour of the maneuver being detected, planning an avoidance maneuver to reduce collision risk back down to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With so little time to react, this would not have been possible by relying on legacy radar systems or high-latency conjunction screening processes. If observations of the third-party satellite were less frequent, conjunction screening took longer, or the reaction required human approval, such an event might not have been successfully mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Stargaze embodies a major improvement to the ability of any operator to fly safely, it is imperative for operators to frequently share ephemeris of their own fleets. This is particularly true for operators with maneuvering vehicles. While Stargaze can detect maneuvers more quickly than any other system in use today, the most definitive source of satellite trajectories should be provided by operators themselves, allowing deconfliction and minimizing collision avoidance maneuvers. Starlink ephemeris is updated and shared publicly every hour, and all other operators should do the same. An appropriate analogy is commercial aviation: there are hundreds of thousands of flights of aircraft daily, but they are able to avoid collisions because they broadcast their location and flight plan to other aircraft. Similarly, spacecraft operators should follow this minimal standard of sharing their predicted trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By providing this ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening service free of charge, we hope to motivate operators to take similar steps towards ephemeris sharing and safe flight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I hacked together a weekend project. What started as “WhatsApp Relay” now has over 100,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I’m excited to announce our new name: OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Naming Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been through some names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clawd was born in November 2025—a playful pun on “Claude” with a claw. It felt perfect until Anthropic’s legal team politely asked us to reconsider. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moltbot came next, chosen in a chaotic 5am Discord brainstorm with the community. Molting represents growth - lobsters shed their shells to become something bigger. It was meaningful, but it never quite rolled off the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is where we land. And this time, we did our homework: trademark searches came back clear, domains have been purchased, migration code has been written. The name captures what this project has become:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open: Open source, open to everyone, community-driven&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claw: Our lobster heritage, a nod to where we came from&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What OpenClaw Is&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs on your machine and works from the chat apps you already use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams—wherever you are, your AI assistant follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else’s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose—laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s New in This Release&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with the rebrand, we’re shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New Channels: Twitch and Google Chat plugins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models: Support for KIMI K2.5 &amp;amp; Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web Chat: Send images just like you can in messaging apps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: 34 security-related commits to harden the codebase&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project. We’ve released machine-checkable security models this week and are continuing to work on additional security improvements. Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem, so it’s important to use strong models and to study our security best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s next? Security remains our top priority. We’re also focused on gateway reliability and adding polish plus support for more models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone. Over the last few days I’ve worked on adding maintainers and we’re slowly setting up processes so we can deal with the insane influx of PRs and Issues. I’m also figuring out how to pay maintainers properly—full-time if possible. If you wanna help, consider contributing or sponsoring the org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank You&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the Claw Crew—every clawtributor who’s shipped code, filed issues, joined our Discord, or just tried the project: thank you. You are what makes OpenClaw special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lobster has molted into its final form. Welcome to OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started: openclaw.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join the Claw Crew: Discord&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Star on GitHub: github.com/openclaw/openclaw&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— Peter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. Yes, the mascot is still a lobster. Some things are sacred. 🦞&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820783</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:14:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skills</title><link>https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="b720e598aba307c3"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research shows AI helps people do parts of their job faster. In an observational study of Claude.ai data, we found AI can speed up some tasks by 80%. But does this increased productivity come with trade-offs? Other research shows that when people use AI assistance, they become less engaged with their work and reduce the effort they put into doing it—in other words, they offload their thinking to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether this cognitive offloading can prevent people from growing their skills on the job, or—in the case of coding—understanding the systems they’re building. Our latest study, a randomized controlled trial with software developers as participants, investigates this potential downside of using AI at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This question has broad implications—for how to design AI products that facilitate learning, for how workplaces should approach AI policies, and for broader societal resilience, among others. We focused on coding, a field where AI tools have rapidly become standard. Here, AI creates a potential tension: as coding grows more automated and speeds up work, humans will still need the skills to catch errors, guide output, and ultimately provide oversight for AI deployed in high-stakes environments. Does AI provide a shortcut to both skill development and increased efficiency? Or do productivity increases from AI assistance undermine skill development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a randomized controlled trial, we examined 1) how quickly software developers picked up a new skill (in this case, a Python library) with and without AI assistance; and 2) whether using AI made them less likely to understand the code they’d just written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery. On a quiz that covered concepts they’d used just a few minutes before, participants in the AI group scored 17% lower than those who coded by hand, or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. Using AI sped up the task slightly, but this didn’t reach the threshold of statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, using AI assistance didn’t guarantee a lower score. How someone used AI influenced how much information they retained. The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Study design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recruited 52 (mostly junior) software engineers, each of whom had been using Python at least once a week for over a year. We also made sure they were at least somewhat familiar with AI coding assistance, and were unfamiliar with Trio, the Python library on which our tasks were based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We split the study into three parts: a warm-up; the main task consisting of coding two different features using Trio (which requires understanding concepts related to asynchronous programming, a skill often learned in a professional setting); and a quiz. We told participants that a quiz would follow the task, but encouraged them to work as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We designed the coding task to mimic how someone might learn a new tool through a self-guided tutorial. Each participant was given a problem description, starter code, and a brief explanation of the Trio concepts needed to solve it. We used an online coding platform with an AI assistant in the sidebar which had access to participants’ code and could at any time produce the correct code if asked.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Evaluation design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our evaluation design, we drew on research in computer science education to identify four types of questions commonly used to assess mastery of coding skills:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging: The ability to identify and diagnose errors in code. This skill is crucial for detecting when AI-generated code is incorrect and understanding why it fails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code reading: The ability to read and comprehend what code does. This skill enables humans to understand and verify AI-written code before deployment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code writing: The ability to write or select the correct approach to writing code. Low-level code writing, like remembering the syntax of functions, will be less important with the further integration of AI coding tools than high-level system design.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual: The ability to understand the core principles behind tools and libraries. Conceptual understanding is critical for assessing whether AI-generated code uses appropriate software design patterns that adhere to how the library is intended to be used.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our assessment focused most heavily on debugging, code reading, and conceptual problems, as we considered these the most important for providing oversight of what is increasingly likely to be AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen's d=0.738, p=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Qualitative analysis: AI interaction modes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were particularly interested in understanding how participants went about completing the tasks we designed. In our qualitative analysis, we manually annotated screen recordings to identify how much time participants spent composing queries, what types of questions they asked, the types of errors they made, and how much time they spent actively coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One surprising result was how much time participants spent interacting with the AI assistant. Several took up to 11 minutes (30% of the total time allotted) composing up to 15 queries. This helped to explain why, on average, participants using AI finished faster although the productivity improvement was not statistically significant. We expect AI would be more likely to significantly increase productivity when used on repetitive or familiar tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, participants in the No AI group encountered more errors. These included errors in syntax and in Trio concepts, the latter of which mapped directly to topics tested on the evaluation. Our hypothesis is that the participants who encountered more Trio errors (namely, the control group) likely improved their debugging skills through resolving these errors independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then grouped participants by how they interacted with AI, identifying distinct patterns that led to different outcomes in completion time and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-scoring interaction patterns: The low-scoring patterns generally involved a heavy reliance on AI, either through code generation or debugging. The average quiz scores in this group were less than 40%. They showed less independent thinking and more cognitive offloading. We further separated them into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI delegation (n=4): Participants in this group wholly relied on AI to write code and complete the task. They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Progressive AI reliance (n=4): Participants in this group started by asking one or two questions but eventually delegated all code writing to the AI assistant. They scored poorly on the quiz largely due to not mastering any of the concepts on the second task.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterative AI debugging (n=4): Participants in this group relied on AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly as a result, and were also slower at completing the two tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-scoring interaction patterns: We considered high-scoring quiz patterns to be behaviors where the average quiz score was 65% or higher. Participants in these clusters used AI both for code generation and conceptual queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generation-then-comprehension (n=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. After their code was generated, they asked the AI assistant follow-up questions to improve understanding. These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid code-explanation (n=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual inquiry (n=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Although this group encountered many errors, they also independently resolved them. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our qualitative analysis does not draw a causal link between interaction patterns and learning outcomes, but it does point to behaviors associated with different learning outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that incorporating AI aggressively into the workplace, particularly with respect to software engineering, comes with trade-offs. The findings highlight that not all AI-reliance is the same: the way we interact with AI while trying to be efficient affects how much we learn. Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though preliminary, these results suggest important considerations as companies transition to a greater ratio of AI-written to human-written code. Productivity benefits may come at the cost of skills necessary to validate AI-written code if junior engineers’ skill development has been stunted by using AI in the first place. Managers should think intentionally about how to deploy AI tools at scale, and consider systems or intentional design choices that ensure engineers continue to learn as they work—and are thus able to exercise meaningful oversight over the systems they build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For novice workers in software engineering or any other industry, our study can be viewed as a small piece of evidence toward the value of intentional skill development with AI tools. Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery. This is also a lesson that applies to how individuals choose to work with AI, and which tools they use. Major LLM services also provide learning modes (e.g., Claude Code Learning and Explanatory mode or ChatGPT Study Mode) designed to foster understanding. Knowing how people learn when using AI can also help guide how we design it; AI assistance should enable humans to work more efficiently and develop new skills at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior studies have found mixed results on whether AI helps or hinders coding productivity. Our own research found that AI can reduce the time it takes to complete some work tasks by 80%—a result that may seem in tension with the findings presented here. But the two studies ask different questions and use different methods: our earlier observational work measured productivity on tasks where participants already had the relevant skills, while this study examines what happens when people are learning something new. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study is only a first step towards uncovering how human-AI collaboration affects the experience of workers. Our sample was relatively small, and our assessment measured comprehension shortly after the coding task. Whether immediate quiz performance predicts longer-term skill development is an important question this study does not resolve. There remain many unanswered questions we hope future studies will investigate, for example: the effects of AI on tasks beyond coding, whether this effect dissipates longitudinally as engineers develop greater fluency, and whether AI assistance differs from human assistance while learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, to accommodate skill development in the presence of AI, we need a more expansive view of the impacts of AI on workers. In an AI-augmented workplace, productivity gains matter, but so does the long-term development of the expertise those gains depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Importantly, this setup is different from agentic coding products like Claude Code; we expect that the impacts of such programs on skill development are likely to be more pronounced than the results here.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Judy Hanwen Shen [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:40:43 UTC (2,680 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.CY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is planning a Linux-native GOG Galaxy, calling Linux the 'next major frontier.'&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is hiring a senior engineer to shape Galaxy's architecture for Linux from day one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Galaxy will let Linux users relive classics without the usual headaches.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming on Linux used to be in a nasty catch-22. People wouldn't develop games for Linux because gamers didn't use it, and gamers didn't use Linux because people wouldn't develop games for it. However, with the advancement of tech like Proton, we're beginning to see people take Linux seriously as a gaming powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn't mean that the Linux community won't welcome developers who create Linux-native versions of their games and related apps. So, when the news broke that GOG was hiring a developer to help get its library app over into the world of FOSS, it was good news for everyone who wants to bring the classics over to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;GOG's new owner details how he plans to take on Steam: publish less chaff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world of monopolies, GOG wants a niche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GOG calls Linux "a major frontier" as it aims to make Galaxy Linux-native&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It's the next step in GOG's plans to appeal to Linux users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by VideoCardz, a recent job advertisement on the GOG website revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46821774</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:09:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Tesla's Robotaxi data confirms crash rate 3x worse than humans even with monitor</title><link>https://electrek.co/2026/01/29/teslas-own-robotaxi-data-confirms-crash-rate-3x-worse-than-humans-even-with-monitor/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="6dee064e15b5729d"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla’s nascent robotaxi program is off to a rough start. New NHTSA crash data, combined with Tesla’s new disclosure of robotaxi mileage, reveals Tesla’s autonomous vehicles are crashing at a rate much higher tha human drivers, and that’s with a safety monitor in every car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to NHTSA’s Standing General Order crash reports, Tesla has reported 9 crashes involving its robotaxi fleet in Austin, Texas between July and November 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 2025: Right turn collision&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;October 2025: Incident at 18 mph&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Hit an animal at 27 mph&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Collision with cyclist&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Rear collision while backing (6 mph)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Hit a fixed object in parking lot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2025: Collision with SUV in construction zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2025: Hit fixed object, causing minor injury (8 mph)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2025: Right turn collision with SUV&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to a chart in Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings report showing cumulative robotaxi miles, the fleet has traveled approximately 500,000 miles as of November 2025. That works out to roughly one crash every 55,000 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, human drivers in the United States average approximately one police-reported crash every 500,000 miles, according to NHTSA data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means Tesla’s robotaxis are crashing at a rate 9 times higher than the average human driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, that figure doesn’t include non-police-reported incidents. When adding those, or rather an estimate of those, humans are closer to 200,000 miles between crashes, which is still a lot better than Tesla’s robotaxi in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The safety monitor problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what makes this data particularly damning: every Tesla robotaxi in the reported mileage had a safety monitor in the vehicle who can intervene at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren’t fully autonomous vehicles operating without backup. There’s a human sitting in the car whose entire job is to prevent crashes. And yet Tesla’s crash rate is still nearly an order of magnitude worse than regular human drivers operating alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waymo, by comparison, operates a fully driverless fleet, no safety monitor, no human backup, and reports significantly better safety numbers. Waymo has logged over 25 million autonomous miles and maintains a crash rate well below human averages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The transparency gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps more troubling than the crash rate is Tesla’s complete lack of transparency about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every single Tesla crash narrative in the NHTSA database is redacted with the same phrase: “[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know a Tesla robotaxi hit a cyclist. We don’t know what happened.&lt;lb/&gt;We know one caused a minor injury. We don’t know what happened.&lt;lb/&gt;We know one hit an animal at 27 mph. We don’t know what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Waymo, Zoox, and other AV operators provide full narrative descriptions of every incident. Here’s a typical Waymo report from the same dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on N. 16th Street in the left lane when it slowed to a stop to yield to a pedestrian that had begun crossing the roadway. While the pedestrian continued to cross and the Waymo AV remained stopped, a passenger car approaching from behind made contact with the rear of the stationary Waymo AV.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s accountability. That’s transparency. Tesla provides none of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clear that Tesla is not responsible for some of these crashes, but the fact that we don’t know is entirely due to Tesla’s own secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great example is an incident that happened last week in Santa Monica, California, where a Waymo hit a child in a school zone. That sounds awful, doesn’t it? Potentially a company-ending incident, but Waymo released all the details, which confirmed that the child ran into the street while hidden behind an SUV. The Waymo vehicle immediately detected the child and while it didn’t have to time to prevent the impact, it was able to apply the brakes and reduce the speed from 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the child was OK. Waymo even claims that its models show that a human driver would have likely reacted more slowly and hit the kid at twice the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s better to know about these incidents than to keep everything secret to avoid publicizing those you are responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s good and there’s bad in this. With only a crash in October and one in November, there appears to be improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the overall data is sobering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by Nx&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is also not captured in the statistics is exactly how many interventions were made by the safety operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3X worse than humans number for Tesla Robotaxi is actually incredibly over-optimistic as a projection for operation without safety operators. Because it excludes all the accidents that were prevented by safety operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A crash every 55,000 miles, with a safety monitor in the car, is not robotaxi-ready. It’s not even close. And the complete lack of transparency about what’s causing these crashes makes it impossible to have confidence that Tesla is learning from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waymo operates fully driverless vehicles in multiple cities and publishes detailed information about every incident. Tesla operates supervised vehicles in one geofenced area and redacts everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Tesla wants to be taken seriously as a robotaxi operator, it needs to do two things: dramatically improve its safety record, and start being honest about what’s happening on the roads of Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, it’s failing at both.&lt;/p&gt;
