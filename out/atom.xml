    &lt;p&gt;Every quarter, Drive Stats gives us the numbers. This quarter, it gave us a crisis of meaning. What does it really mean for a hard drive to fail? Is it the moment the lights go out, or the moment we decide they have? Philosophers might call that an ontological gray area. We just call it Q3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of June 30, 2025, we had 332,915 drives under management. Of that total, there were 3,970 boot drives and 328,348 data drives. Let’s dig into our stats, then talk about the meaning of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;This quarter, we have more to talk about (Stats-wise)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drive Stats was the beginning. Want to see more of the full picture? Check out the Stats Lab webinar, bringing together content from all of our Stats articles. We’re going to chat about all things Backblaze (and beyond)—by the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Drive Stats: The digest version&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Q3 2025 hard drive failure rates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During Q3 2025, we were tracking 328,348 storage drives. Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backblaze Hard Drive Failure Rates for Q3 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reporting period July 1, 2025–September 30, 2025 inclusive&lt;lb/&gt;Drive models with drive count &amp;gt; 100 as of July 1, 2025 and drive days &amp;gt; 10,000 in Q3 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Notes and observations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The failure rate has increased: The failure rate has changed, and by quite a bit. As a reminder, last quarter’s AFR was 1.36% compared with this quarter’s 1.55%. (Interestingly, the 2024 yearly AFR was 1.57%.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That new drive energy: Say hello to the 24TB Toshiba MG11ACA24TE, joining the drive pool with 2,400 drives and 24,148 drive days. That means that we’ve hit the thresholds for the quarterly stats, but not the lifetime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The zero failure club: It was a big month for the zero failure club, with four drives making the cut: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Seagate HMS5C4040BLE640 (4TB)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Seagate ST8000NM000A (8TB)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Toshiba MG09ACA16TE (16TB)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Toshiba MG11ACA24TE (24TB)—and yes, that’s the new drive.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those of you tracking the stats closely, you’ll notice that the Seagate ST8000NM000A (8TB) is a frequent flier on this list. The last time it had a failure was in Q3 2024—and it was just a single failure for the whole quarter!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The highest AFRs were really high: The high end was so high that this month, it inspired us to run an outlier analysis using the standard quartile analysis (Tukey method). Based on that information, any drive with a quarterly AFR higher than 5.88% is an outlier, and there are three: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB): 7.97%&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB): 6.86%&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB): 16.95%&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s going on there? Great question, and we’ll get into that after the lifetime failure rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lifetime hard drive failure rates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be considered for the lifetime review, a drive model was required to have 500 or more drives as of the end of Q2 2025 and have over 100,000 accumulated drive days during their lifetime. When we removed those drive models which did not meet the lifetime criteria, we had drives grouped into 27 models remaining for analysis as shown in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backblaze Hard Drive Failure Rates for Q2 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reporting period ending September 30, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;Drive models &amp;gt; 500 drives and &amp;gt; 100,000 lifetime drive days&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Notes and observations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That lifetime AFR is pretty consistent, isn’t it? The lifetime AFR is 1.31%. Last quarter we reported that it was 1.30%, and the quarter before that, it was 1.31%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The 4TB average age hasn’t shifted: As we’ve reported on previously, the 4TB drives are being decommissioned over time. Now, we’re down to just a handful left—just 11 of the ALE models and 187 of the BLE models. But, because their lifetime populations are so comparatively large, the additional drive days aren’t enough to move the needle on the average age in months. So, no ghosts in the machine here, and decommissioning is proceeding as planned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Steady uptick in higher capacity drives: Of the 20TB+ drives that meet our lifetime data parameters, we’ve added 7,936 since last quarter. And, don’t forget that our newest entrée to the cohort, the Toshiba MG11ACA24TE (24TB), hasn’t made its way to this table yet—that adds an additional 2,400 drive models. All together, the 20TB+ club represents 67,939 drives, or about 21% of the drive pool.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Defining a failure—from a technical perspective&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A question that’s come up a few times when we’re hosting a webinar or chatting in the comments section is how we define a failure. While it may seem intuitive, it’s actually something of a meaty conundrum, and something we haven’t addressed since the early days of this series. Tracking down the answer to this question touches internal drive fleet monitoring tools (via SMART stats), the actual Drive Stats collection program, and our data engineering layer. I’ll dig into each of these in detail, then we’ll take a look at the outliers for this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;SMART stats reporting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use Smartmontools to collect the SMART attributes of drives, and another monitoring tool called drive sentinel to flag read/write errors that exceed a certain threshold as well as some other anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main indicator we use for determining if a drive should be replaced is when it responds to reads with uncorrectable medium errors. When a drive reads the data from the disk, but the data fails its integrity check, the drive will try to reconstruct the data using internal error correction codes. If it is unable to reconstruct the data, it notifies the host by reporting it as an uncorrectable error and marks that part of the disk as pending reallocation, which shows up in SMART under an attribute like &lt;code&gt;Current_Pending_Sector&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Storage Pods that control drives through SATA links, the drive sentinel will count the number of these uncorrectable errors a drive reports and if it exceeds a threshold, access to the drive will be removed. This is important in the classic Backblaze Storage Pods where five drives share a single SATA link and errors by one drive will affect all drives on the link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Dell and SMCI pods that use a SAS topology to connect drives, drive sentinel doesn’t remove access to drives because the errors are reported differently; but, that’s also not as critical since SAS minimizes the impact that a problem disk can have on others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Drive Stats program&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about the custom program we use to collect Drive Stats in the past, and here’s a quick recap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The podstats generator runs on every Storage Pod, what we call any host that holds customer data, every few minutes. It’s a C++ program that collects SMART stats and a few other attributes, then converts them into an .xml file (“podstats”). Those are then pushed to a central host in each datacenter and bundled. Once the data leaves these central hosts, it has entered the domain of what we will call Drive Stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this program, the logic is relatively simple: A failure in Drive Stats occurs when a drive vanishes out of the reporting population. It is considered “failed” until it shows up again. Drives are tracked by serial number and we report daily logs on a per-drive basis, so truly, we can get pretty granular here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The data engineering layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To recap, we’ve collected our SMART stats and compiled them with the podstats program. Now we’ve got all the information, and data intelligence needs to add the context. A drive may go offline for a day or so (not return a response to those tools that collect daily logs of SMART stats), but it could be something as simple as a loose cable. So, time-wise, if a drive reappears after one day or 30, at what point in that period of time do we classify it as an official failure?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, we manually cross-referenced data center work tickets, but these days, we’ve automated that process. On the backend, it’s a SQL query, but in human speak, this is what it comes down to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a drive logs data on the last day of the selection period (which in this case is a quarter) then it has not failed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are three human-curated tables that the query cross references. If a drive serial number appears on one of them, it tells us whether there’s a failure or not (depending on the table’s function).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the drive serial number is the primary serial number in a drive replacement Jira ticket then it has failed. (Jira is where we track our data center work tickets.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the drive serial number is the target serial number in a clone Jira ticket or a (temp) replacement ticket, then it has not failed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, when we go to write the Drive Stats reports at the end of the quarter, if a drive has either appeared in one of our various work trackers or hasn’t re-entered the population, then it’s considered failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In rare instances, that can mean that we have so-called “cosmetic” failures when we have some work we’re doing on a drive model that lasts more than that quarterly collection period. And, spoiler, we have one of those instances that showed up in the data this month—our outlier Toshiba drive with the 16.9% failure rate. We’ll dig in in just a minute; but first, some context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Connecting drive failure to overall picture of the drive pool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, certain drives in the pool had such high swings in AFR that we ended up running an outlier analysis using the quartile method. (It’s also worth mentioning that a cluster analysis could potentially be a better fit, but we can save that for another day.) Based on that analysis, anything that has above a 5.88% failure rate is an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary motivation was inspired by an attempt to visualize the relationship between the age in months of a drive versus this quarter’s AFRs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, we’re fully aware that that’s a… super unreadable scatter plot. Removing the labels, this is a bit better:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re interested, really, in the shape of the relationship. If we posit that the older drives get, the higher their failure rates, you’d expect a larger concentration in the top right quadrant. But, our data follows a much more interesting pattern than that, with most of our data points concentrated in the lowest regions of the graph regardless of age—something you’d expect from a set of data that reflects a bunch of smart folks actively working towards the goal of a healthy drive population. And yet, we have some data points that break the mold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is pretty intuitive to my business intelligence folks in the audience, the process of identifying outliers is actionable data as well. Just like all press is good press; in our world, more data is more better. So, let’s take a closer look at those outliers. As a reminder, that’s these three drive models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB): 7.97%&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB): 6.86%&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB): 16.95%&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seagate ST10000NM0086 (10TB)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This drive has some pretty explainable factors for the high failure rate. It’s well over seven years old (92.35 months). And, since it only has 1,018 drive models in operation, single failures hold a lot of weight compared with the average drive count per model—which comes in at 10,952 if you use the mean of this quarterly data and 6,177 if you use the median.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, you can see that borne out in the trend in the last year of data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seagate ST14000NM0138 (14TB)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This drive is nearing five years in age (56.57 months) and, again, has a lower drive count at 1,286. More importantly, this particular drive model has had historically high failure rates. In parallel with above, here’s the last year of quarterly failure rates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY (16TB)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, our Toshiba model is the most interesting of all. It’s less than four years old (44.61 months), and has 5,145 drives in the pool. And, this quarter is clearly a change from its normal, decent, AFRs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we see deviations like this one, it’s usually an indication that there’s something afoot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never fear, Drive Stats fans; this was a known quantity before we went on this journey. This past quarter, working with Toshiba, we deployed some firmware updates they provided to optimize performance on these drives. Because we needed to pull drives to achieve this in some cases, we had an abnormal number of “failed” drives in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What that means for this drive is that it’s actually not a bad drive model; and, given the ways we and Toshiba have worked together on a fix, we should see failure rates normalizing in the near future. And, this also goes back to our conversation of defining a failure—in this case, while the drives “failed,” the failure wasn’t mechanical and was based on something that we’ll be able to fix without replacing the drives. In short, don’t sweat the spike and pay attention to the long arc of performance on this population. We expect to see those drives happy and spinning for years to come (and with better performance, too).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;JP Morgan says Nvidia is gearing up to sell entire AI servers instead of just AI GPUs and components — Jensen's master plan of vertical integration will boost Nvidia profits, purportedly starting with Vera Rubin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The launch of Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform for AI and HPC next year could mark significant changes in the AI hardware supply chain as Nvidia plans to ship its partners fully assembled Level-10 (L10) VR200 compute trays with all compute hardware, cooling systems, and interfaces pre-installed, according to J.P. Morgan (via @Jukanlosreve). The move would leave major ODMs with very little design or integration work, making their lives easier, but would also trim their margins in favor of Nvidia's. The information remains unofficial at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with the VR200 platform, Nvidia is reportedly preparing to take over production of fully built L10 compute trays with a pre-installed Vera CPU, Rubin GPUs, and a cooling system instead of allowing hyperscalers and ODM partners to build their own motherboards and cooling solutions. This would not be the first time the company has supplied its partners with a partially integrated server sub-assembly: it did so with its GB200 platform when it supplied the whole Bianca board with key components pre-installed. However, at the time, this could be considered as L7 – L8 integration, whereas now the company is reportedly considering going all the way to L10, selling the whole tray assembly — including accelerators, CPU, memory, NICs, power-delivery hardware, midplane interfaces, and liquid-cooling cold plates — as a pre-built, tested module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the information is correct, and Nvidia will indeed ship its partners L10 compute trays (which probably account for 90% of the cost of a server), then Nvidia will only leave its partners with rack-level integration rather than server design. They would still build the outer chassis, integrate power supplies depending on requirements, install sidecars or CDUs for rack-level cooling, add their own BMC and management stack, and perform final assembly and testing. These tasks matter operationally, but they do not differentiate hardware in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This move promises to shorten the ramp for VR200 as Nvidia's partners will not have to design everything in-house and could lower production costs due to the volume of scale ensured by a direct contract between Nvidia and an EMS (most likely Foxconn as the primary supplier and then Quanta and Wistron, but that is speculation). For example, a Vera Rubin Superchip board recently demonstrated by Jensen Huang uses a very complex design, a very thick PCB, and only solid-state components. Designing such a board takes time and costs a lot of money, so using select EMS provider(s) to build it makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan reportedly mentions the increase in power consumption of one Rubin GPU from 1.4 kW (Blackwell Ultra) to 1.8 kW (R200) and even 2.3 kW (a previously unannounced TDP for an allegedly unannounced SKU (Nvidia declined a Tom's Hardware request for comment on the matter) and increased cooling requirements as one of the motivations for moving to supply the whole tray instead of individual components. However, we know from reported supply chain sources that various OEMs and ODMs, as well as hyperscalers like Microsoft, are experimenting with very advanced cooling systems, including immersion and embedded cooling, which underscores their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Nvidia's partners will shift from being system designers to becoming system integrators, installers, and support providers. They are going to keep enterprise features, service contracts, firmware ecosystem work, and deployment logistics, but the 'heart' of the server — the compute engine — is now fixed, standardized, and produced by Nvidia rather than by OEMs or ODMs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, we can only wonder what will happen with Nvidia's Kyber NVL576 rack-scale solution based on the Rubin Ultra platform, which is set to launch alongside the emergence of 800V data center architecture meant to enable megawatt-class racks and beyond. Now the only question is whether Nvidia further increases its share in the supply chain to, say, rack-level integration?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AGI fantasy is a blocker to actual engineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading Empire of AI by Karen Hao, I was struck by how people associated with OpenAI believe in AGI. They really do think someone, perhaps them, will build AGI, and that it will lead to either the flourishing or destruction of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk founded OpenAI because he thought Demis Hassabis was an evil genius who would build AGI first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…Musk would regularly characterise Hassabis as a supervillain who needed to be stopped. Musk would make unequivocally clear that OpenAI was the good to DeepMind’s evil. … “He literally made a video game where an evil genius tries to create AI to take over the world,” Musk shouted [at an OpenAI off-site], referring to Hassabis’s 2004 title Evil Genius, “and fucking people don’t see it. Fucking people don’t see it! And Larry [Page]? Larry thinks he controls Demis but he’s too busy fucking windsurfing to realize that Demis is gathering the power.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever regularly told audiences and employees to “feel the AGI”. At a company off-site in Yosemite in September 2022, employees gathered around a firepit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the pit, [Sutskever] had placed a wooden effigy that he’d commissioned from a local artist, and began a dramatic performance. This effigy, he explained represented a good, aligned AGI that OpenAI had built, only to discover it was actually lying and deceitful. OpenAI’s duty, he said, was to destroy it. … Sutskever doused the effigy in lighter fluid and lit on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s remarkable that what was until recently sci-fi fantasy has become a mainstream view in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hao writes that GPT-2 was a bet on the “pure language” hypothesis, that asserts that since we communicate through language, then AGI should emerge from training a model solely on language. This is contrast to the “grounding” hypothesis, that asserts an AGI needs to perceive the world. Successfully scaling GPT to GPT-2 convinced enough people at OpenAI that the pure language hypothesis was valid. They just needed more data, more model parameters, and more compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the belief in AGI, plus the recent results from LLMs, necessitates scaling, and justifies building data centres that consume hundreds of litres of water a second, run on polluting gas generators because the grid can’t supply the power (and might use as much power as entire cities), driving up CO2 emissions from manufacture and operation of new hardware, and exploits and traumatises data workers to make sure ChatGPT doesn’t generate outputs like child sexual abuse material and hate speech or encourage users to self-harm. (The thirst for data is so great that they stopped curating training data and instead consume the internet, warts and all, and manage the model output using RLHF.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is all fine, because they’re going to make AGI and the expected value (EV) of it will be huge! (Briefly, the argument goes that if there is a 0.001% chance of AGI delivering an extremely large amount of value, and 99.999% chance of much less or zero value, then the EV is still extremely large because &lt;code&gt;(0.001% * very_large_value) + (99.999% * small_value) = very_large_value&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But AGI arguments based on EV are nonsensical because the values and probabilities are made up and unfalsifiable. They also ignore externalities like environmental damage, which in contrast to AGI, have known negative value and certain probability: costs borne by everyone else right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a technologist I want to solve problems effectively (by bringing about the desired, correct result), efficiently (with minimal waste) and without harm (to people or the environment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs-as-AGI fail on all three fronts. The computational profligacy of LLMs-as-AGI is dissatisfying, and the exploitation of data workers and the environment unacceptable. Instead, if we drop the AGI fantasy, we can evaluate LLMs and other generative models as solutions for specific problems, rather than all problems, with proper cost benefit analysis. For example, by using smaller purpose-built generative models, or even discriminative (non-generative) models. In other words, make trade-offs and actually do engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I think nobody wants AI in Firefox, Mozilla&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla is developing a built‑in AI assistant for Firefox that will be offered as a third browsing mode alongside Normal and Private tabs. They’re calling it “Window AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details are still scarce. Based on Mozilla’s official announcement on Thursday (13th), it looks like a deeper implementation than the existing sidebar that gives access to third‑party chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.). The post stresses the feature will be opt-in and that the user “is in control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a waitlist to try the feature and a Mozilla forum thread inviting people to “help shape” the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that the people who volunteered to “shape” the initiative want it dead and buried. Of the 52 responses at the time of writing, *all* rejected the idea and asked Mozilla to stop shoving AI features into Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether the negative reactions reflect the majority of Firefox users or are just a noisy minority. Mozilla, after all, likely has a clearer view of the whole user base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What strikes me as odd is the decision to position itself as just another AI‑enabled web browser, picking a fight with big techs and better‑funded startups whose users are less hostile (and sometimes enthusiastic) about adding AI to web browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla seems to be trying to wedge itself between those who reject AI and those who want generative‑AI features in the browser — trying to please everyone — as this excerpt from the post shows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We see a lot of promise in AI browser features making your online experience smoother, more helpful, and free from the everyday disruptions that break your flow. But browsers made by AI companies ask you to make a hard choice — either use AI all the time or don’t use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re focused on making the best browser, which means recognizing that everyone has different needs. For some, AI is part of everyday life. For others, it’s useful only occasionally. And many are simply curious about what it can offer, but unsure where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Regardless of your choice, with Firefox, you’re in control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those unhappy have another option: use an AI‑free Firefox fork such as LibreWolf, Waterfox, or Zen Browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Linear Algebra Explains Why Some Words Are Effectively Untranslatable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A modest mathematical framing of language&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A part of me still hasn't recovered from learning that some people believe there is no such thing as an untranslatable word. I've written about why I disagree before, but that explanation didn't satisfy me completely. There was a stronger argument to be made, I thought, but I couldn't put it into words. Now I remember, though: you need to see language as (a little bit) like math. Call me crazy, but I think that language translation is like a change of basis in linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Me making weird connections like this might simply be an occupational hazard. Both my PhD research and my first job had to do with controlling the position and orientation of spacecraft and rocks in space, which means that I spent years juggling vectors, matrix multiplications, and reference frames almost daily. Still, I think it is simple enough to be understood by anyone, so hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You might remember linear algebra from high school. It's that subfield where you write about stuff like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the mere sight of the above is like a punch in the face for you, don't worry. I'm not going to math you to death in what follows. I will only remind you of a tiny basic part of it that I think relates to languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During those same mathematical days, I was also learning Japanese. The language fascinated me for many reasons, like its beautiful dissociation between written and spoken words and its many unique quirks, but I was also struck early on by something a bit more meta: how hard it is to translate things to and from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two concurrent interests made it hard for me not to see a connection. For almost a decade now, I've held it in a corner of my mind without telling anyone, perhaps because I thought it would be seen as too outrageous, but hey! Now LLMs are popular and they literally handle words and concepts as vectors with linear algebra operations, so maybe my analogy isn't that out there. Let me give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Case of Vectors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, a vector is not "a list of numbers" but an abstract object with no predefined way to express it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a vector is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with algebra and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a frame of reference—or, more accurately, a set of vectors to use as "basis" to quantify all others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where numbers come into play. By projecting the vectors against the basis vectors, you can assign them lists of numbers (two numbers each, in this two-dimensional case):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those numbers are the coordinates of the vectors in that basis. For instance, the vector can be read as "half as long as the vector along the direction of , and times as long as the vector along the direction of ."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important thing I want to convey here (and the last mathy thing to remember) is that if you were to choose a different basis, the same vector would have different coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this new basis, the two vectors are written as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, change the basis (e.g. from " &amp;amp; " to " &amp;amp; ") and the same abstract object (vector) will be represented with different numbers. You can do all the same operations with them, like changing the vector's length and direction, calculating the angle between the vectors, and so on, and you'll get the same results in both bases, because they are operations on the same objects. The choice of basis is merely cosmetic from this point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Case of Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's turn to language and see the parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, a concept is not a word or a group of words but an abstract object in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a concept is not very useful in this abstract state. We need a way to write it down so that we can manipulate it with grammar and communicate it to others. We do this by choosing a language that is shared with the receiver of the message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the concept in my head right now, and choosing the English language to represent it, you get this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Going to Tokyo"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where words come into play. By projecting the abstract idea onto the standard English vocabulary and grammar, you can assign it a list of words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those words are the equivalent of the coordinates of the vectors in linear algebra. The way I just wrote it is not accurate, though, because it makes it look as if English only had 3 dimensions (3 words), just like the 2-element vectors were 2-dimensional. English actually has hundreds of thousands of words, so we would need a vector that long to fully represent it, with blank spaces for all the words that aren't involved in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The English language offers its speakers many other words, like camel, frolic, and or, but in this case none of them was necessary to express the idea that was in my mind, so they remain empty () and absent from my utterance of "going to Tokyo".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, similar to vectors with bases, you can express the same concept in a different language. If I chose Italian as the "basis", you'd get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Andare a Tokio"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concept is the same, but now its representation (its "word coordinates") is different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can, in theory, say those two different sequences of sounds in those two languages, and obtain the same effect in the mind of the receiver. The only requirement is that all people involved know both languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cosmetics Matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, the parallel seems plain enough. Sadly, expressing all language in that vector-like format would use up a lot of ink and is not really practical for everyday use. (LLMs kind of achieve that feat, but in a more convoluted and definitely not human-readable way.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I think it is interesting, then? Because "untranslatable" words exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The words that people sometimes call "untranslatable" are terms that have a clear and widely understood meaning in one language, but no equivalent in another one. I gave some examples from Japanese before, and the web is awash with blog posts enumerating curious words like that from many other languages. The key takeaway is that what only takes a single word in Language 1 can only be expressed with some accuracy in Language 2 if you use many words to explain them in all of their facets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote that the choice of basis in linear algebra is "cosmetic", because the result of an operation on vectors does not change depending on the basis. But that is only the ideal, mathematical way to look at it. We humans are not so ideal. We are weak and fallible and sometimes we even stink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which vector representation do you like better between these two?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both represent the same vector under different bases, because I chose a base that has the vector as one of the basis vectors. Here is what the two cases look like graphically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, both representations are exactly equivalent to each other. A computer wouldn't have any preference. But the second representation, the clean one with a simple one and zero, is not only easier to remember and grasp for a person, but it is also easier to handle mathematically. Things simplify easily with it, everything that is multiplied by zero becomes zero, and similarly for the multiplications by one. The calculations proceed faster and with fewer errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that, at least for our feeble organic minds, the choice of basis does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same holds for language. A concept that took several words in English...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in Japanese is a single word: joukyou (上京)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at it in the other direction, a native word in one language is like one of its "basis vectors"—simple and straightforward—but the underlying concept might need to be "spread out" onto several words when applying a different language (i.e. "basis").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arguably, having a compact word makes it easier not only to express the concept, but also to think about it. This is the Sapir-Whorf debate, but I'll leave that for another day. Instead, I want to show you what this means for untranslatability, because there are people who vehemently deny their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Losing in Translation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there are two ways in which this analogy makes it quite obvious that "practical untranslatability" is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, communication is costly, and we don't have infinite time and space to put in all the words that are needed. Even if the word could in theory be explained in the other language, usually it's not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Japanese term mono no aware (物の哀れ) could be rather accurately translated as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;a gentle, poignant sadness or pathos felt in response to the transient nature of all things, a deep awareness of their impermanence that evokes a subtle, bittersweet sorrow and a profound, quiet empathy for their passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a dictionary, perhaps that's okay. But a dictionary is not translation. Translation is about conveying the meaning of full texts, and you can't do that kind of multi-line expansion for every word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so the translator simplifies it to the gist, e.g. as the pathos of all things. This conveys the majority of the meaning and it is usually enough, but it does lose a lot in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly analogous to the data analysis technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where one simplifies a vector by picking only its largest coordinates and disregarding all others. This means choosing a subset of the basis vectors that are more closely aligned with the vectors of interest, and ignoring the existence of the other basis vectors, effectively reducing the dimensions of the data. Translators use a version of PCA every time they (begrudgingly) accept to leave the finer nuances of a concept unsaid for the sake of space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, even assuming you do have time to explicate, using many more words increases the risk of introducing unintended nuances that come bundled with those extra words. This is like doing PCA but selecting inappropriate basis vectors, which introduce lots of small errors in the calculation of the vector's coordinates. Is "sorrow" too emotionally charged in that long translation of mono no aware? Does the use of "passing" unnecessarily remind English speakers of people dying?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You eventually hit diminishing returns: using more words confuses the reader instead of clarifying things further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second problem with translation is precision. Even if you can use many words, and even if none of those are misleading, words are still finite in number. Unlike ideal numerical coordinates, which can take any value down to the finest detail, you only have a small selection of words to convey a given bit of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you realize that the word "subtle" is not accurate enough in the "...evokes a subtle, bittersweet" part of the translation above. Maybe you do want to convey subtlety, but feel that the simple word "subtle" feels too strong in this case. You might try to soften it with an adverb, like "somewhat subtle" or "slightly subtle", but there aren't many other options out there. What if none of them is perfect for your current needs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this sense, language is "quantized": you can jump from one level of intensity of some meaning to the next, but you can't express anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a problem shared by all computers. Unlike ideal numbers, the numbers in a processor necessarily have a finite number of decimal places. So when you want to work with the ideal vector&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the storage limitations of your computer might mean that you have to content yourself with this truncated version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Modern computers can usually handle many more digits than that, but you get the idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphically, it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, AI engineers sometimes intentionally quantize large language models to make them take up less memory, but this tends to make them dumber, because they lose nuance.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With language, like with computers, we're forced to "lower the resolution" of our concepts whenever we put them into words. This happens twice in translated text: once when the author first writes down their thoughts, then once more when the translator transports that already-degraded concept into a different language with different "quantization steps".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Between the Lines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope these rather unorthodox leaps between linguistics and mathematics helped make it almost obvious that some words and ideas are untranslatable in practice. I also hope you don't take the analogy too seriously, because it won't go much further than this. You might be tempted to begin talking about "word matrices" and whatnot, but I doubt it would help clarify things. That kind of advanced linear algebra with concepts might work for LLMs, but it doesn't seem to map to anything intelligible for a human being, not to mention make you any wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides, language has something going for it that doesn't seem to have a mathematical equivalent: what does it mean to "read between the lines"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to pin down, but I think it has to do with the structure and context of the words communicating something that is not contained in any of the words themselves. Perhaps it is the clever use of those "negligible coordinates"—the fringe nuances—of words scattered around the text to produce a collective effect on the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good translator might not be able to exactly translate a given word or sentence, but they might be able to "write between the lines" so that it doesn't matter very much. ●&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things in all of professional sports is the unofficial holiday referred to as “Bobby Bonilla Day.” The short version of it is that Bonilla played for the New York Mets decades ago and eventually bought out his contract in 2000 when they decided they were done with him. Rather than pay the $5.9 million buyout of the contract up front, the team instead made the bonkers decision to negotiate a deferred payment schedule for that amount with 8% interest over the course of 25 years. The result is that the Mets will be paying Bonilla $1.2 million per year every July 1st, starting in 2011 and ending in 2035. And if you can’t make sense of the math on that one, it’s because you aren’t aware that the Mets ownership was one of Bernie Madoff’s many victims, which is why they had to defer the payments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 10th is not Bobby Bonilla Day. But it should be named “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes Day.” The classic spy-shooter turned 25 on that date and, for the exact same reasons we’ve detailed for a god damned decade now, you still can’t buy the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the short of it. Due to a series of mergers, closures, and rights purchases, the IP rights for No One Lives Forever and its sequel have been potentially split into three pieces between Warner Bros., Activision, and 20th Century Fox, like it was some kind of fucking horcrux. I say potentially because nobody really knows who owns what, if anything, when it comes to these games. When one company, Nightdive Studios, attempted to remaster and re-release the game as they’ve done with other titles, along with securing trademark rights to the game which hasn’t been sold in over a decade, all three companies complained that they may have rights to it and may sue over it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of those qualifiers are, again, because even these companies themselves don’t know what rights they actually have. And why is that? Well, because the gaming rights deals were inked before digital storage was widely used for this sort of thing and, well, nobody seems to be able to locate the actual paperwork denoting who owns what. Here’s an example of an exchange Nightdive had with Activision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“So we went back to Activision and, [after] numerous correspondence going back and forth, they replied that they thought they might have some rights, but that any records predated digital storage. So we’re talking about a contract in a box someplace.” Kuperman laughed. “The image I get is the end of Indiana Jones… somewhere in a box, maybe in the bowels of Activision, maybe it was shipped off to Iron Mountain or somewhere. And they confessed, they didn’t have [their] hands on it. And they weren’t sure that they even had any of those rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which didn’t keep Activision from warning Nightdive that it might totally sue if it moved forward with remastering the game. The other companies made similar noises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s a person to do if they want to play this game? You can’t buy it legitimately currently. It’s not even for sale anywhere. And a situation like that, which I’ve stated before, completely breaks the copyright bargain. The only option is, as Kotaku of all places notes, to download it for free from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Downloading games that are available for sale is piracy. It’s illegal, and it’s not supportive of developers and their art. But when companies have gone out of their way to refuse to take your money for a game for the better part of two decades, it’s a very different situation. Look, I’m not your real mom and dad, and I can’t tell you what to do. But if you were to click on this link (link removed by Techdirt due to us not knowing where it takes you) and download both games (as well as spin-off Contract Jack), you’d end up with modernized versions of these classic games, with mods that allow them to work on Windows 10 and 11, and in widescreen. And what better time to do (or not do) this than on the first game’s 25th anniversary?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point (as indeed it was over eight years ago, the last time I suggested just downloading it, to no negative response at all) we have to consider No One Lives Forever to be abandonware. No one is willing to take ownership of it, although those that could do so sometimes mindlessly threaten to intervene should anyone else try to rebuild it for sale. Nightdive were scared off a decade ago, and it’s been sitting on GOG’s Dreamlist since that launched earlier this year (with 87,171 people saying they’d pay for it if they could). It’s far too small of a concern for any of the megacorps who might own it to spend the time and money to work out if they do, but it’s far too big of a concern within gaming history to be allowed to just disappear. Thank goodness for the anonymous heroes running NOLF Revival. I thank them for their service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the only option the public has to play this game and enjoy this small piece of our collective culture. The real answer here is some sort of copyright reform that makes this situation not a thing. If a company, or group of companies, won’t offer a piece of work for sale, can’t be bothered to understand what they own of it, if anything, and have no plans to figure any of that out… then how can this be copyright infringement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So happy “Let Us Play No One Lives Forever, You Assholes” Day. Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Filed Under: copyright, ip rights, no one lives forever, video games &lt;lb/&gt; Companies: 20th century fox, activision, microsoft, nightdive, warner bros. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll be able to play this game legitimately by the time Bobby Bonilla stops making his million and change per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh, a refreshing bit of optimism in these dark times!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IANAL, but I’d say just release and let them sue.&lt;lb/&gt; If they can’t find the documentation during discovery, case dismissed. Maybe even counter-sue for legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then they have an incentive to look for the paperwork. they don’t have any particular reason to go looking right now but if they see money and a lawsuit they’ll assign someone to start digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could be in for a really big payout to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it would be a gamble, and the potential payoff is probably not worth the risk you would be taking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am baffled why we make intellectual property as legally upheld as physical property, and yet we still end up with these areas that are so untouchably gray area nobody can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of physical property gray areas, there are certainly disputed areas, but almost nowhere on Earth do people avoid due to the ambiguity. The only real example I know is Bir Tawil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those NOLF IP “feeling unproductive, might litigate later… idk &amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3” hogging assholes can burn in… molten lava? Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the link in the article is indeed a valid, working dedicated site for hosting “pirated” copies of these games and it hasn’t been taken down in nearly a decade says a lot about how much the potential “rightsholders” genuinely do not give a damn about this series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like copyright law should have stipulations for cases like this, especially considering how long terms are right now – corporations shouldn’t be sitting on copyrights doing absolutely nothing with them like dragon hoards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No-one plays…forever. Well, legally anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; The only games are being played by the corporations, and played so poorly that EVERYONE loses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising — and ironic — vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm B. burgdorferi, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield B. burgdorferi against its host’s immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If B. burgdorferi is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host’s immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was published today (Nov. 13) in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease,” said Northwestern’s Brian Hoffman, who co-led the study with USU’s Michael Daly. “It’s both Borrelia’s armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors for entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and molecular biosciences at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 476,000 people in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Although antibiotics harm B. burgdorferi, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria,” Daly said. “Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and — if not treated promptly — can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient’s immune, circulatory and central nervous systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to understand the role of manganese in Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as “Conan the Bacterium” for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in B. burgdorferi’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “map” revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host’s immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens,” Hoffman said. “Without these tools, B. burgdorferi’s defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese — to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave B. burgdorferi wide open to attack by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“By disrupting the delicate balance of manganese in B. burgdorferi, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection,” Daly said. “Manganese is an Achilles’ heel of its defenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs’ Tick-borne Disease Research Program and the National Institutes of Health. Additional funds were from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An AI-powered supply chain compliance engine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;San Francisco - In Person&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re RetailReady (YC W24), an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine shaking up an antiquated (and yes, unsexy) industry. Since YC, we raised a $3.3M seed round and signed over 15 enterprise customers… we’re officially in scaling mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is the first AI-powered compliance engine designed for retail supply chains. We automate the messy web of compliance requirements between brands, warehouses, and retailers, turning weeks of manual work into minutes of automation. Our platform integrates deeply with warehouse operations and connects with customer systems via EDI, APIs, and flat files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t just build dashboards. We build the nervous system of compliance inside a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a Support Engineer to be the first line of defense when issues arise. You’ll troubleshoot customer questions, diagnose technical issues, and flag deeper bugs for our on-call engineering team, keeping operations smooth across our growing customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll also help us scale smarter by documenting common issues and writing internal + customer-facing help articles to train our AI support model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an in-person role in San Francisco with early hours (5 a.m. – 2 p.m.) to support our East Coast customers in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re an early riser who loves solving problems, thrives in fast-moving environments, and wants to help power the next generation of supply chain tech - we’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is building an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine. Supply chains are still heavily reliant on paper processes and tribal knowledge, causing costly shipping mistakes that jeopardize the longevity of businesses.

        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are my dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was still using Manjaro Linux back in 2019, I got a nudge to try i3wm. It was my first experience with any window manager. And I spent nearly 5 years with it, enjoying the absolute control over my workflow. Nearing the end of 2023, when I finally decided to leave Manjaro (for good), I had a bunch of options on my hand. Fedora looked really promising at that time. But even then, I wasnât sure I was going to be using any tiling window manager. I happily switched to Gnome in Fedora 40. I ran it along with XOrg so that I could make my &lt;code&gt;capslock&lt;/code&gt; key act as a &lt;code&gt;ctrl&lt;/code&gt; when held and as an &lt;code&gt;escape&lt;/code&gt; when pressed
once, using &lt;code&gt;setxkbmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xcape&lt;/code&gt;. But only after spending a few months there,
I realized I missed that finer control at my fingertips. So, I resumed searching
for a newer tiling window manager. I was also learning Haskell at that time, so
picking up XMonad was natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things that I like about XMonad apart from its standard tiling manager features. I enjoy writing the configuration in Haskell. Where ever possible, I try to leverage the benefits of Haskellâs strong type system. Defining keybindings with a strong type system ensures that I cannot go very wrong with it. Using stack for building my configuration allows me to port the entire configuration easily to other systems, which are my various virtual machines. I have split configuration in various modules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;src
âââ Keybindings.hs
âââ Layout.hs
âââ Plugins
âÂ Â  âââ Bluetooth.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Pomodoro.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Soundtrack.hs
âââ Preferences.hs
âââ Theme
âÂ Â  âââ Dmenu.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Font.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Theme.hs
âÂ Â  âââ Xresources.hs
âââ Workspaces.hs
âââ xmobar.hs
âââ xmonad.hs

3 directories, 13 files&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to poke around the config according to your needs, go through Preferences.hs. It contains lots of variables which can be customized like terminal emulator, browser, scratchpads, window gap size etc. It also contains a list of applications which you would like to start automatically at boot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the modularization has turned out to be pretty in terms of categorizing things. I tried writing a few xmobar plugins for my own needs. The guide for writing them was straightforward to begin with. I also wrote my entire xmobar configuration in Haskell itself, keeping this executable in the same project. In the end, the project itself became a one-shot way for an entire desktop environment which I can easily clone, compile and install on any system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1. Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will go briefly over the stack-based setup. The only thing needed is to have a &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; script at the root of your xmonad project. Everything else is simply a
normal stack project with modules and a few executables. I have 2 executables in
my project: xmonad and xmobar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed description and example build files can be found here. My build script is simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh

SRC_DIR=$HOME/.config/xmonad
WM=xmonad

unset STACK_YAML
FAIL=0

cd $SRC_DIR
stack install 2&amp;gt;.log || FAIL=1

ln -f -T $(stack exec -- which $WM) $1 2&amp;gt;.log || FAIL=2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2. Installation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack is a package manager for Haskell projects and it will be used to compile the package. Install stack either via GHCup or your distributionâs package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir -p $HOME/.config/xmonad
git clone --branch release https://github.com/weirdsmiley/xmonad $HOME/.config/xmonad/
cd $HOME/.config/xmonad
./install.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The installation script will install a few fonts and other tools which are default for this setup. It will also write &lt;code&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.Xresources&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete, and you are logged into xmonad, pressing &lt;code&gt;alt+shift+/&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;alt+?&lt;/code&gt; will open up a dialog box containing all available
keybindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3. Diving in&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.1. Layouts and per-workspace layouts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XMonad provides a very easy way to describe various layouts that workspaces can follow. I found it useful to constrain only a few layouts on each workspace. I used PerWorkspace for this. This allows me to only switch between specified set of layouts. So for example, my workspace 2 is my writing workspace, in which I have 3 applications. A browser, a pdf reader and a terminal with a tmux session attached to it. This can simply be arranged as a three column layout. But sometimes certain pdfs may have smaller font size which can be tough to read in a column. If I zoom in the pdf it spills sideways, and I have to use arrow keys or h,l to move left and right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To tackle this, I have another layout with added magnification on top of the three column layout. It magnifies the focused window by a certain limit. And having only these two layouts in my layout set helps me in easily cycling between layouts. I donât have to skip through 4 different layouts which I would never use in this workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.2. Topbar modification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, XMonad adds a border to the tiled window which is in focus. I took this idea from here. This adds a title bar with formatted colors. This looks nicer that having a border surrounding the window. The focused window is colored blue while unfocused is colored black. Also, having the title names in topbar looks nice, and in a way removes the need of using XMonadLogâs application names in xmobar itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.3. Type safety in keybindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is something which I truly adore about XMonad and writing its configuration in Haskell. I can write my keybindings in a functional manner and leverage Haskellâs type system to ensure safety. Arranging keybindings in this way, seems more fruitful than having them represented via strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;myKeys :: XConfig Layout -&amp;gt; M.Map (KeyMask, KeySym) (X ())
myKeys conf@XConfig {XMonad.modMask = modm} =
  M.fromList -- list of keybindings
    $ [
      -- Restart XMonad
      ( (modm, xK_q), safeSpawn "xmonad" ["--restart"])
      -- Toggle fullscreen
      , ((modm, xK_f), sendMessage $ Toggle NBFULL)
      -- Lock screen
      , ((modm, xK_l), unGrab *&amp;gt; safeSpawn "env" myLockscreen)
      ]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each keybinding is comprised of two values of types: &lt;code&gt;KeyMask&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KeySym&lt;/code&gt;,
followed by an &lt;code&gt;X ()&lt;/code&gt; action. If you donât want to set a keymask simply pass a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;noModMask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.4. Submap keybindings and makeChords&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using submaps in xmonad-contrib, I can write a utility function to easily generate a set of keybindings with an added description.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import XMonad.Actions.Submap
import qualified Data.Map as M

makeChords :: a -&amp;gt; [((KeyMask, KeySym), String, X ())] -&amp;gt; [(a, X ())]
makeChords majorKey subKeys =
  (majorKey, submap . M.fromList $ map ((k, _, a) -&amp;gt; (k, a)) subKeys)
    : [ ( majorKey
        , visualSubmap myVisualSubmapDef
            $ M.fromList
            $ map ((k, d, a) -&amp;gt; (k, (d, a))) subKeys)
      ]

soundChords modm =
  makeChords
    (modm, xK_a)
    [ ( (0, xK_a), "open alsamixer"
      , spawn $ myNamedTerminal "alsamixer" ++ " -e alsamixer")
    , ( (0, xK_m), "toggle music playing"
      , getRunningPlayer' &amp;gt;&amp;gt;= player -&amp;gt;
          spawn $ myMusicCtrl ++ " -p "" ++ player ++ "" play-pause")
    ]

myKeys conf@XConfig {XMonad.modMask = modm} =
  M.fromList $ [] ++ soundChords modm&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;makeChords&lt;/code&gt; adds two distinct sets of keybindings, one normal set and
another a visual set, which creates a dialog box when you press the main submap
key. In the example above, the &lt;code&gt;soundChords&lt;/code&gt; submap is enabled with &lt;code&gt;alt+a&lt;/code&gt;,
then you can see a dialog box containing two keybindings with their
descriptions. Pressing either &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; will launch the first or the second
action. The documentation also contains an example which you can read to see the actual code that will be
appended to your myKeys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.5. Xmobar configuration in Haskell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing the Xmobar configuration inside the same project really allows me to keep everything in one place. I create another executable alongside the xmonad executable, in my &lt;code&gt;package.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. And then xmonad launches xmobar in the
startup apps section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;executables:
  xmonad:
    main: xmonad.hs
    dependencies:
      - xmonad
      - xmonad-contrib
      - containers
  xmobar:
    main: xmobar.hs
    dependencies:
      - xmobar
    ghc-options: -rtsopts -threaded -with-rtsopts=-N&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a small icon beside my layout icons on the left side of xmobar. The represent the current layout in a visual form. Try switching layouts with &lt;code&gt;alt+space&lt;/code&gt; and see the icons change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;myXmobarPP =
  def
    { ppLayout =
        case
          "Columns" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Columns.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "MagnifiedColumns" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=MagnifiedColumns.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "Full" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Full.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "Tall" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Tall.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "ThreeCol" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=MagnifiedColumns.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2-by-3 (left)" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeLeft.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2-by-3 (right)" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeRight.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2x3 LT" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeLeftWithTabs.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "2x3 RT" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=TwoByThreeRightWithTabs.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          "Tiled" -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Tiled.xpm/&amp;gt;"
          _ -&amp;gt; "&amp;lt;icon=Unknown.xpm/&amp;gt;"
    }

main =
  xmonad
    . withEasySB (statusBarProp "xmobar" (pure myXmobarPP)) defToggleStrutsKey
    $ myConfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.6. Scratchpads in action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am using 4 scratchpads in total. Each scratchpad is mapped to a keybinding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  [
  -- Open Scratchpad
  ((modm, xK_Return), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "terminal")
  -- Open Kanboard session
  , ((modm, xK_x), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "Kanboard")
  -- Open CalibreWeb
  , ((modm, xK_z), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "CalibreWeb")
  -- Open Anki
  , ((modm, xK_m), namedScratchpadAction myScratchpads "Anki")
  ]

myScratchpads
 =
  [ NS "terminal" spawnTerm findTerm manageTerm
  , NS "Kanboard" spawnKanboard (className =? "Kanboard") doFullFloat
  , NS "Anki" spawnAnki (className =? "Anki") doFullFloat
  , NS "CalibreWeb" spawnCalibreWeb (className =? "CalibreWeb") doFullFloat
  ]
  ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realized that I donât really open new terminals that often because I use tmux (with tmux-resurrect and tmux-continuum). So I remapped &lt;code&gt;alt+enter&lt;/code&gt; with showing the terminal scratchpad, instead of the usual, open a new terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can open up the calibre-web instance with &lt;code&gt;alt+z&lt;/code&gt;, and immediately resume
whatever I was reading.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You misunderstand what it means to be poor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more I speak about being poor, the more I realize how fundamentally other folks misunderstand what it means to be poor versus being broke. The advice folks will give comes from a good place. However, I would like to give some examples to help everyone understand most advice from non-poor folks isn’t helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone has experienced being broke. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding wayys to trim or make things stretch until the next payday. The difference is when you are broke you have some money. You can afford to put gas in your car, but not enough to do that repair. Money is tight, but you can get the basics at the grocery store. You can’t afford to go to the movies, but will stay home and watch what’s new on Netflix. Being broke sucks. You are watching every dollar spent, finding ways to trim or make things stretch until the next payday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you are poor that next payday brings no relief. It is like an endless runner game. No matter how fast you run or how high you jump you can never see the finish line. No matter how tired you are the ground keeps moving. There is no room for errors as the punishment for mistakes is astronomical. When you hit an obstacle you don’t restart from the last checkpoint, you go back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is this mindset from folks that poor people must not be smart. I mean, you’re smart and you’re not poor! The problem must be a skill issue! Learn the skills to do it yourself and you’ll be able to pull yourself up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other mindset is poor people are lazy. Quit complaining and do it yourself! Just get a better job! Get a second job! There’s money out there, you just have to go get it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last is these folks think they understand what it is like to be poor. Hey, I was a broke college student and I get being poor! I had a rough patch, it will pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a van that is falling apart. It needs a lot of work that we cannot afford to do. In the mindset that poor people are unskilled, it appears that I should watch some YouTube videos, get the parts, and do it myself. The misunderstanding is that being poor means you have tons and tons of skills. You have to fix everything yourself. There is never, I mean never, a time you can pay someone to fix it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example folks think, “If the repair at the shop costs $1,000, but the parts cost $300, you can save a lot of money doing it yourself.” You are absolutely correct. Yet, I still need to be able to afford the $300 in parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see the misunderstanding? I can’t make $300 appear out of thin air. I have the skills, I’ve had to fix all my cars myself. I’ve done complete engine rebuilds, I’ve replaced transmissions, I do all my own regular maintenance. The problem isn’t skills, its money. When you are broke, spending $300 instead of $1,000 sounds like a win because you can’t afford the $1,000. When you’re poor $300 might as well be $1,000 or $10,000, you will never afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a matter of time, either. I can’t put aside money each month and then get it. There is never money to put aside. I can’t put it on the credit card as I know I will never be able to pay it. I’ll just have this $300 debt looming over me, increasing with interest every month, mocking how much of a loser I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second mindset: Being lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I have the time to work multiple jobs when I’m doing all this extra work? How do I have the time when in my extra time I’m fixing cars, appliances, the roof, and cooking every meal from scratch?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should I work a second job and never see my wife? My kids? Should I never have any personal time? Should my entire life revolve around money? Should I kill myself for capitalism?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Folks who say things like this have only ever experienced being broke. It is a temporary situation and a few months of extra income will solve the problem. Being poor is not missing $1,000 or $10,000 in the short term. It’s missing $40,000 a year, every year, forever. There is no short term relief. This isn’t a rough patch. It is The Pit in The Dark Knight Rises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“There’s a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth… Hope. Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy… So simple… And like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. I learned here that there can be no true despair without hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is possible to escape. Hell, two people have done it! Why can’t you do it! But you are completely ignoring how many people have fallen to their death trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the general guidance to escape being poor is actually advice for getting through being broke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cancel Netflix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make food at home&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop going to Starbucks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix it yourself&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t upgrade your phone&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all things that will help you temporarily. It will help you get through a short period of being broke. Or it will help you get your spending under control. You have enough money, you just don’t spend it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being poor is you already did all those things. You cancelled all your streaming services years ago. You make all your food from scratch all the time. You never go to fucking Starbucks. You fix everything yourself. You already stretch everything to the limit. That is how you have to live every day of your life, for eternity, with no relief in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last example and is pertinent to our times in the US. A lot of poor folks are having to stand in line for hours and hours to get food at a food bank due to goverment ineptitude. The advice to simply cook at home doesn’t fix that there isn’t any food at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you honestly think people standing in line at a food bank could fix their situation if they stopped getting DoorDash? Going to Starbucks? Fuck off. They weren’t doing that already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are they to get another job or put in extra hours if they have to stand in line for 3 hours to get food? Should they go without food until they get that job and the paycheck?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to step aside and think about the differences between being broke and being poor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent wealth tax increase in Norway was expected to bring in an additional $146M in yearly tax revenue.&lt;lb/&gt;Instead, individuals worth $54B left the country, leading to a lost $594M in yearly wealth tax revenue.&lt;lb/&gt;That's a net decrease of $448M+.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mass departure of Norway's billionaires has transformed into an unprecedented exodus, as the nation's tax administration grapples with one of Europe's most demanding wealth tax and income tax rates. Last year marked a watershed moment in this capital flight, with more than NOK 600 billion in assets leaving the country as high-net-worth individuals increasingly opted for tax havens over their homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phenomenon has caught the attention of global media, with The Guardian and other outlets documenting the steady stream of super-rich Norwegians seeking refuge in more financially hospitable jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The architecture of the extensive Norwegian taxation system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Norway's approach to wealth taxation reflects a sophisticated yet burdensome system that interweaves multiple fiscal obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each municipality wields authority to levy its own tax rates, while the national government imposes additional charges on personal income, net worth, and various forms of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current structure encompasses property tax, value added tax, and capital gains tax, creating a comprehensive framework that has prompted many of the nation's wealthiest citizens to reconsider their residency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Wealth Tax Burden&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The net wealth tax stands at the heart of this controversy. Unlike most OECD countries, which have abandoned such measures, Norway maintains a stringent wealth taxation system. While certain exemptions exist for business assets, the overall burden falls heavily on those with significant net worth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The valuation of assets for tax purposes, particularly real estate holdings, frequently generates friction between taxpayers and the tax administration, as disagreements arise over assessment methods and fair market determinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Flight of Capital&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Norwegian entrepreneurs and billionaires face particularly galling challenges under this tax regime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wealth tax rate, combined with dividend tax, often forces business owners to withdraw substantial funds from their companies solely to meet tax obligations. This creates a destructive cycle that hampers business growth and reduces incentives for domestic investment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The situation becomes even more complex when you consider the exit tax regulations, which insidiously attempt to capture value from departing residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the case of one prominent industrialist who faced an annual tax bill of NOK 175 million despite drawing a relatively modest salary from his business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such disparities between paper wealth and liquid assets have driven many wealthy Norwegians to seek alternatives abroad, with Switzerland emerging as a preferred destination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The European Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contrast with neighboring countries is notable. Not every EU and EU-adjacent country is taking the same approach as Norway and France.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sweden, once renowned for its high wealth taxes, abandoned such levies years ago, recognizing their potential to drive away capital and talent. Finland and Denmark have similarly opted for different approaches to taxing their wealthy citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spain remains one of the few European nations maintaining a wealth tax, though its system offers more flexibility through regional variations and exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Swiss Alternative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switzerland's cantons have become particularly attractive to Norway's departing wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With its favorable tax base and various cantonal incentives, Swiss municipalities offer attractive alternatives to Norway's rigid system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cities like Lucerne actively court Norwegian expatriates, creating communities of former Nordic residents who share similar tax-driven motivations for relocation. The absence of inheritance tax in many Swiss regions provides an additional draw for family businesses considering relocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real Estate and Asset Valuation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The treatment of real estate under Norway's wealth tax system presents particular challenges. Property valuations can vary significantly between tax assessment and market value, creating additional complexity for wealthy individuals with substantial real estate holdings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This disparity affects both residential and commercial property owners, often forcing them to maintain higher cash reserves solely for tax purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Economic Impact and Policy Response&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Norwegian tax administration faces difficult choices as it watches its tax base erode. While property tax and value added tax provide stable revenue streams, the exodus of billionaires threatens significant portions of the government's income.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent estimates suggest that departing wealthy individuals control combined fortunes of at least NOK 600 billion - capital that now resides beyond Norway's borders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Exit Tax Considerations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government's response has largely focused on tightening exit tax regulations rather than addressing the underlying causes of departure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New provisions require departing residents to pay taxes on unrealized gains, with payment periods extending up to twelve years. This approach risks accelerating the exodus as wealthy individuals rush to relocate before new restrictions take effect. Austria, another European nation grappling with similar challenges, watches Norway's experience closely as it considers its own wealth tax policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The global context and Future Implications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the broader context of international tax competition, Norway's experience offers crucial lessons about the limits of national tax sovereignty in an era of mobile capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some European nations maintain certain wealth-linked taxes, most have moved toward more flexible systems that acknowledge the reality of global competition for high-net-worth individuals and their investments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pressure from tax havens and the mobility of modern capital pose existential challenges to conventional tax policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This dynamic particularly affects countries with high wealth tax rates, as they compete not only with traditional low-tax jurisdictions but also with nations offering specialized incentives for wealthy immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why obtaining second citizenship and multiple passports is a crucial diversification strategy in the modern world. Many investors are exploring options like Citizenship by Investment in Argentina to add geographic and legal flexibility to their planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Social Implications and Public Debate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exodus has sparked intense public discourse about social equity and economic incentives. Each tax return season brings fresh reminders of wealthy departures, while policy makers search for ways to maintain public services without driving away the very taxpayers who contribute most to their funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporters of the current system argue that wealth taxes play a crucial role in maintaining Norway's social democratic model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics counter that driving away successful entrepreneurs ultimately undermines the tax base needed to support social programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This debate extends beyond simple fiscal considerations to fundamental questions about the nature of social contracts in an age of global mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Norway grapples with these challenges, its experience resonates far beyond its borders. Other OECD countries watch developments closely, recognizing that Norway's wealth tax experiment may shape global tax policy discussions for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With billions of NOK in assets already relocated and more wealthy individuals considering departure, the pressure for reform continues to mount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Norway's wealth tax thus represents more than a simple tale of tax rates and capital flight. It embodies fundamental questions about the survival of progressive taxation in a world where capital moves freely across borders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the exodus continues, these questions become increasingly urgent, not just for Norway but for all nations seeking to fund robust social services while remaining attractive to mobile wealth and talent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
