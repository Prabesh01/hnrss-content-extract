    &lt;p&gt;Arundhati Roy identifies as a vagrant. There was a moment in 1997, right after the Delhi-based writer became the first Indian citizen to win the Booker Prize, for her best-selling debut, The God of Small Things, when the president and the prime minister claimed the whole country was proud of her. She was 36 and suddenly rich; she could have coasted on the money and praise. Instead, she changed direction. Furiously and at length, she started writing essays for Indian magazines about everything her country’s elites were doing wrong. As nationalists celebrated Indian nuclear tests, she wrote, “The air is thick with ugliness and there’s the unmistakable stench of fascism on the breeze.” In another essay: “On the whole, in India, the prognosis is — to put it mildly — Not Good.” She wrote about Hindu-nationalist violence, military occupation in Kashmir, poverty, displacement, Islamophobia, and corporate crimes. Her anti-patriotic turn got her dragged in the press and then to court on charges that ranged from obscenity (for a cross-caste sex scene in The God of Small Things) to, most recently, terrorism. She began to define herself against the conflict. As Roy writes in Mother Mary Comes to Me, her new memoir, “The more I was hounded as an antinational, the surer I was that India was the place I loved, the place to which I belonged. Where else could I be the hooligan that I was becoming? Where else would I find co-hooligans I so admired?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She has since published more than 20 books, including only one other novel, 2017’s The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. The rest are nonfiction: essay collections, field reports, repackaged lectures, short treatises on politics — and now, at age 63, Roy has published a memoir. Still, The God of Small Things is her best work. Inspired by her childhood spent in a Kerala village, the story about fraternal twins and their renegade single mother glides back and forth in time through atmosphere so rich you can feel the moisture lifting off the Meenachal River. Nothing she has written since has matched its discipline or its immersiveness. Her pivot to punditry changed her work forever. When writing about politics, she favors the heavy use of stats, mixed metaphors, and stuffing every related issue she can think of into the same essay. By the time she was writing The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, that last habit had nearly swallowed her desire to tell a story. The novel, set in Delhi and Kashmir, follows a disillusioned woman who is part of Delhi’s third-gender Hijra community, a corrupt journalist, a Kashmiri freedom fighter, and a woman who becomes involved with all of the above. It buckles with secondary characters and nearly collapses as the author tries to wedge in long digressions about unrelated protest movements. Roy hates being called a writer-activist, which she compares to being called a sofa bed. But most sofa beds work better than that novel does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use another of Roy’s favorite devices, the rhetorical question: Does it actually matter if her writing has become didactic? Her politics have remained consistent. In a 2002 essay, she wrote that fighting fascism “means putting your ear to the ground and listening to the whispering of the truly powerless,” a group that comprises the majority. Unlike many other English-language Indian writers critical of Narendra Modi’s government, she continues to live and work, loudly, in a country where her opinions and her fame infuriate those in power. Treated by the western literary world as a palatable radical emissary, she uses her frequent speaking engagements abroad to highlight the struggles of others. Accepting the PEN Pinter Prize in London last year, she denounced the Israeli “apartheid apparatus,” refusing to blame Hamas for what she called “Israel’s unflinching and ongoing televised genocide in Gaza and now Lebanon.” It’s clear that Roy really cares. And that she couldn’t care less if you approve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite that, Mother Mary is dedicated to the first person whose approval she did want: her mother, Mary Roy. Mary was Roy’s hero and her antagonist, her model and her foil; well known beyond her family, in the 1960s Mary founded a school that would go on to become one of the most prestigious in Kerala. A divorced single mother, she also challenged and changed a law that blocked Syrian Christian women like her from receiving an equal share of their family inheritance. Her death in 2022 pushed Roy to reflect on her own arc in a way she had never done. She could finally appreciate how large Mary loomed. Though Roy has spent little of the past two decades deploying it, her strength has always been as a writer of the visceral, experiential, ephemeral, and small — the charge between two people, the light in a room, the texture of a child’s fear. In Mother Mary, she finally lets herself scale down. Nothing focuses the mind like the need to get your own story straight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mary (who forced her two children, like her students, to call her “Mrs. Roy” so she wouldn’t be accused of favoritism) was in some ways the blueprint for Arundhati: righteous, defiant, and ready to assume a stance of authority in a community that would never have offered it up. In the memoir, Roy admits that she was in awe of her mother’s power, which for her and her elder brother, LKC, was inseparable from Mary’s cruelty. “It was almost as though for her to shine her light on her students and give them all she had, we — he and I — had to absorb her darkness,” she writes. Mary was mercurial and quick to violence. She called 9-year-old Arundhati a “bitch.” She called young LKC a “chauvinist pig.” At report-card time, Mary broke a wooden ruler while beating her son for his “average” results. The next morning, she showered her daughter, whose report card was better, with praise and a rare embrace. Roy is haunted by the shame of this. “Since then, for me, all personal achievement comes with a sense of foreboding,” she writes. “On the occasions when I am toasted or applauded, I always feel that someone else, someone quiet, is being beaten in the other room.” She started to see children whose parents doted on them as “the Mummydaddy people”: “I regarded them with a tangential interest that was laced with a faint protective drizzle of cultivated disdain.” After a terrible row in Roy’s late teens, she and Mary became estranged for years — before, inevitably, her mother pulled her back into the fold. It was both a trial and a relief. Life with Mary was a wrestling match that Roy says she “never wanted to win.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even beyond her relationship with her mother, Roy describes the task of becoming herself in tactile, fleshy terms. Of her struggle to find her voice on the page, Roy writes, “I knew it would not come to me on its own. I needed to hunt it down like prey. Disembowel it, eat it. And when I did, I knew that language, my language, would ease the way blood flowed through my body.” Although she had always been obsessed with reading (in English, at Mary’s insistence), she studied architecture in Delhi, then floundered for a few years until she met an older filmmaker, Pradip Krishen. He would cast her in an ’80s film called Massey Sahib; they began an affair on set and eventually a relationship. Roy and Krishen spent several years making films and television shows together, and through screenwriting she drifted toward the kind of creation she could do on her own. In her early 30s, she began work on The God of Small Things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roy casts herself as the eternal outsider, in part because of how people saw Mary. No matter how far she gets from Kerala, she’ll always be the child of the woman whose family and community rejected her for marrying Arundhati and LKC’s Bengali father, unacceptably outside their insular Syrian Christian community. During the years when she and Mary weren’t speaking, Roy came to self-identify as “Fatherless Motherless Homeless Jobless Reckless,” living “on air” and most comfortable hanging around the canteen near her bare-bones apartment. The obvious rebuttal to her urchinhood is that she was raised by a highly educated mother and is well educated herself, fluent in English, and, famously, a beauty (although Roy writes in the memoir that she’s shocked whenever someone mentions this). She acknowledges her advantages but is more comfortable admitting she inherited Mary’s swagger. At one point before her first novel was published, she and Krishen were struggling financially after a television project they were working on fell through. When a producer proposed a bad deal — he’d pay her a regular pittance in exchange for ownership of everything she writes — she asked him in Hindi, “Mere maathe pe chutiya likha hai kya?” (“Does it say asshole on my forehead?”) Even when she’s broke, she’s still Mary Roy’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some parents hope their children surpass them. Some parents pay no attention (like Roy’s father, who reappeared in her 20s). Then there are those who rage against their children’s accomplishments, clinging to the hierarchy agreed upon when the child was a helpless know-nothing. Roy thinks she knows which kind of parent Mary is. Although The God of Small Things’s success throws a wrench in Roy’s outsider narrative, some things never change. When Roy gave a reading at Mary’s school upon her mother’s suggestion, Mary proceeded to spend the whole time her daughter was at the podium having a side conversation into a live mic. Roy was wounded, if unsurprised. “She presented me and, in the same breath, undermined me,” Roy writes. Still, her success shifted the balance. She knew the independence she had won terrified her mother; believing that Roy’s book would be full of family secrets, Mary checked herself into the hospital to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mother Mary Comes to Me mostly proceeds in a straight line through Roy’s life, but the author can’t resist editorializing or indulging in frequent asides, pausing the action to tell the reader how something will unfold. This character, just introduced, will become a friend of many decades. This action, just completed, will change everything. Sometimes she takes a minute just to be petty. In middle age, Roy will separate from Krishen and buy her own apartment in an upscale Delhi neighborhood. She writes, “Every now and then I kiss the walls and raise a glass and a middle finger to my critics, who seem to think that to write and say the things I do I must live a life of fake, self-inflicted poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At heart, she’s a details guy, and her strongest work happens in close-up. In Mother Mary, she describes how she fell into political writing, some of which brought her to contested territory in soon-to-be-developed dam sites and military zones. Still, these sections lack the blood-and-guts tension of her interactions with her mother. As Mary aged, Roy finally, carefully, began to find a way to relate to her: “I learned to enter her orbit like a clever insect negotiating a spider’s web — to fold my wings and minimize my surface area as I stepped in.” Mary once claimed that Roy was a “millstone” around her neck. Roy couldn’t help but love her anyway. She’ll spend the rest of her life searching for an opponent as worthy as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let’s dive right in: for most of history, we didn’t really know where eels come from. Which is strange, because they’re everywhere—rivers, lakes, oceans. Even now, we only have the faintest sense of where they spawn or how. Their lives remain partly hidden, and that blank space has always invited stories.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Aristotle thought they slithered out of mud, giving the primordial ooze its first big break. Another tale claimed they rose from sea foam, like a grotesque remix of Aphrodite’s birth. Japanese folklore said eels began as earthworms blessed by the summer moon—plausible enough, if you consider being transformed into something both hideous and delicious a blessing. For millennia, our relationship with eels was governed by fables and speculation. Eventually, real science needed to step in.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One spat of scientific interest in eels came at the end of the 19th century. Scientists, lit up by the potential of Darwin’s new theory of evolution, believed they finally had the tools to crack the mysterious origins of eels: how they mated, where they were born, and where they eventually went to die. The scientists observed. They dissected. They experimented. And time after time, they kept hitting dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here’s the story of one such dead end. The year is 1876, in the port of Trieste, Italy—then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In a small lab, surrounded by jars of eels, briny seawater, and plenty of slime, a young zoology student works under orders from his doctoral advisor. His task: to solve the mystery of eels by capturing live specimens from the harbor and slitting open their bellies in search of testes. (The sexual mysteries of eels were anatomical as much as behavioral.) Day after day, he probed and sliced, logging hours at the dissection table. Four months later, he left empty-handed, without so much as a glimpse of a gonad. Upon his departure he wrote: “All I see when I close my eyes is the shimmering dead tissue, which haunts my dreams...” Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That student was Sigmund Freud, who later established psychotherapy as a discipline, using dream interpretation to uncover the hidden sexuality of his patients—truths beneath the surface that, like eel gonads, couldn’t be found through straightforward empirical methods. To overstate it: Freud went a little screwy looking for eel balls. (Or maybe he was already screwy enough to go looking for them.) The psychological case study almost writes itself: the same hidden drives that pushed a young researcher to spend four months searching for eel testes might also fuel a lifetime of theories about libido, repression, and desire. The link is tenuous, of course, but it’s fun to imagine the past 150 years of psychotherapy springing from Freud’s failed eel dissection project.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All these years later, no one has ever seen an Anguilla eel spawn. But scientists think they’ve at least found the place where it happens: a single location on earth where, strangely enough, no adult eel has ever been spotted. Deep in the Atlantic lies the Sargasso Sea—the only sea without land boundaries, defined instead by four great currents. Eels are born, quite literally, in the Bermuda Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mystery cracked a little in 1896, about 20 years after Freud’s attempts, when Italian zoologist Giovanni Battista Grassi found a mature male eel with testes and sperm. He also linked a strange, transparent stubby fish called the Leptocephalus to the eel, noticing they shared the same oddly high number of vertebrae. Long thought to be its own species, the Leptocephalus turned out to be the eel’s larval stage—a dramatic transformation we’d never witnessed and had trouble connecting, since it happens far below, deep in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here’s what we now know: Eels begin as tiny, glassy specs suspended in the Sargasso’s deep blue. They drift for years, feeding on “marine snow” as currents carry them westward. By the time they reach Europe, they’ve transformed into glass eels—their juvenile state that is longer, flatter (but still translucent) with a defined backbone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Then comes the climb out of the ocean. Glass eels push upstream into estuaries, crawling over river rocks and mud to find fresh water for their next metamorphosis. There, they shift again into elvers. The translucent jelly of their body becomes speckled with pigmentation and they develop an insatiable appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After a couple of years of eating they bulk up into yellow eels. This adolescent form is the familiar eel seen wriggling in ponds, drawn up from wells, or fished from rivers. Eels can linger in their yellow form for decades, but eventually nature calls them back to the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In their last metamorphosis, eels begin “silvering”: shedding their greenish yellow color for black and chrome. This is part of their preparation to head back to the ocean to breed. Their eel eyes get larger to be able to see better in the depths. Their stomachs dissolve—won’t be using that on this death mission. And finally (poor Freud), the eels’ sex organs develop to prepare for spawning. The eels swim thousands of miles back to the Sargasso, where they release billions of eggs and sperm into the Bermuda Triangle and die. Their young hatch as tiny glass specs adrift in the currents, and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So the next time you order unagi and salmon rolls, think about how the paths of their lives mirror one another: salmon spawn in rivers, live in the ocean, then fight their way back upstream to lay eggs, while eels do the reverse—born in the ocean, mature in rivers, and return to die in the deep. Upstream versus downstream, knowable and visible versus hidden, lost, and dark.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The life of an eel resists any tidy narrative, transforming from one strange and anomalous form to the next, only to vanish back into the depths that made it. What comes from nowhere should also return to nowhere, safe in its secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escape the Terminal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Built with ACP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bring Any Agent to Zed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're always looking for feedback on ACP, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Looking for a better editor?&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs), particularly the flow of information through the layers and the operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core operations of a Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across three key components: the training data, the tokenization method, and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror those in larger models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal Dataset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns specific connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7 validation words below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Training Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon tastes sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple tastes sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange tastes juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili tastes spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;spicy is a chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sweet is a apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;juicy is a orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sour is a lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the spicy taste of chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sweet taste of apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the juicy taste of orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sour taste of lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon is so sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple is so sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange is so juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili is so spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sour so i like lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sweet so i like apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like juicy so i like orange&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Validation Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like spicy so i like chili&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Basic Tokenization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large vocabularies or unseen words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;List of all Tokens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[('is', 0),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('the', 1),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('orange', 2),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('chili', 3),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sour', 4),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('of', 5),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('taste', 6),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('apple', 7),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sweet', 8),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('juicy', 9),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('a', 10),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('spicy', 11),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('so', 12),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('like', 13),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('tastes', 14),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('i', 15),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('lemon', 16),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('UNKNOWN', 17),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('PADDING', 18)]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simplified Model Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction, also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking input/output representations in the same vector space which is helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly 10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Training and Validation Result&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when prompted with the validation input "i like spicy so i like", the model correctly predicts "chili" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple memorization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Visualizing the Internals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be used for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Token Embeddings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each token before they interact within the Transformer layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forward Pass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the sequence "i like spicy so i like" with the token "chili". Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this sequence in the forward pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are represented by same token vectors. Also, the "spicy" embedding is the same as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this case, the second "like" on the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the model confidently predicts "chili" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the final "like" token evolves to closely resemble the embedding vector for "chili" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely match the representation of the predicted next token, "chili".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attention in Transformer Layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to selectively focus on and integrate information from different positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding context and relationships within the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when transforming each token reveals several details about how the model processes the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these representations are progressively refined through the Transformer layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore, examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions, successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the fundamental processes of information flow and contextual understanding within Transformer models.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I set myself the challenge of writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python1, after writing my SDF donut post. How hard could it be? The answer was, pretty hard, even when dropping quite a few features. But it was also pretty interesting, and the result is surprisingly functional and not too hard to understand!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's too much code for me to comprehensively cover in a single blog post2, so I'll just give an overview of the decisions I made, things I had to cut, and the general architecture of the compiler, touching on a representative piece of each part. Hopefully after reading this post, the code is more approachable!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decisions, decisions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first, and most critical decision, was that this would be a single-pass compiler. 500 lines is too spare to be defining and transforming an abstract syntax tree! What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Most compilers: faffing around with syntax trees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, most compiler's internals look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tokens get lexed, then a parser runs over them and builds pretty little syntax trees:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# hypothetical code, not from anywhere
def parse_statement(lexer) -&amp;gt; PrettyLittleSyntaxTree:
    ...
    if type := lexer.try_next(TYPE_NAME):
        variable_name = lexer.next(IDENTIFIER)

        if lexer.try_next("="):
            initializer = parse_initializer(lexer)
        else:
            initializer = None

        lexer.next(SEMICOLON)

        return VariableDeclarationNode(
            type = type,
            name = variable_name,
            initializer = initializer,
        )
    ...

# much later...
def emit_code_for(node: PrettyLittleSyntaxTree) -&amp;gt; DisgustingMachineCode:
    ...
    if isinstance(node, VariableDeclarationNode):
        slot = reserve_stack_space(node.type.sizeof())
        add_to_environment(node.name, slot)
        if node.initializer is not None:
            register = emit_code_for(node.initializer)
            emit(f"mov {register}, [{slot}]")
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important thing here is that there's two passes, first the parsing builds up a syntax tree, then a second pass chews that tree up and turns it into machine code. That's really useful for most compilers! It keeps the parsing and codegen separate, so each can evolve independently. It also means that you can transform the syntax tree before using it to generate code—for example, by applying optimizations to it. In fact, most compilers have multiple levels of "intermediate representations" between the syntax tree and codegen!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is really great, good engineering, best practices, recommended by experts, etc. But… it takes too much code, so we can't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we'll be single-pass: code generation happens during parsing. We parse a bit, emit some code, parse a bit more, emit a bit more code. So for example, here's some real code from the &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; compiler for parsing the prefix &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; op:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# lexer.try_next() checks if the next token is ~, and if so, consumes
# and returns it (truthy)
elif lexer.try_next("~"):
    # prefix() parses and generates code for the expression after the ~,
    # and load_result emits code to load it, if needed
    meta = load_result(prefix())
    # immediately start yeeting out the negation code!
    emit("i32.const 0xffffffff")
    emit("i32.xor")
    # webassembly only supports 32bit types, so if this is a smaller type,
    # mask it down
    mask_to_sizeof(meta.type)
    # return type information
    return meta
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice there's no syntax trees, no &lt;code&gt;PrefixNegateOp&lt;/code&gt; nodes.
We see some tokens and immediately spit out the corresponding instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed those instructions are WebAssembly, which leads us into the next section...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using WebAssembly, for some reason?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I decided to make the compiler target WebAssembly. I honestly don't know why I did this, it really didn't make it easier—I guess I was just curious? WebAssembly is a really weird target, especially for C. Besides the somewhat-external issues like spending a lot of time confused before I realized WebAssembly v2 is pretty different than WebAssembly v1, the instruction set itself is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one, there's no goto. Instead, you have blocks—structured assembly, imagine that!—and "break" instructions that jump to either the beginning or end of a specific nesting-level of block. This was basically inconsequential for &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, but made implementing &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; extremely cursed, which we'll go over later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, WebAssembly doesn't have registers, it has a stack, and is a stack machine. At first you might think that's awesome, right? C needs a stack! We can just use the WebAssembly stack as our C stack! Nope, because you can't take references to the WebAssembly stack. So instead, we need to maintain our own in-memory stack anyways, and then shuffle it on and off of the WASM parameter stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in the end, I think I ended up with slightly more code than I would have needed to target a more normal ISA like x86 or ARM. But it was interesting! And theoretically, you could run code compiled with &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; in a browser, although I haven't tried (I just use the &lt;code&gt;wasmer&lt;/code&gt; CLI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Error handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It basically doesn't. There's a function &lt;code&gt;die&lt;/code&gt;, which is called when anything weird happens and dumps a compiler stack trace—if you're lucky, you get a line number and a somewhat-vague error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rust compiler, this is not :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What to drop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I had to decide what not to support, since it just wasn't feasible to get all of C into 500 lines. (sorry!) I decided I wanted a really decent sampling of features that tested what the general implementation approach was capable of—for example, if I had skipped pointers, I could have just gotten away with the WASM parameter stack and shed a lot of complexity, but that would have felt like cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up implementing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arithmetic operations and binary operators, with proper precedence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;types&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;string constants (with escapes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pointers (of however many levels), including correct pointer arithmetic (incrementing an &lt;code&gt;int*&lt;/code&gt;adds 4)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arrays (only single-level, not &lt;code&gt;int[][]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;typedefs (and the lexer hack!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, it doesn't support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;structs :-( would be possible with more code, the fundamentals were there, I just couldn't squeeze it in&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;enums / unions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;preprocessor directives (this would probably be 500 lines by itself...)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;floating point. would also be possible, the &lt;code&gt;wasm_type&lt;/code&gt;stuff is in, again just couldn't squeeze it in&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8 byte types (&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;some other small things like pre/post cremements, in-place initialization, etc., which just didn't quite fit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;any sort of standard library or i/o that isn't returning an integer from &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;casting expressions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler passes 34/220 test cases in the c-testsuite. More importantly to me, it can compile and run the following program successfully:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int swap(int* a, int* b) {
  int t;
  t = *a; *a = *b; *b = t;
  return t;
}

int fib(int n) {
  int a, b;
  for (a = b = 1; n &amp;gt; 2; n = n - 1) {
    swap(&amp;amp;a, &amp;amp;b);
    b = b + a;
  }
  return b;
}

int main() {
  return fib(10); // 55
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, enough about deciding things, let's get into the code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Helper types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a small collection of helper types and classes that the compiler uses. None of them are particularly strange, so I'll pass over them fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Emitter&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:21)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a singleton helper to emit nicely-formatted WebAssembly code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, at least the textual format, is formatted as s-expressions, but individual instructions don't need to be parenthesized:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(module
  ;; &amp;lt;snip...&amp;gt;
  (func $swap
    (param $a i32)
    (param $b i32)
    (result i32)
    global.get $__stack_pointer ;; prelude -- adjust stack pointer
    i32.const 12
    i32.sub
    ;; &amp;lt;snip...&amp;gt;
  )
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Emitter&lt;/code&gt; just helps with emitting code with nice indentation so it's easier to read.
It also has a &lt;code&gt;no_emit&lt;/code&gt; method, which will be used for an ugly hack later—stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;StringPool (compiler.py:53)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt; holds all the string constants so they can be arranged in a contiguous region of memory, and hands out addresses into that for the codegen to use.
When you write &lt;code&gt;char *s = "abc"&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt;, what really happens is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;appends a null terminator&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;checks if it's already stored&lt;code&gt;"abc"&lt;/code&gt;, and if so, just hands that address back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;adds it to a dictionary along with the base address + the total byte length stored so far—the address of this new string in the pool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;hands that address back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When all the code is finished compiling, we create an &lt;code&gt;rodata&lt;/code&gt;section with the giant concatenated string produced by&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;, stored at the string pool base address (retroactively making all the addresses&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;handed out valid)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:98)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt; class is complex, because lexing C is complex (&lt;code&gt;(\\([\\abfnrtv'"?]|[0-7]{1,3}|x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2}))&lt;/code&gt; is a real regex in that code for character escapes), but conceptually simple: the lexer marches along identifying what the token at the current position is.
The caller can peek that token, or it can use &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; to tell the lexer to advance, "consuming" that token.
It can also use &lt;code&gt;try_next&lt;/code&gt; to conditionally advance only if the next token is a certain kind—basically, &lt;code&gt;try_next&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut for &lt;code&gt;if self.peek().kind == token: return self.next()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's some additionally complexity because of something called the "lexer hack". Essentially, when parsing C you want to know if something is a type name or variable name (because that context matters for compiling certain expressions), but there's no syntactic distinction between them: &lt;code&gt;int int_t = 0;&lt;/code&gt; is perfectly valid C, as is &lt;code&gt;typedef int int_t; int_t x = 0;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To know if an arbitrary token &lt;code&gt;int_t&lt;/code&gt; is a type name or a variable name, we need to feed type information from the parsing/codegen stage back into the lexer.
This is a giant pain for regular compilers that want to keep their lexer, parser, and codegen modules pure and plantonically separate, but it's actually not very hard for us!
I'll explain it more when we get to the &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; section, but basically we just keep &lt;code&gt;types: set[str]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt;, and when lexing, check if a token is in that set before giving it a token kind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if m := re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*", self.src[self.loc :]):
    tok = m.group(0)
    ...
    # lexer hack
    return Token(TOK_TYPE if tok in self.types else TOK_NAME, tok, self.line)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CType&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:201)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a dataclass for representing information about a C type, like you'd write in &lt;code&gt;int **t&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;short t[5]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;char **t[17]&lt;/code&gt;, minus the &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It contains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the type's name (with any typedefs resolved), such as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;what level of pointer is is (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;= not a pointer,&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int *t&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int **t&lt;/code&gt;, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;what the array size is (&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;= not an array,&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int t[0]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int t[1]&lt;/code&gt;, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, as mentioned before, this type only supports single-level arrays, and not nested arrays like &lt;code&gt;int t[5][6]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FrameVar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:314)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These classes handle our C stack frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, because you can't take references to the WASM stack, we have to manually handle the C stack, we can't use the WASM one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To set up the C stack, the prelude emitted in &lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; sets up a global &lt;code&gt;__stack_pointer&lt;/code&gt; variable, and then every function call decrements that by however much space the function needs for its parameters and local variables—calculated by that function's &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll go over how that calculation works in more detail when we get to parsing functions, but essentially, each parameter and local variable gets a slot in that stack space, and increases &lt;code&gt;StackFrame.frame_size&lt;/code&gt; (and thus the offset of the next variable) depending on its size.
The offset, type information, and other data for each parameter and local variable are stored in a &lt;code&gt;FrameVar&lt;/code&gt; instance, in &lt;code&gt;StackFrame.variables&lt;/code&gt;, in order of declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:344)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This final dataclass is used to track whether the result of an expression is a value or a place. We need to keep track of this distinction in order to handle certain expressions differently based on how they're used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if you have a variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, it can be used in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt;wants the value of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, say&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, to operate on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt;wants the address of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, say&lt;code&gt;0xcafedead&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we parse the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; expression, we can easily fetch the address from the stack frame:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# look the variable up in the `StackFrame`
var, offset = frame.get_var_and_offset(varname)
# put the base address of the C stack on top of the WASM stack
emit(f"global.get $__stack_pointer")
# add the offset (in the C stack)
emit(f"i32.const {offset}")
emit("i32.add")
# the address of the variable is now on top of the WASM stack
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now what? If we &lt;code&gt;i32.load&lt;/code&gt; this address to get the value, then &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt; will have no way to get the address.
But if we don't load it, then &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; will try to add one to the address, resulting in &lt;code&gt;0xcafedeae&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's where &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; comes in: we leave the address on the stack, and return an &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; indicating this is a place:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;return ExprMeta(True, var.type)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, for operations like &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that always want to operate on values instead of places, there's a function &lt;code&gt;load_result&lt;/code&gt; that turns any places into values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def load_result(em: ExprMeta) -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
    """Load a place `ExprMeta`, turning it into a value
    `ExprMeta` of the same type"""
    if em.is_place:
        # emit i32.load, i32.load16_s, etc., based on the type
        emit(em.type.load_ins())
    return ExprMeta(False, em.type)

...
# in the code for parsing `+`
lhs_meta = load_result(parse_lhs())
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an operation like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; just doesn't load the result, and instead leaves the address on the stack: in an important sense, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is a no-op in our compiler, since it doesn't emit any code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next("&amp;amp;"):
    meta = prefix()
    if not meta.is_place:
        die("cannot take reference to value", lexer.line)
    # type of &amp;amp;x is int* when x is int, hence more_ptr
    return ExprMeta(False, meta.type.more_ptr())
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note also that, despite being an address, the result of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; isn't a place! (The code returns an &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;is_place=False&lt;/code&gt;.)
The result of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; should be treated like a value, since &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; should add &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; (or rather, &lt;code&gt;sizeof(x)&lt;/code&gt;) to the address.
That's why we need the place/value distinction, since just "being an address" isn't enough to know whether the result of an expression should be loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, enough about helper classes. Let's move on to the meat of codegen!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parsing and code generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general control flow of the compiler goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blue rectangles represent the main functions of the compiler—&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt;.
The long chain of squares at the bottom shows the operator precedence—most of those functions are automatically generated by a higher-order function, however!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll go through the blue squares one-by-one and explain anything interesting in each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:827)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is pretty short and dull. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if __name__ == "__main__":
    import fileinput

    with fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8") as fi:
        compile("".join(fi))  # todo: make this line-at-a-time?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly I never finished that TODO! The only really interesting thing here is the &lt;code&gt;fileinput&lt;/code&gt; module, which you may not have heard of.
From the module docs,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Typical use is:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;import fileinput for line in fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8"): process(line)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:], defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty. If a filename is '-' it is also replaced by sys.stdin and the optional arguments mode and openhook are ignored. To specify an alternative list of filenames, pass it as the argument to input(). A single file name is also allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means, technically, &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; supports multiple files!
(If you don't mind them all being concatenated and having messed-up line numbers :-) &lt;code&gt;fileinput&lt;/code&gt; is actually fairly sophisticated and has a &lt;code&gt;filelineno()&lt;/code&gt; method, I just didn't use it for space reasons.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:805)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; is the first interesting function here, and is short enough to also include verbatim:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def compile(src: str) -&amp;gt; None:
    # compile an entire file

    with emit.block("(module", ")"):
        emit("(memory 3)")
        emit(f"(global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const {PAGE_SIZE * 3}))")

        emit("(func $__dup_i32 (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 0) (local.get 0))")
        emit("(func $__swap_i32 (param i32) (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 1) (local.get 0))")

        global_frame = StackFrame()
        lexer = Lexer(src, set(["int", "char", "short", "long", "float", "double"]))
        while lexer.peek().kind != TOK_EOF:
            global_declaration(global_frame, lexer)

        emit('(export "main" (func $main))')

        # emit str_pool data section
        emit(f'(data $.rodata (i32.const {str_pool.base}) "{str_pool.pooled()}")')
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function handles emitting the module level prelude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we emit a pragma for the WASM VM to reserve 3 pages of memory (&lt;code&gt;(memory 3)&lt;/code&gt;), and we set the stack pointer to start at the end of that reserved region (it will grow downwards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we define two stack manipulation helpers &lt;code&gt;__dup_i32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__swap_i32&lt;/code&gt;.
These should be familiar if you've ever used Forth: &lt;code&gt;dup&lt;/code&gt; duplicates the item on top of the WASM stack (&lt;code&gt;a -- a a&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; swaps the position of the top two items on the WASM stack (&lt;code&gt;a b -- b a&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we initialize a stack frame to hold the global variables, initialize the lexer with the built-in typenames for the lexer hack, and chew up global declarations until we run out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we export &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and dump the string pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:743)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function is too long to inline the whole thing, but the signature looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def global_declaration(global_frame: StackFrame, lexer: Lexer) -&amp;gt; None:
    # parse a global declaration -- typedef, global variable, or function.
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It handles typedefs, global variables, and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typedefs are cool, since this is where the lexer hack happens!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next("typedef"):
    # yes, `typedef int x[24];` is valid (but weird) c
    type, name = parse_type_and_name(lexer)
    # lexer hack!
    lexer.types.add(name.content)
    typedefs[name.content] = type

    lexer.next(";")
    return
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reuse a general type-name parsing tool since typedefs inherit all of C's weird "declaration reflects usage" rules, which is convenient for us. (and less so for the perplexed newbie!) Then we inform the lexer we've discovered a new type name, so that in the future that token will be lexed as a type name instead of a variable name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally for typedefs, we store the type in the global typedef registry, consume the trailing semicolon, and return back to &lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; for the next global declaration.
Importantly, the type we store is a whole parsed type, since if you do &lt;code&gt;typedef int* int_p;&lt;/code&gt; and then later write &lt;code&gt;int_p *x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; should get a resulting type of &lt;code&gt;int**&lt;/code&gt;—the pointer level is additive!
That means we can't just store the base C typename, and instead need to store an entire &lt;code&gt;CType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the declaration wasn't a typedef, we parse a variable type and name. If we find a &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; token we know it's a global variable declaration (since we don't support global initializers).
In that case, we add the global variable to the global stack frame and bail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next(";"):
    global_frame.add_var(name.content, decl_type, False)
    return
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there's no semicolon, however, we're definitely dealing with a function. To generate code for a function, we need to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a new &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt;for the function, named&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, parse all the parameters and store them in the frame with &lt;code&gt;frame.add_var(varname.content, type, is_parameter=True)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After that, parse all the variable declarations with &lt;code&gt;variable_declaration(lexer, frame)&lt;/code&gt;, which adds them to&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now we know how large the function's stack frame needs to be (&lt;code&gt;frame.frame_size&lt;/code&gt;), so we can start emitting the prelude!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, for all the parameters in the stack frame (added with &lt;code&gt;is_parameter=True&lt;/code&gt;), we generate WASM&lt;code&gt;param&lt;/code&gt;declarations so the function can be called with the WASM calling convention (passing the parameters on the WASM stack):&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for v in frame.variables.values():
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit(f"(param ${v.name} {v.type.wasmtype})")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, we can emit a &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;annotation for the return type, and adjust the C stack pointer to make space for the function's parameters and variables:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;emit(f"(result {decl_type.wasmtype})")
emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
# grow the stack downwards
emit(f"i32.const {frame.frame_offset + frame.frame_size}")
emit("i32.sub")
emit("global.set $__stack_pointer")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each parameter (in reverse order, because stacks), copy it from the WASM stack to our stack:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for v in reversed(frame.variables.values()):
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
        emit(f"i32.const {frame.get_var_and_offset(v.name)[1]}")
        emit("i32.add")
        # fetch the variable from the WASM stack
        emit(f"local.get ${v.name}")
        # and store it at the calculated address in the C stack
        emit(v.type.store_ins())
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, we can call &lt;code&gt;statement(lexer, frame)&lt;/code&gt;in a loop to codegen all the statements in the function, until we hit the closing bracket:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;while not lexer.try_next("}"):
    statement(lexer, frame)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bonus step: we assume the function will always have a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, so we&lt;code&gt;emit("unreachable")&lt;/code&gt;so the WASM analyzer doesn't freak out.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whoof! That was a lot. But that's all for functions, and thus for &lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt;, so let's move on to &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:565)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot of code in &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;.
However, most of it is fairly repetitive, so I'll just explain &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, which should give a good overview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember how WASM doesn't have jumps, and instead has structured control flow? That's relevant now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's see how it works with &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, where it's not too much trouble.
A while loop in WASM looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
    i32.eqz
    br_if 1
    ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are two types of blocks—&lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; (there's also an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block type, which I didn't use).
Each encloses some number of statements and then ends with &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;.
Inside a block, you can break with &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt;, or conditionally based on the top of the WASM stack with &lt;code&gt;br_if&lt;/code&gt; (there's also &lt;code&gt;br_table&lt;/code&gt;, which I didn't use).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; family takes a labelidx parameter, here either &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, which is what level of block the operation applies to.
So in our while loop, the &lt;code&gt;br_if 1&lt;/code&gt; applies to the outer block—index 1, while the &lt;code&gt;br 0&lt;/code&gt; applies to the inner block—index 0. (indices are always relative to the instruction in question—0 is the innermost block to that instruction.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the last rule to know is that a &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; jumps forwards, to the end of the &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;, whereas a &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; jumps backwards, to the beginning of the &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So hopefully the while loop code makes sense now! Looking at it again,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
    i32.eqz

    ;; if test == 0, jump forwards (1 = labelidx of the `block`),
    ;; out of the loop
    br_if 1

    ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;

    ;; unconditionally jump backwards (0 = labelidx of the `loop`).
    ;; to the beginning of the loop
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In more normal assembly, this would correspond to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.loop_start
  ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
  jz .block_end
  ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;
  jmp .loop_start
.block_end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with jumps, you can express things that you can't (easily) in WASM—for example, you could jump into the middle of a block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This mainly is an issue for compiling C's &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;, which I didn't even attempt—there's an algorithm that can transform any code using &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; into an equivalent program using structured control flow, but it's complicated and I don't think it would work with our single-pass approach.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for while loops, this isn't too bad. All we have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# `emit.block` is a context manager to emit the first parameter ("block" here),
# and then the second ("end") on exit
with emit.block("block", "end"):
    with emit.block("loop", "end"):
        # emit code for the test, ending with `i32.eqz`
        parenthesized_test()
        # emit code to exit the loop if the `i32.eqz` was true
        emit("br_if 1")
        # emit code for the body
        bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)
        # emit code to jump back to the beginning
        emit("br 0")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With for loops though, it gets nasty. Consider a for loop like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i = i + 1) {
    j = j * 2 + i;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order the parts of the for loop will be seen by the lexer/code generator is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i = 0&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i &amp;lt; 5&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i = i + 1&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;j = j * 2 + i&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the order we need to put them in the code, to work with WASM's structured control flow, is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  ;; &amp;lt; code for `i = 0` (1) &amp;gt;
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `i &amp;lt; 5` (2) &amp;gt;
    br_if 1
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `j = j * 2 + i` (4!) &amp;gt;
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `i = i + 1` (3!) &amp;gt;
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that 3 and 4 are inverted in the generated code, making the order 1, 2, 4, 3. This is a problem for a single pass compiler! Unlike a normal compiler, we can't store the advancement statement for later. Or… can we?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How I ended up handling this is by making the lexer cloneable, and re-parsing the advancement statement after parsing the body. Essentially, the code looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;elif lexer.try_next("for"):
    lexer.next("(")
    with emit.block("block", "end"):
        # parse initializer (i = 0)
        # (outside of loop since it only happens once)
        if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
            expression(lexer, frame)
            emit("drop") # discard result of initializer
        lexer.next(";")

        with emit.block("loop", "end"):
            # parse test (i &amp;lt; 5), if present
            if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
                load_result(expression(lexer, frame))
                emit("i32.eqz ;; for test")
                emit("br_if 1 ;; exit loop")
            lexer.next(";")

            # handle first pass of advancement statement, if present
            saved_lexer = None
            if lexer.peek().kind != ")":
                saved_lexer = lexer.clone()
                # emit.no_emit() disables code output inside of it,
                # so we can skip over the advancement statement for now
                # to get to the for loop body
                with emit.no_emit():
                    expression(lexer, frame)
            lexer.next(")")

            # parse body
            bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)

            # now that we parsed the body, go back and re-parse
            # the advancement statement using the saved lexer
            if saved_lexer != None:
                expression(saved_lexer, frame)

            # jump back to beginning of loop
            emit("br 0")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the hack is to save the lexer, then use that to go back and handle the advancement statement later, instead of saving the syntax tree like a normal compiler would. Not very elegant—compiling for loops is probably the gnarliest code in the compiler—but it works well enough!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other parts of &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt; are mostly similar, so I'll skip over them to get to the last main part of the compiler—&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:375)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt; is the last big method in the compiler, and it handles parsing expressions, as you might expect.
It contains many inner methods, one for each precedence level, each returning the &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; struct described earlier (which handle the "place vs value" distinction and can be turned into a value using &lt;code&gt;load_result&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom of the precedence stack is &lt;code&gt;value()&lt;/code&gt; (somewhat confusingly named, since it can return &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta(is_place=True, ...)&lt;/code&gt;).
It handles constants, parenthesized expressions, function calls, and variable names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above that, the basic pattern for a precedence level is a function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; def muldiv() -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
    # lhs is the higher precedence operation (prefix operators, in this case)
    lhs_meta = prefix()
    # check if we can parse an operation
    if lexer.peek().kind in ("*", "/", "%"):
        # if so, load in the left hand side
        lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
        # grab the specific operator
        op_token = lexer.next()
        # the right hand side should use this function, for e.g. `x * y * z`
        load_result(muldiv())
        # emit an opcode to do the operation
        if op_token == "*":
            emit(f"i32.mul")
        elif op_token == "/":
            emit(f"i32.div_s")
        else: # %
            emit(f"i32.rem_s")
        # mask down the result if this is a less-than-32bit type
        mask_to_sizeof(lhs_meta.type)
        # we produced a value (is_place=False)
        return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
    # if we didn't find a token, just return the left hand side unchanged
    return lhs_meta
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, this pattern is so consistent that most operations, including &lt;code&gt;muldiv&lt;/code&gt;, aren't written out, but instead defined by a higher-order function &lt;code&gt;makeop&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# function for generating simple operator precedence levels from declarative
# dictionaries of { token: instruction_to_emit }
def makeop(
    higher: Callable[[], ExprMeta], ops: dict[str, str], rtype: CType | None = None
) -&amp;gt; Callable[[], ExprMeta]:
    def op() -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
        lhs_meta = higher()
        if lexer.peek().kind in ops.keys():
            lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
            op_token = lexer.next()
            load_result(op())
            # TODO: type checking?
            emit(f"{ops[op_token.kind]}")
            mask_to_sizeof(rtype or lhs_meta.type)
            return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
        return lhs_meta

    return op

muldiv = makeop(prefix, {"*": "i32.mul", "/": "i32.div_s", "%": "i32.rem_s"})
...
shlr = makeop(plusminus, {"&amp;lt;&amp;lt;": "i32.shl", "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;": "i32.shr_s"})
cmplg = makeop(
    shlr,
    {"&amp;lt;": "i32.lt_s", "&amp;gt;": "i32.gt_s", "&amp;lt;=": "i32.le_s", "&amp;gt;=": "i32.ge_s"},
    CType("int"),
)
cmpe = makeop(cmplg, {"==": "i32.eq", "!=": "i32.ne"}, CType("int"))
bitand = makeop(cmpe, {"&amp;amp;": "i32.and"})
bitor = makeop(bitand, {"|": "i32.or"})
xor = makeop(bitor, {"^": "i32.xor"})
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a few operations with special behavior need to be defined explicitly, like &lt;code&gt;plusminus&lt;/code&gt; which needs to handle the nuances of C pointer math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it! That's the last main piece of the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's been our tour of the C compiler in 500 lines of Python! Compilers have a reputation for being complex—GCC and Clang are massive, and even TCC, the Tiny C Compiler, is tens of thousands of lines of code—but if you're willing to sacrifice code quality and do everything in a single pass, they can be surprisingly compact!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to hear if you write your own single-pass compiler—maybe for a custom language? I think this kind of compiler could potentially be a great stage0 for a self-hosted language, since it's so simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next time, this blog will be back to regularly-scheduled LLM posting with a post about making a small transformer by hand!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Speeding up PyTorch inference by 87% on Apple devices with AI-generated Metal kernels&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Our lab investigated whether frontier models can write optimized GPU kernels for Apple devices to speed up inference. We found that they can: our AI-generated Metal kernels were 1.87x faster across 215 PyTorch modules, with some workloads running hundreds of times faster than baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why use AI to generate kernels for Apple devices?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI models execute on hardware via GPU kernels that define each operation. The efficiency of those kernels determines how fast models run (in training and inference). Kernel optimizations like FlashAttention1 show dramatic speedups over baseline, underscoring the need for performant kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While PyTorch and tools like &lt;code&gt;torch.compile&lt;/code&gt;2 handle some kernel optimizations, the last mile of performance still depends on handtuned kernels. These kernels are difficult to write, requiring significant time and expertise. It gets especially challenging when writing kernels outside of CUDA: expertise in non-CUDA platforms is rarer, and there is less tooling and documentation available&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We set out to answer a simple question: could frontier models implement kernel optimizations automatically, across different backends? Billions of Apple devices rely on Metal kernels that are often under-optimized, so we started with Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our vision: Autonomous kernel optimization for any target platform using frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across 215 PyTorch modules, our results show the generated kernels ran 87% faster on Apple hardware compared to baseline PyTorch. This approach requires no expertise in kernel engineering and can be done nearly instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a preview of what we discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many cases where our approach improved performance by 10-100X&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cases where models surfaced algorithmically unnecessary work and removed it (that PyTorch didn't catch)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The impact of incorporating performance profiling and CUDA reference code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why a simple agentic swarm dominates over individual frontier models&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We included 8 frontier models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, and OpenAI in our analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic family&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;claude-sonnet-4 (2025-05-14)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;claude-opus-4 (2025-05-14)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI family&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;gpt-4o (2024-11-20)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;gpt-4.1 (2025-04-14)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;gpt-5 (2025-08-07)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;o3 (2025-04-16)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DeepSeek family&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;deepseek-v3 (2025-03-25)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;deepseek-r1 (2025-05-28)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of test inputs, we used the PyTorch modules defined in the KernelBench3 dataset. KernelBench contains 250 PyTorch modules defining ML workloads of varying complexity. 31 modules contain operations that are currently unsupported in the PyTorch backend for MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), so they were excluded from this analysis. (We ended up excluding 4 additional modules for reasons that will be discussed later.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;KernelBench Category&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;# of Test Cases&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Level 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Simple primitive operations (e.g. matrix multiplication, convolution)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;91&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Level 2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sequences of multiple operations from Level 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;74&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Level 3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complete model architectures (e.g. AlexNet, VGG)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;50&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When evaluating the agent-generated kernels, we need to assess both correctness and performance relative to the baseline PyTorch implementation (at the time of writing, &lt;code&gt;torch.compile&lt;/code&gt; support for Metal is still underway, so it could not serve as a comparison point. MLX is also a great framework for Apple devices, but this work focused on pure PyTorch code optimization, whereas MLX is its own framework). We also made sure to carefully clear the cache between runs, otherwise cached results can falsely present as speedups.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet, DeepSeek r1, DeepSeek v3, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-5, o3&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Dataset&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;KernelBench&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Baseline Implementation&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;PyTorch eager mode&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Number of shots&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;First approach: A simple, kernel-writing agent for Metal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We begin with the simplest implementation of the kernel-writing agent for Metal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Receives the prompt and PyTorch code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generates Metal kernels&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assesses if they match the baseline PyTorch for correctness4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If they fail to compile or are not correct, an error message is passed back to the agent for another try, with up to 5 tries permitted.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's interesting to see how the correctness increases with the number of attempts. o3, for example, gets a working implementation about 60% of the time on the first try, and reaches 94% working implementations by attempt 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;o3's success rate by generation attempt and kernel level. We limited the agent to 5 tries, which seems sufficient for Level 1 and 2 kernels, but Level 3 kernels may benefit from further shots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at each of our 8 models correctness rates, broken down by whether or not the implementation was faster than our baseline or not:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kernel correctness, broken down by whether or not the optimized version was faster than the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reasoning models are pretty good at generating correct kernels across levels, although the non-reasoning models are also capable of doing this sometimes. However, other than GPT-5, these models are more often generating implementations that are slower than the baseline PyTorch. GPT-5's success at generating faster implementations for Level 2 problems is particularly notable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How did the generated kernels do?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every agent produced some kernels that were faster than baseline, and some of them came up with pretty cool stuff. GPT-5 produced a 4.65X speedup for a Mamba 25 state space model, primarily by fusing kernels to reduce the overhead of kernel launch and improve memory access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some of the optimizations were surprisingly clever. In one case, o3 improved latency by over 9000X! o3 assessed the code and identified that given the model's configuration, the results would always be 0s, mathematically. This was not a trivial realization, but it did make the implementation itself trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were 4 problems, all from Level 2, where the most optimal implementation showed that the problem could be reduced to a trivial solution. Despite the true cleverness shown by the models, we excluded these from our analysis - but in the real use cases with imperfect code, this type of speedup mechanism would be quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One interesting thing to note is that the AI-generated kernels don't actually have to be faster every single time to be useful. For long running workloads, it makes sense to profile different implementations - this could even happen automatically. So as long as the AI-generated implementation is sometimes faster, it's valuable - we can always fall back to the baseline implementation when the AI-generated implementation doesn't work or is slower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's evaluate the average speedup compared to the baseline for each of our 8 agents. Based on our realization above, the minimum speedup is always 1X - this is the case where the generated implementation either doesn't work or is slower than the baseline. We use the geometric mean here rather than the arithmetic mean6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average speedup by model, broken down by level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that using GPT-5 produces an average speedup of ~20%, with the other models trailing. One possible conclusion: we should use GPT-5 for kernel generation, possibly giving it some additional context. This would make sense if all of the models tended to behave the same way - generally finding the same optimizations on a consistent set of problems, and failing to optimize other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't what the data actually shows though! Breaking it down by which model did the best across problems, we see that GPT-5 does the best, at 34% of problems where it generates the best solution. But there are another 30% of problems where another model generated a better solution than GPT-5!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across problem levels, this chart shows which model performed the best (or baseline if none of the models beat the baseline performance).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;An agentic swarm for kernel generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to a key insight: kernel generation should use a "Best of N" strategy. Extra generation passes are relatively cheap, it's human effort and the runtime of the model (once deployed) that are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our flow for optimized kernel generation now looks like an agentic swarm. We have a supervisor, which is simple for now. It assesses the generated kernels across all agents, times them against the baseline, and then selects the optimal implementation for the problem. The ability to time and verify implementations against a baseline makes kernel generation a really good candidate for AI generation - it's much more convenient than some other code generation use cases, because we need minimal supervision to evaluate results on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture of our agentic swarm for kernel generation. In this iteration, the supervisor is simple, but in upcoming work we will extend the supervisor to be more dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's see how our agentic swarm performs compared to the standalone models' performance from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance of the initial agentic swarm implementation for kernel generation, showing significantly improved results compared to standalone agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see this approach gives us better results than even GPT-5 - an average 31% speedup across all levels, 42% speedup in Level 2 problems. The agentic swarm is doing a pretty good job already with minimal context - just the input problem and prompt. Next, we tried giving more context to the agents in order to get even faster kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Adding more context to improve performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What information would a human kernel engineer need to improve the performance of their hand-written kernels? Two key sources come to mind: another optimized reference implementation, and profiling information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, we gave our agents the power to take in two additional sources of information when generating kernels for Metal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A CUDA implementation for those kernels (since optimized CUDA references are often available due to the pervasiveness of Nvidia GPUs)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profiling information from gputrace on the M4.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Apple does not make the Metal kernel profiling information easy to pull programmatically via Xcode… So we had to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We solved the problem by using Bluem's cliclick tool to interact with Xcode's GUI. Our Apple Script capture summary, memory and timeline views for each collected gputrace:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example screenshot from Xcode used for analysis. You can see in the screenshot above that there is a clear pipeline bubble after the ndArrayPooling, resulting in idle time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could only add profiling information to models that support multimodal inputs. We divided out the screenshot processing into a subagent, whose job it was to provide performance optimization hints to the main model. The main agent took an initial pass at implementation, which was then profiled and timed. Screenshots were then passed to the subagent to generate performance hints. The maximum number of shots remained the same as before - 5 shots total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subagent architecture&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to our previous finding that the best model varied depending on the problem, we also saw that there was no "single best" configuration in terms of context. Sometimes, adding just one piece of information - either the CUDA reference code or the profiling information - produced the best result. Other times, adding both was helpful. There were still cases where the pure agents with no additional context performed better than the agents with more context!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best agent context configuration by problem level. We can see that the baseline PyTorch is now only superior to the best generated kernels in about ~8% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are particularly striking for Level 2 kernels. Our assessment is that this is because Level 2 kernels benefit more from fusion than Level 1 kernels. Level 3, on the other hand, may be too complex to generate in a single pass. Stay tuned for some improvements where we break down the problem into more manageable chunks for the agent to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, there were still some good kernels for Level 3. DeepSeek-R1 improved on the default implementation with advanced fusion techniques for a VisionAttention problem. It also showed awareness of Metal-specific features, leveraging threadgroups for more efficient shared memory. While there are still further optimization opportunities left on the table, this implementation was over 18X faster than the baseline PyTorch!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, let's evaluate the performance of our agentic swarm. Previously, we did Best of N analysis across all frontier models. Now we do Best of N analysis across the different configurations of each frontier model (CUDA only, CUDA plus profiling, etc). Remember that generating multiple candidate implementations and testing them for performance is a lot "cheaper" than human experts manually writing the code, or running less optimized models at high volume - so offloading more generation to the swarm is worthwhile if it delivers noticeably better results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overall performance of the full agentic swarm at kernel generation for Metal on the problems tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a great speedup - 1.87x better on average than the baseline, nearly instantly, directly from pure PyTorch code. The vanilla agents only saw a 1.31x average speedup, so adding in this additional context almost tripled the improvement we saw!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the distribution of improvements, we see that the median speedup was about 1.35X and 2 kernels were hundreds of times faster than the original implementation. (As mentioned before, we excluded the 4 "trivial" kernels, which were thousands of times faster by cutting out unnecessary work.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution of speedups for the agentic swarm (215 problems total, 4 trivial kernels with large speedups excluded). Median speedup was 1.35X, (geometric) mean 1.87X, with 2 kernels 100X or more faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results show that it's possible to automatically drive significant improvements to model performance by automating the kernel optimization without any user code changes, new frameworks, or porting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI can take on portions of optimization that a human kernel engineer would do, leaving the human effort focused on the most complex optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, developers can get immediate boosts to their model performance via AI-generated kernels, without low-level expertise or needing to leave pure PyTorch:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Speeding up large scale inference workloads&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are hard at work at pushing the envelope further with this technique - smarter agent swarms, better context, more collaboration between agents, and more backends (ROCm, CUDA, SYCL, etc). We're also working on speeding up training workloads, not just inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this technique, new models can be significantly faster on every platform on day 0. If you're excited about this direction, we'd love to hear from you: hello@gimletlabs.ai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can automatically speed up kernels across any target platform using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" is a paper by American philosopher Thomas Nagel, first published in The Philosophical Review in October 1974, and later in Nagel's Mortal Questions (1979). The paper presents several difficulties posed by phenomenal consciousness, including the potential insolubility of the mind–body problem owing to "facts beyond the reach of human concepts", the limits of objectivity and reductionism, the "phenomenological features" of subjective experience, the limits of human imagination, and what it means to be a particular, conscious thing.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel asserts that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism."[2] This assertion has achieved special status in consciousness studies as "the standard 'what it's like' locution".[3] Daniel Dennett, while sharply disagreeing on some points, acknowledged Nagel's paper as "the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness".[4]: 441 Nagel argues you cannot compare human consciousness to that of a bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thesis&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Nagel challenges the possibility of explaining "the most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena" by reductive materialism (the philosophical position that all statements about the mind and mental states can be translated, without any loss or change in meaning, into statements about the physical). For example, a reductive physicalist's solution to the mind–body problem holds that whatever "consciousness" is, it can be fully described via physical processes in the brain and body.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel begins by assuming that "conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon" present in many animals (particularly mammals), even though it is "difficult to say [...] what provides evidence of it". Thus, Nagel sees consciousness not as something exclusively human, but as something shared by many, if not all, organisms. Nagel must be speaking of something other than sensory perception, since objective facts and widespread evidence show that organisms with sensory organs have biological processes of sensory perception. In fact, what all organisms share, according to Nagel, is what he calls the "subjective character of experience" defined as follows: "An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism – something that it is like for the organism."[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain consciousness via objective, reductionist means. The subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be fully explained if the subjective character of experience is ignored, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a reductionist; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to materialism.[6] Thus, for consciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of experience would have to be discarded, which is absurd. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such a world, each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property attributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel argues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a "single point of view", making it infeasible to consider any conscious experience as "objective".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel uses the example of bats to clarify the distinction between subjective and objective concepts. Because bats are mammals, they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel was inspired to use a bat for his argument after living in a home where the animals were frequent visitors. Nagel ultimately used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both sonar and vision are regarded as perceptual experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and eat insects like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, "our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience", meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them (subjectivism). Objectivity requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the mind–body problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Criticisms&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Daniel Dennett denied Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any "interesting or theoretically important" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation.[4]: 442 For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. Dennett holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments.[4]: 443 He has also pointed out[8] that Nagel's argument and question were not new, but had previously been stated by B. A. Farrell in his 1950 article "Experience", published in the journal Mind.[9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Akins similarly argued that many questions about a bat's subjective experience hinge on unanswered questions about the neuroscientific details of a bat's brain (such as the function of cortical activity profiles), and Nagel is too quick in ruling these out as answers to his central question.[10][11]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Hacker analyzes Nagel's statement as not only "malconstructed" but philosophically "misconceived" as a definition of consciousness,[12] and he asserts that Nagel's paper "laid the groundwork for ... forty years of fresh confusion about consciousness".[13]: 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Schwitzgebel and Michael S. Gordon have argued that, contrary to Nagel, normal sighted humans do use echolocation much like bats – it is just that it is generally done without one's awareness. They use this to argue that normal people in normal circumstances can be grossly and systematically mistaken about their conscious experience.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b Nagel, Thomas (10 March 2005).

"pack/*/start" and "pack/*/opt", you could put them anywhere.  We recommend
you put them below "pack/*/opt", for example
"~/.config/nvim/pack/mycolors/opt/dark/colors/very_dark.vim".

&lt;code&gt;:packadd&lt;/code&gt;.  E.g. depending on the compiler
version:&lt;quote&gt;if foo_compiler_version &amp;gt; 34 packadd foo_new else packadd foo_old endifThe "after" directory is most likely not useful in a package. It's not disallowed though.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;:packadd&lt;/code&gt;.

Including this
generated file in the package means that the user can drop the package in the
pack directory and the help command works right away.  Don't forget to re-run
the command after changing the plugin help:&lt;quote&gt;:helptags path/start/foobar/doc :helptags path/opt/fooextra/doc&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;call foolib#getit()pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vim&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;call foolib#getit()pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vim&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;func foolib#getit()This works, because start packages will be searched for autoload files, when sourcing the plugins.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/core/opt&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site&lt;/code&gt; needs to
be part of 'packpath'. It usually is, but might not be in cases like --clean
or setting $XDG_DATA_HOME during startup. Plugin's subdirectory name matches
plugin's name in specification. It is assumed that all plugins in the
directory are managed exclusively by &lt;code&gt;vim.pack&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; executable of at least
version 2.36. Target plugins should be Git repositories with versions as named
tags following semver convention &lt;code&gt;v&amp;lt;major&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;minor&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;patch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;vim.pack.add({
  -- Install "plugin1" and use default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
  'https://github.com/user/plugin1',
  -- Same as above, but using a table (allows setting other options)
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin1' },
  -- Specify plugin's name (here the plugin will be called "plugin2"
  -- instead of "generic-name")
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/generic-name', name = 'plugin2' },
  -- Specify version to follow during install and update
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin3',
    -- Version constraint, see |vim.version.range()|
    version = vim.version.range('1.0'),
  },
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin4',
    -- Git branch, tag, or commit hash
    version = 'main',
  },
})
-- Plugin's code can be used directly after `add()`
plugin1 = require('plugin1')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt; call.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say, plugin
  named 'plugin1' has changed to &lt;code&gt;vim.version.range('*')&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;vim.pack.update({ 'plugin1' })&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; set to current commit hash.
  You can get it by running &lt;code&gt;vim.pack.update({ 'plugin-name' })&lt;/code&gt; and yanking
  the word describing current state (looks like &lt;code&gt;abc12345&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; set to whichever version you
  want it to be updated.
&lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; - one of "install" (install on disk), "update" (update existing
  plugin), "delete" (delete from disk).
&lt;code&gt;spec&lt;/code&gt; - plugin's specification with defaults made explicit.
&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; - full path to plugin's directory.
&lt;code&gt;{src}&lt;/code&gt;       (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) URI from which to install and pull updates. Any
                    format supported by &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; is allowed.
&lt;code&gt;{name}&lt;/code&gt;     (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) Name of plugin. Will be used as directory name.
                    Default: &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; repository name.
&lt;code&gt;{version}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;string|vim.VersionRange&lt;/code&gt;) Version to use for install and
                    updates. Can be:
&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; (no value, default) to use repository's default
                      branch (usually &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;{data}&lt;/code&gt;     (&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;) Arbitrary data associated with a plugin.
&lt;code&gt;{specs}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;)                                          vim.pack.add()&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
        subdirectory (via &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt;) and update state to match &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;
        (via &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; function)
      making it reachable by Nvim.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; can be not the one actually
      present on disk. Execute vim.pack.update() to synchronize.
&lt;code&gt;{specs}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;(string|vim.pack.Spec)[]&lt;/code&gt;) List of plugin specifications.
                 String item is treated as &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;   (&lt;code&gt;table?&lt;/code&gt;) A table with the following fields:

&lt;code&gt;{confirm}&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;) Whether to ask user to confirm
                   initial install. Default &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;{names}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;) List of plugin names to remove from disk. Must
                 be managed by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to
                 current session.
&lt;code&gt;table[]&lt;/code&gt;) A list of objects with the following fields:
&lt;code&gt;{path}&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) Plugin's path on disk.
&lt;code&gt;{names}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;)                                    vim.pack.update()&lt;code&gt;force&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; via lsp-defaults or
          vim.lsp.buf.hover()) - show more information at cursor. Like
          details of particular pending change or newer tag.
        Execute :write to confirm update, execute :quit to discard the
        update.
&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, make updates right away.
&lt;code&gt;{names}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;string[]?&lt;/code&gt;) List of plugin names to update. Must be managed
                 by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to current
                 session. Default: names of all plugins added to current
                 session via vim.pack.add().
&lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;   (&lt;code&gt;table?&lt;/code&gt;) A table with the following fields:

    &lt;p&gt;After working hard since our Polars Cloud announcement last February, we are pleased to officially launch Polars Cloud. Polars Cloud is now Generally Available on AWS. Beyond that, we also launched our novel Distributed Engine in Open Beta on Polars Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can immediately get started at https://cloud.pola.rs/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that you can fire a remote distributed query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import polars_cloud as pc
import polars as pl
from datetime import date

with pc.ComputeContext(
    workspace="&amp;lt;my-workspace&amp;gt;",
    cpus=2,
    memory=8,
    cluster_size=8,
) as ctx:
    in_progress = (
        pl.scan_parquet("s3://polars-cloud-samples-us-east-2-prd/pdsh/sf100/lineitem/",
            storage_options={
                "aws_request_payer": "true",
            })
        .filter(pl.col("l_shipdate") &amp;lt;= date(1998, 9, 2))
        .group_by("l_returnflag", "l_linestatus")
        .agg(
            count_order=pl.len()
        )
        .remote(ctx)

        .execute()
    )

    print(in_progress.await_result().head)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing the DataFrame scale gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The General Availability of Polars Cloud on AWS marks a major milestone in closing the DataFrame scale gap—the historic divide between the ease of pandas locally and the scalability of PySpark remotely. By making Polars Cloud broadly accessible, we bring to life our mission of delivering fast, flexible and open-source data tools that run everywhere, giving users a single API that seamlessly scales from a laptop to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equally significant is the Open Beta of our Distributed Engine, which leverages Polars’ novel streaming architecture to offer not just horizontal but also vertical and diagonal scaling strategies. This design directly addresses the cost, complexity and performance tradeoffs users face today, while making high-performance compute broadly accessible. Together, these launches represent a step-change: remote execution that feels native, distribution without friction, and an architecture built to meet the future of large-scale data processing head-on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. What is Polars Cloud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polars Cloud is a managed data platform that enables you to run Polars queries remotely in the cloud at scale. We will manage the cloud infrastructure and the scaling. Besides remote execution, Polars Cloud offers different scaling strategies, where distributed is most important. Our distributed engine uses our OSS streaming engine on the workers. This ensures we stay committed in making OSS Polars better as we will become one of the direct users. Because of Polars’ strength in vertical compute, Polars’ distributed offers not only horizontal, but also diagonal scaling strategies. Here we have a single big worker for tasks that would be better off on a beefy single node and would not benefit from the shuffling overhead. Polars Cloud will allow you to choose the best scaling strategy that fits your use case, offering one API for any scale, meaning you can reduce cost, time, and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about Polars Cloud in our initial announcement post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Polars Distributed Engine in Public Beta&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our distributed engine is available in Public Beta. We are confident that we achieved a state where our distributed engine is useful and in some cases even one of the best options available. There are of course features we haven’t supported in a distributed manner yet, in that case we will automatically fall back to a single node for that operation. Among many other operations, we can run our PDS-H benchmark fully distributed. If you want to stay updated of what our distributed engine is capable of, keep an eye on the tracking issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where I think our distributed engine shines, is combining partitionable queries with order dependent data processing like in this query below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;result = (
    trades.group_by_dynamic(
        "time",
        every="1m",
        group_by="symbol"
    ).agg(
        avg_price=pl.col("price").mean(),
        total_size=pl.col("size").sum(),
        interval_start=pl.col("time"),
    ).join_asof(
        fairs,
        left_on="interval_start",
        right_on="time",
        by="symbol",
        strategy="backward"
    ).select(
        "symbol",
        "interval_start",
        "avg_price",
        "total_size",
        "fair_value"
    )
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This query really combines the power of Polars’ single node execution with the scalability of Polars’ distributed. It can horizontally partition over symbols and then utilize Polars’ fast query engine to process the partitions on powerful workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Near future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features that will land soon are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On premise support&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We have begun working on supporting the Polars Cloud distributed architecture on premise. We expect to onboard the first clients in the coming months. Are you interested in on-premise Polars Cloud, contact us via the form below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Live cluster dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The current version of Polars Cloud has a dashboard that shows you summaries of your queries, clusters, vCPU etc. The cluster dashboard we are building will have a direct connection to your cluster, allowing us to show much more information. And because Polars streaming executor is written from scratch, we can add custom tracing that can give you deep insights in the operations that your queries spend time and how much utilization it has at any point in time. The possibilities here are very exciting to me as our vertical integration means we have access to all the information in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Orchestration&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we are building a data platform, as minimal version of task orchestration cannot be left out. We don’t aim to replace tools like Airflow or Prefect, but we do want to offer you the option to schedule your queries with Polars Cloud alone. Note that we believe in strong integration with other tools and have therefore chosen for a Polars Cloud client that can directly be used with Polars OSS and popular orchestration tools.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Autoscaling&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we can scale both vertically and horizontally with heterogenous worker sizes, we have unique scaling opportunities. We plan to land vertical and diagonal (where the big worker scales) autoscaling soon. Later we will expand that to horizontal autoscaling as well.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Catalog support&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our early design partners informed us that most users were using iceberg to load their data. Since then we’ve made a large effort to make our iceberg support native and distributed. Besides the iceberg table format, we will also expose a catalog so that users can organize their datasets easier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multi-region&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Initially we launched in the US East region only. This gives us acceptable latencies for the US and western Europe. We are going to launch multi-region as soon as possible so that all regions will experience minimal latencies.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for updates. We will follow up with more blogs and features in the coming weeks and if you have any feedback, track our client repo for posting issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Title: The law of copyright&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author: William Wordsworth&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Release date: September 3, 2025 [eBook #76806]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Language: English&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original publication: London: Thomas J. Wise, 1916&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Credits: Charlene Taylor, Quentin Campbell and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; THE&lt;lb/&gt; LAW OF COPYRIGHT &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BY&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;William Wordsworth&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LONDON&lt;lb/&gt; PRINTED FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION&lt;lb/&gt; 1916 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[5]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE Copyright Act referred to by Wordsworth in the following document was presented to the House of Commons for the first time on April 18th, 1838, the day upon which the poet addressed his open letter to Serjeant Talfourd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The letter appeared in The Morning Post of April 23rd, 1838, and had apparently escaped all notice until I chanced upon it recently when searching a file of the paper for any stray writing of Wordsworth’s.[1] Prefixed to the text of the letter was the following editorial comment:—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We feel very sincere pleasure in having been selected as the medium for giving to the public Mr. Wordsworth’s sentiments concerning Serjeant Talfourd’s proposed Bill for the amendment of the law of copyright. It is a source of additional gratification to us that the opinions of such a man as Mr. Wordsworth are so completely in accordance with those we have already on several occasions endeavoured to impress on the attention of our readers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[6]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he applied himself to the composition of the present letter, Wordsworth was for the second time employing his pen in support of Talfourd’s Bill. An earlier letter, dated April 12th, 1838, addressed to the Editor of The Kendal Mercury, had appeared in the columns of that paper on April 16th, 1838, over the pseudonymous initials “A. B.” This earlier letter is already well known, and is included in the Prose Works of William Wordsworth, edited by William Knight, 1896, Vol. ii, pp. 375–382. Its successor, now rescued from its obscurity in a dusty file of an old newspaper, should henceforth find a place beside it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;T. J. W.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; 25, Heath Drive,&lt;lb/&gt; Hampstead, N.W. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] In view of the number of contributions made by Wordsworth to The Morning Post (among which The Convict, which brightened its pages on December 14th, 1797, is by far the most important) it is curious to recall the following statement which occurs in a letter addressed by him to Daniel Stuart:—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I am quite certain that nothing of mine ever appeared in ‘The Morning Post,’ except a very, very few sonnets upon political subjects, and one poem called ‘The Farmer of Tilsbury Vale,’ but whether this appeared in ‘The Morning Post’ or ‘The Courier,’ I do not remember.” [The poem cited did appear in The Morning Post on July 21st, 1800.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[7]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Rydal Mount, &lt;lb/&gt; April 18th, 1838.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Dear Sir,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A strong opposition, which has manifested itself by public meetings and petitions to the House of Commons, having started up among printers, publishers, and others to your Bill for amending the law of copyrights, and no other like counter-movement being made by authors on their part, it has been suggested to me, from quarters entitled to great respect, that it might be of service if, along with a most distinguished literary friend, I should present a petition to Parliament, praying that the Bill may pass, or at least one in favour of its principle. This compliment has no doubt been paid me as one among the oldest of living writers, and one therefore whose heirs must, in course of nature, be injured sooner than those of younger men, if the proposed measure be rejected. You will not be surprised if I feel some scruple in taking a step, though so well recommended, on account of an aversion to appear prominently in any public question, and because I am loth to think so unfavourably of Parliament as to deem that it requires petitions from authors as a ground for granting them a privilege, the justice of which is so obvious. I [8] cannot bring myself to suppose that the mere shadows of argument advanced by printers and publishers against the claims of a class to whom they owe the respectability of their condition, if not their very existence, should avail with any intelligent and disinterested assembly. Yet further am I averse thus to petition Parliament, because I would not ask as an individual suppliant, or with a single associate, what in equity I consider to be the right of a class, and for a much longer period than that defined in your Bill—for ever. Such right, as you have stated in your admirable speech, was acknowledged by the common law of England; and let them who have cried out so loudly against the extension of the term as is now proposed show cause why that original right should not be restored. The onus clearly rests with them to do so; but they have not attempted it, and are glad to take shelter under the statute law as it now stands, which is a composition or compromise between two opinions; the extreme point of one being, that, by giving his thoughts to the world, an author abandons all right to consider the vehicle as private property; and of the other, that he has the right in perpetuity, that descends to his heirs, and is transferable to those to whom he or they may assign it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[9]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This right I hold to be more deeply inherent in that species of property than in any other, though I am aware that many persons, perceiving wherein it differs from acquisitions made in trade and commerce, &amp;amp;c., have contended that the law in respect to literature ought to remain upon the same footing as that which regards the profits of mechanical inventions and chemical discoveries; but that this is an utter fallacy might easily be proved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the considerations above stated I decline to petition, as suggested, and content myself, in the silence of others better entitled to speak, with this public declaration of my judgment, so that at least, my dear Sir, you may not be liable to be treated as a volunteer intruding without wish or sanction openly expressed by any one of the class whose rights and interests you have so much to your honour stepped forward to maintain. Here this letter shall close, its purpose being answered, for no general arguments from me, and no statement of facts belonging to my own case, and which have come to my knowledge with respect to my illustrious friends Coleridge, Scott, Southey, and others, would avail to produce conviction where that has not been effected by your unrivalled speech made upon your first introduction of the Bill into the [10]House of Commons, and by reasonings which have lately been set forth with great ability by writers in the public journals, who were more at liberty to enter into details than you could be while treating the subject before Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should your Bill be overborne, which I cannot allow myself to fear, by the interested opposition now at work, justice, nevertheless, sooner or later, must triumph; and at all events the respect and gratitude which authors feel towards you and your coadjutors upon this occasion will be cherished by them to the last hour of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I have the honour to be,&lt;lb/&gt; My dear Sir,&lt;lb/&gt; Faithfully yours,&lt;lb/&gt; William Wordsworth.&lt;lb/&gt; To&lt;lb/&gt; Serjeant Talfourd, M.P. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;30 minutes with a stranger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two people are volunteers for a research project. Letâs call them Kate and Dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They donât know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers instructed them to get on this video call and talk to their partner for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They could talk about whatever they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this story, weâll go through 30 minutes of conversation between the people you see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are a subset of nearly 1,700 conversations between about 1,500 people as part of a research project called the CANDOR corpus. The goal was to gather a huge amount of data to spur research on how we converse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on a person to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These conversations paired people across demographics, includingâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Age&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Race&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Educational attainment&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political ideology&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the conversation began, participants were asked how they felt. Most said they felt just average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then they were paired up and the conversation began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the conversation, many people said they felt the same or worse than before the call!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâve gotten quite good at being with people who are similar to us. We often live near people of the same race and class. The education system funnels us into the same schools and similar jobs. Online algorithms group us with like-minded people. These relationships are called âbondingâ social capitalâa term popularized by Robert Putnam in his landmark 2000 book, Bowling Alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Putnam also pointed out that what weâre missing is âbridgingâ social capitalârelationships with people unlike us. Most of our friends are of the same race and class as we are. We have the same political views as most of our friends. And the number of people who say they trust others has been decreasing for generations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Americans who say most people can be trusted&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That might contribute to why we really donât want to talk to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014 study, researchers conducted a series of experiments on Illinois trains and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some commuters were told to keep to themselves during their trip; these participants predicted the isolation would give them a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other commuters were told to talk to strangers; these participants predicted they would have a negative experience. They assumed strangers wouldnât want to talk to them, that strangers wouldnât like them, and that they would have trouble maintaining a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, what if the person you approach gets angry? What if they accuse you of harassing them? What if they just think youâre weird?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hank, 38, held a beer and vaped during this conversation. He told Faith, 20, that he recently made four pounds of shredded chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led to a conversation about how he used to be a chef, but he couldnât imagine going back to that job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RaÃºl, 43, downplayed the seriousness of Covid-19 at the start of this call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paige, 28, said she used to work at a senior living facility and that people didnât care enough about Covid-19 because it mostly kills old people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prompted a conversation about eldercare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre now about 13 minutes into the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the conversation, most people felt the same as they did before the call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But letâs see how their moods changed as the conversation progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the middle of the conversation, a huge portion of people reported feeling better than at the start of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dawn is now telling Kate about why she decided to go into teaching, after getting some hints that Kate is a college professor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 2014 study on Illinois trains and buses, researchers followed up with people who were asked to talk to strangersâthe people who predicted they wouldnât enjoy the experience. What these participants reported back was almost no rejections, pleasant conversations, and an overall positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This phenomenon has been replicated in several experiments. Whether itâs interacting with strangers in a scavenger hunt, meeting new people in a college dorm, or chatting up a barista, researchers have repeatedly found that people donât think theyâll enjoy interacting with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after the interaction, participants tend to say it was a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic, the activity people missed most were things like going to restaurants, the gym, church, and the barbershopâplaces where weâre around strangers and acquaintances, or âweak ties.â We normally have between 11 and 16 interactions with weak ties each day, but devoid of these spontaneous opportunities, only 15% of Americans said they made a new acquaintance during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I watched the entirety of many conversations. (I canât publish the videos because of privacy concerns.) I was surprised how many of these conversations touched on intimate topicsâthings they might not even tell their friends or family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dawn started telling Kate about what kind of teacher she wants to be, largely based on her experiences of the education system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every conversation went smoothly. Several conversations were derailed by a comment that turned off the other person, and caused the conversation to grind to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But those interactions were rare. In most conversations, people enjoyed hearing about their partnerâs life and sharing their own livesâeven when they had very little in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre nearing the end of the 30-minute conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs how participants felt in the middle of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the conversation, participants were asked how they felt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of the call, the large majority of people said they felt better than when the conversation began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs how much positive feelings increased on average in all 1,700 conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;To what extent do you feel positive feelings or negative feelings?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve sorted the conversations by the age gap of the conversation partnersââ smaller age gaps at the top, â bigger age gaps at the bottom. People enjoyed talking to people, young and old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Positive feeling, by the age gap of conversation partner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Iâve put conversations between people of â different races at the top and â same races at the bottom. Interracial conversations tended to lead to positive experiences about as much as they did for people of the same race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Positive feeling, by whether conversation partner is the same race&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And most conversations between people with the â same political ideology and â differing political ideologies also had similar outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Positive feeling, by how different the conversation partnerâs politics are&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social trust is critical for us to tackle some of the biggest problems ahead of us: the erosion of democracy, the emergence of AI, our warming planet, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a 2021 study, researchers looked at why social trust has decreased on an individual level. What they found was that income dissatisfaction, our experience of losing a job, and our decreasing confidence in political institutions account for most of the decline in trust. In short, weâve created a world that is precarious and unstable for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel this, too. Iâm scared by the big and small things happening in our world. I feel my environment crumbling around me, my sense of safety waning. Iâve looked at homes for sale in remote areas where I can disappear with my friends and familyâwhere I donât have to rely on strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of these conversations, several participants seemed to realize that they may never see their conversation partner again, and had to say their bittersweet goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was taking the subway to work when a 16-year-old boy slipped on the subway platform and hit his chin on the ground. He stumbled onto the train and stood next to me. I kept my earbuds in and tried to convince myself this wasnât my problem. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw that heâd split open his chin; blood and tears were gushing down his face. I looked around the train for someone else to helpâmaybe someone who works with kids. No one even looked up. So I grabbed some tissues from my backpack, turned to him, and told him to hold it against his chin. He was in shock. I tried to calm him down and told him to go to the nurseâs office when he got to school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All I could think was: What if that was me? Who would help me? Would everyone stand around like theyâre doing now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I ran out of tissues to stop this kidâs bleeding, people on the train noticed and handed me disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and bandages. We were able to stop the bleeding. When I got off the train, another stranger got up and stood by his side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When weâre wounded, we donât trust the people around us. We shelter away because we think itâs the only way to be safe. We let strangers suffer because, in this emotional state, everyone is a threat. That means itâs hard to work with others to build the world we want. Weâre left to hunker down for the inevitable dystopia that is to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I donât want to live in that world. I want to feel safe. I want to help others to feel safe. And I want people to do the same for meâregardless of whether Iâm a stranger or not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Melvynâs passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions. Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having presented well over 1,000 episodes of the much-loved BBC Radio 4 series, Melvyn Bragg has made the decision to step down from In Our Time following the series which aired earlier this year. Melvyn has presented every episode of In Our Time since the series first launched in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Our Time is regularly one of the BBCâs most listened to on-demand programmes around the world, its appeal spanning generations. It is one of BBC Sounds' most popular podcasts amongst under 35s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last quarter of a century, Melvyn has skilfully led conversations about everything from the age of the Universe to âZenobiaâ, Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. He has welcomed the company of the brightest and best academics in their fields, sharing their passion and knowledge with a fascinated audience right around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he will be much missed on In Our Time, Melvyn will continue to be a friend of Radio 4 with more to come to celebrate his extraordinary career, and a new series in 2026 (details to be announced soon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melvyn Bragg says: "For a programme with a wholly misleading title which started from scratch with a six-month contract, it's been quite a ride! I have worked with many extremely talented and helpful people inside the BBC as well as some of the greatest academics around the world. It's been a great privilege and pleasure. I much look forward to continuing to work for the BBC on Radio 4. Thank you for listening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melvyn first joined the BBC in 1961 as a general trainee. His BBC career has spanned the World Service, a ten-year stint presenting Radio 4's Start the Week from 1988 - 1998 as well as numerous arts and culture programmes. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy and was given a Peerage in 1998 and a Companion of Honour in 2017. Melvyn will continue to work with the BBC on future projects which are yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Davie, BBC Director General, says: âMelvynâs passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions. Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century. He leaves behind not just an extraordinary body of work, but a gold standard of broadcasting and interviewing excellence that will inspire generations to come.â&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohit Bakaya, Director of Speech and Controller of BBC Radio 4 says: "Melvyn has been part of the heartbeat of Radio 4 for over three decades. His fierce intellect, coupled with a wonderful curiosity and extraordinary passion for knowledge marks him out as one of the broadcasting greats. Though we will miss him on In Our Time, he leaves behind a unique legacy: the treasure trove of over 1,000 archive episodes, which are a wonderful resource for all those with a love of learning. I look forward to working with him on new projects for Radio 4.â&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark the end of an era, later this year Radio 4 will be airing some of Melvynâs most cherished episodes and there will also be a curated selection on BBC Sounds chosen by some of In Our Time's most notable fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Our Time will be back on Radio 4 with a new presenter who will be announced in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melvyn Bragg was born in Wigton, Cumbria in 1939. He went to the local Grammar School and then to Wadham College, Oxford. He joined the BBC in 1961, and published his first novel For Want of a Nail in 1965. By that time he had become a Director on Huw Wheldonâs Arts programme Monitor. He worked with Ken Russell on The Debussy Film and again on The Music Lovers starring Glenda Jackson, and Isadora starring Vanessa Redgrave; he wrote the screenplay for Jesus Christ Superstar and for Play Dirty starring Michael Caine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left the BBC and continued to write novels which include The Hired Man (Time Life Silver PEN Award), The Soldierâs Return (WH Smith Literary Award), Without A City Wall (Mail on Sunday John Llewellyn Rhys Prize), A Place In England, Son of War and Crossing The Lines (all three were nominated for The Man Booker Prize), Now Is The Time(Parliamentary Book Award 2016). Howard Goodall wrote a successful musical based on The Hired Man. There have also been non-fiction books â The Adventure of English, The Impact of The King James Bible, On Giantsâ Shoulders, Rich: The Life of Richard Burton, William Tyndale: A Very Brief History. Most of his novels are set in his native Cumbria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1977 he started The South Bank Show for LWT which he edited and presented for Sky Arts. He has presented the Radio 4 programme on Science, History and Religion, In Our Time, since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy. He was given a Peerage in 1998 and a Companion of Honour in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RB2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Follow for more&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Latest from the Media Centre&lt;/head&gt;All news&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Search by Tag:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tagged with Radio 4 Radio 4&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tagged with BBC Sounds BBC Sounds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tagged with Latest News Latest News&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Users across multiple Eastern European countries reported a significant and ongoing outage affecting a suite of Google services, causing widespread disruption to both work and daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reports began flooding into downdetector.com and social media platforms around from users in Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece and other Eastern European countries. The issues appear to be widespread and are affecting core Google products.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which Services Were Impacted?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The outage did not seem to be universal for all Google services, but the affected apps were critical to many:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list style="list-style-type: square;" rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;YouTube: Users experienced an inability to load videos, with many seeing error messages or an endless loading loop. Both the website and mobile app were affected.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Google Maps: The service was failing to load map data, search for locations, or calculate routes, leaving travellers and commuters without navigation assistance.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Google Search: In a particularly impactful failure, the core Google Search engine was returning error messages or failing to complete searches for a significant number of users.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Gmail: Some users were reporting issues with sending and receiving emails, though this appeared to be less consistent than the other outages.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Google Drive: Access to cloud-stored documents and files was also disrupted for many.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The common thread among error messages was a "5xx server error" – a type of error that indicates a problem on Google's end, not with the user's individual internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, users can use other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Brave Search.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a developing story. We will update this article with more information as it becomes available, including an official response from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite color has changed throughout my life, cycling through the entire spectrum of visible light and beyond. I don’t remember when blue was the chosen one, exactly; maybe when I was 13 or so. After that, yellow, purple, orange, green, and pink occupied the top spot for various periods. Blue never made a comeback. I saw it as a banal, common color. After all, the sky is made of it, and the sky is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I realized when compiling the tech tree that blue is the most fascinating color, because it is the hardest of the common colors to create artificially.1 You can’t just take a piece of the sky and put it into a painting. And blue pigments are fairly rare in minerals, plants, and animals. So blue had to be invented, time and time again, from 4000 BC to the 21st century. It is the most technological color, and I’m willing to claim that this is why it is usually, in science fiction and elsewhere, used to represent the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of blue starts with indigo. It is an organic dye made from plants in the Indigofera genus, which grow throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The first known traces of indigo dye come from the New World, in ancient Peru, 6,000 years ago, using Indigofera suffruticosa, or anil.2 In the Old World, it was known from Africa to East Asia, but became particularly associated with India (hence indi-go), where Indigofera tinctoria was domesticated. Indigo soon became a luxury, traded from India to Greco-Roman and then medieval Europe, where the same blue dye could only be made from a less productive plant, woad or Isatis tinctoria. Eventually the “blue gold” became an important colonial crop in the Caribbean and was part of the story of slavery, next to sugar, tobacco, and cotton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before indigo was a thing in the Old World (that started circa 2400 BC), the Egyptians had already become obsessed with the color blue. Besides the sky, it was available in the form of semiprecious stones like turquoise and lapis lazuli, cobalt oxide (more on that later), as well as the mineral azurite, which they mined in Sinai and the Eastern Desert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azurite would later enjoy a fruitful career as the main blue pigment in European painting, but to the Egyptians it was costly, and besides it isn’t the most stable blue color: it degrades and fades when in contact with air. And so they created the first synthetic pigment in history: Egyptian blue. The oldest evidence of it is in a bowl dated to 3250 BC. Egyptian blue is a calcium copper silicate with formula CaCuSi4O10 or CaOCuO(SiO2)4. Its method of manufacturing, in a rare example of lost technology, was forgotten towards the end of antiquity, but has been plausibly reconstructed. It likely involved heating together quartz sand (silica) and some source of copper (either copper ores or scraps from the bronze industry), together with an alkali (like natron) and a calcium oxide (unintentionally added as impurities in the other materials).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another cradle of civilization, a very similar story unfolded from about 800 BC. So similar, in fact, that it has been speculated that knowledge of Egyptian blue spread along the early silk road, all the way to China, where Han blue (together with Han purple) makes an appearance during the Zhou dynasty. Han blue has almost the same chemical formula as Egyptian blue, but replaces calcium with barium: BaCuSi4O10. It may also have been an independent invention, perhaps the work of Taoist alchemists and glassmakers. Its use declined after the Han dynasty, and few examples survive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much later, China would become famous for another application of blue: the “blue and white” porcelain style. The blue here comes from cobalt oxide, which had colored Egyptian faience since at least 1500 BC, though nobody at the time knew what cobalt was. You could make cobalt blue in the form of glass and then grind it into a pigment called smalt. Despite porcelain originating in China, it seems that the use of smalt for the blue and white style began in Iraq. It spread from the Middle East to China, and then from China to the rest of the world including Europe, would eventually allow Swedish chemist Georg Brandt to identify cobalt as an element in 1735, the first time a new metal was discovered since antiquity.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the New World, the local indigo dye was being combined with a clay called palygorskite to create what became known as Maya blue, which was the main blue pigment in Mesoamerican art from about 800, and was still used as late as the 19th century, though it, too, was forgotten about for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But none of the pigments mentioned so far, not azurite, not cobalt blue, not Egyptian blue, could rival with the purest and deepest of blues, the one that came from grinding the rare lapis lazuli stone into a powder. Lapis lazuli had been extracted from mines in what is now Afghanistan since ancient times, but began being used for paint around the 5th to 7th centuries, for use in Zoroastrian and Buddhist religious art. This pigment became known to medieval and Renaissance Europeans as ultramarine, meaning “beyond the sea,” since it had to be imported at great cost from central Asia (which, to the Venetian merchants who mostly controlled this trade, was beyond the Mediterranean sea, I suppose). Nobody has written about this more eloquently than Scott Alexander:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is the process for getting ultramarine. First, go to Afghanistan. Keep in mind, you start in England or France or wherever. Afghanistan is four thousand miles away. Your path takes you through tall mountains, burning deserts, and several dozen Muslim countries that are still pissed about the whole Crusades thing. Still alive? Climb 7,000 feet through the mountains of Kuran Wa Munjan until you reach the mines of Sar-i-Sang. There, in a freezing desert, the wretched of the earth work themselves to an early grave breaking apart the rocks of Badakhshan to mine a few hundred kilograms per year of blue stone - the only lapis lazuli production in the known world.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Buy the stone and retrace your path through the burning deserts and vengeful Muslims until you’re back in England or France or wherever. Still alive? That was the easy part. Now you need to go through a chemical extraction process that makes the Philosopher's Stone look like freshman chem lab. “The lengthy process of pulverization, sifting, and washing to produce ultramarine makes the natural pigment … roughly ten times more expensive than the stone it came from.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally you have ultramarine! How much? I can’t find good numbers, but Claude estimates that the ultramarine production of all of medieval Europe was around the order of 30 kg per year - not enough to paint a medium-sized wall. Ultramarine had to be saved for ultra-high-value applications.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In practice, the medievals converged on a single use case - painting the Virgin Mary’s coat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the beginning of the 18th century, Egyptian blue had been long forgotten, and painters in Europe relied on indigo, smalt, azurite, and when they could get their hands on it, ultramarine. But this was the modern, enlightened era of European science. Great things were to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It began with a chance discovery. In Berlin around 1706, a paintmaker, Johann Jacob Diesbach, was trying to prepare red dye from cochineal.4 The details of the story are not totally ascertained, but it seems that his intended mix of cochineal insects, ferric sulfate, and potash had been tainted by another substance, perhaps bone oil from the alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel. The result was a deep blue pigment, soon to be known as Prussian blue, since Berlin was the capital of Prussia. It immediately found its niche in the art market: a deep blue, like ultramarine, but which unlike ultramarine didn’t cost more than literal gold. Within a couple of years, painters were already depicting the Virgin Mary’s robes with Prussian blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus Prussian blue became the first modern synthetic pigment. It spread far and wide, even to isolationist Japan. Large quantities of Prussian blue began entering the country around 1829, through the single trading post the Japanese allowed with Westerners, at Dejima, and very soon after, revolutionized the woodblock printing art of ukiyo-e. As early as 1831, one of the most famous works in art history was created with abundant Prussian blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prussian blue is also the blue of blueprints, created with the cyanotype process, one of the first ways to make many copies of a document. The blueprint was invented in 1842 by John Herschel and became the standard for engineering drawings; it was also used abundantly to duplicate photographs. Though it has become obsolete (replaced by whiteprint and then xerography, the currently dominant photocopying technique), it survives as the word to describe any technical, detailed plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prussian blue was only the first of a series of synthetic blue pigments that span the history of industrial civilization. In 1789, cerulean appears, the creation of Albrecht Höpfner in Switzerland. It is another compound of cobalt, but combined with tin: a cobalt stannate (Co2SnO4). It would become available to artists in paint form only in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the same period, in 1799 or 1802 (sources differ), the French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard reinvented cobalt blue. It was a commission from another chemist, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, who happened to be a minister in the government of the First French Republic. Thénard investigated the pigments at the Sèvres porcelain factory, but used a different method than the originators of smalt pigments in Egypt, Iraq, or China, using aluminium (formula: CoAl2O4). By the middle of the 19th century, the leader in the production of cobalt aluminate was Blaafarveværket, a large industrial enterprise in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this golden age of blue pigment synthesis, would it be possible to create even synthetic ultramarine? Goethe, already, had noticed the blue deposits on lime kilns when visiting Sicily in 1787. The locals used it for decoration as if it were lapis lazuli. The same phenomenon was observed in limeworks in France in the 1810s, and in 1824, the Société d’encouragement pour l’industrie nationale — a government organization dedicated to further French industry in response to the industrial revolution in Britain, and led by the aforementioned Jean-Antoine Chaptal — announced a prize of 6,000 francs to anyone who could make ultramarine for much cheaper than the price of lapis lazuli. In 1826, Jean-Baptiste Guimet succeeded in Lyon. He won the prize and established a thriving business, though he kept his methods secret and, as a result, forever has to share credit with Christian Gmelin in Tübingen, who did publish the process. It involves heating up clay, sodium hydroxide, and coal together.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artists and decorators now had their main blue pigments. Soon, industry and science would extend the use of blue to other domains. In 1897, it became practical to prepare artificial indigo in industrial quantities, eventually replacing all use of the plant. Today 80,000 tonnes are produced per year, mostly for the purpose of dying textiles, primarily denim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the turn of the 20th century, artificial food colorings became widespread, derived primarily from coal tar. One of them would become known as brilliant blue FCF or Blue No. 1. Together with Blue No. 2, which is made from indigo, it is one of the two main blue colorings, and has a strong association with the familiar-yet-mysterious blue raspberry flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1920s saw the introduction of another synthetic pigment, phthalo blue (also known as copper phthalocyanine), perhaps in a way harking back to the copper-derived compounds of ancient Egypt. It has grown to be most widely produced blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the discovery of new pigments is a rare occurrence, it still happens. In 2009, a serendipitous discovery at the Oregon State University led to YInMn Blue, so named because it contains yttrium, indium, and manganese, and pronounced “yinmin.” It is a near-perfect blue that furthermore avoids the toxicity and environmental problems of the pre-existing pigments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have this half-baked theory that science fiction is associated with blue because of blue LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this chart, which I wrote about in an old post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of competing hypotheses for why science fiction movie directors and video game designers overwhelmingly choose blue as the color of fictional user interfaces. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Accidental reasons from filmmaking considerations (from Mark Coleran):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Using simple interfaces with primary RGB colors on black looks better in film than ordinary liquid-crystal screens, so most UIs in video media is either red, green, or blue&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Red is associated with weapons, and green with vintage electronics (which commonly used green-phosphor monochrome monitors), leaving blue as the generic and/or futuristic choice&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blue is easier to color-correct: a lot of filmed material tends to look blue before color correction, but you don’t need this when the image is supposed to be blue&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cultural associations:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blue fits well with science fiction thanks to associations like coldness, knowledge, otherworldliness, and creative transcendence (found in some academic paper in Korean thanks to Elicit)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Something something near-far Robin Hanson something something6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blue is rare in nature except the for sea and sky, so “there’s something fundamentally mystical, unnatural, and inhuman about it” (from Noessel, cited in ‘Future Screens are Mostly Blue’)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most science fiction creators simply copy the tropes of existing science fiction, so they choose blue because it already is the “science fiction color.” (And picking something else is likely to be interpreted as an intentional deviation for a specific purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d guess that the actual, immediate reason for most blue in science fiction is the last one. Unless creators make a conscious artistic choice to deviate, they tend to copy what’s typical and expected in their chosen genre. Yet those norms and expectations have to come from somewhere. It’s possible that the items in the first part of the list, about decisions having to do with the techniques of filmmaking rather than with the artistic meaning of blue, are the actual cause for some early shows that snowballed into the ubiquity of blue interfaces today, but that seems a bit like post-hoc justification to me unless we can find evidence of those decisions being made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it’s probably cultural associations, but most of them also just kick the can further. Overall I suppose I somewhat agree with Noessel: it may well come down to the difficulty in finding blue in nature. Or finding it in technology, considering the history of blue pigments that we just went over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And not just pigments. There is another realm in which blue has proven incredibly difficult to produce: light. In fact we found the solution so recently that it is why, I speculate, the future is still strongly associated with blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of how we produce light is a fun one, spanning all of our technological history and involving dozens of solutions, from prehistoric oil lamps to candles to coal gas to cold-cathode tubes. But most of those solutions have produced light somewhere between white and the reddish yellow of flames or black-body radiation. If you wanted blue light, you could make a bulb out of blue glass (with cobalt!) and put an incandescent filament in it. This worked okay, but blue light bulbs did tend to be less satisfying than the other colors, or at least that’s what I remember from Christmas lights when I was a kid.7 There were other strategies for blue lights: construct a tube like the familiar red-glowing neon ones, and put mercury vapor in it. Low-brightness phosphors for RGB screens. Greenish-blue vacuum fluorescent displays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, blue light was not an unsolved problem. But it wasn’t as conclusively solved as light in the other spectral colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, light-emitting diodes started becoming practical. LEDs are the most efficient way of creating light by far, but the properties of the materials they are made of — semiconductors that emit light when traversed with an electrical current — make it much easier to generate radiation in the less energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus the first practical LED emitted infrared light, by Texas Instruments in 1962. Later that same year, the first visible-light LED was made at General Electric, in red. Displays made of red LEDs soon became widespread in electronic devices (replacing Nixie tubes, also reddish) after some further advances by Hewlett-Packard circa 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humanity then gradually conquered the rest of the visible light spectrum, with orange, yellow, and green LEDs being developed in the 1970s. But blue remained elusive. A practical, bright blue LED would not be made, despite much research being poured into it by electronics companies around the world, until a breakthrough by Shuji Nakamura in Japan in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This completed the color spectrum and enabled us to create white LEDs, which are now quickly replacing nearly every lighting technology since they cost so little and are so customizable. We can say we have essentially “solved” lighting. Blue LEDs also enabled the first blue lasers in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very recent development! For a very long time, blue would have been the color that only “future tech” could create. Then, for a brief period, it would have been the color of cutting-edge tech. Now, 30 years later, the tech exists and is widespread, but we still have the memory of that time. And furthermore no other color can take its place as the inaccessible one; we’ve conquered the entire spectrum.8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the futuristic quality of blue really come from LEDs? Maybe, maybe not. I’m not sure there’s a direct causal link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But given the full history of blue pigments, I wouldn’t be surprised to find some truth in this speculative scenario: that there were just enough innovations in blue, a steady trickle of serendipitous discoveries and long-term research efforts to produce better versions of it, to keep it in the mind of humans as the color of the artificial and the cutting-edge. If you wore indigo-dyed clothes in ancient India, you were one step more removed from nature than the person who wore plain cotton. If you used blue pottery in Egypt or Iraq or China, you were clearly cooler than the people who used plain terracotta. If you hired an engineer or architect at the peak of the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, they’d be way more efficient at their job if they duplicated their drawings with Prussian blue instead of copying them by hand. And if you want to make your city a herald of the high-tech future, you decorate everything with programmable blue LEDs. No other color would do.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One could say the same about purple, which has its own history of being a super expensive pigment, Tyrian purple, and holds the distinction of being one of the first synthetic dyes, mauveine. But purple is less common and important than blue. Besides, it doesn’t really exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we’re here, let’s note that Tyrian purple, made from sea snails, may be related to a blue dye of great significance in Jewish culture, tekhelet. It has been speculated that tekhelet comes from Hexaplex trunculus snails. I didn’t mention it in the main text because its origin is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From which we derive the word aniline, a common industrial chemical that is nowadays used to make indigo and various other dyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: cobalt is named after kobolds, mischievous spirits from German folklore, because miners in Germany would attribute to them the unusual properties of the ore containing the metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, the history of cochineal dye, made from insects grown on cactus according to secret ancestral techniques of the Zapotec people, and the second-highest valued export from New Spain after silver, is fascinating in its own right. By the way it’s still used as food coloring, so if you eat artificially red foods, you probably eat insects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthetic ultramarine is also (in)famous for being the main component (together with a resin) of International Klein Blue, the creation of artist Yves Klein, who painted large monochrome paintings with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically posts like ‘Is Blue Far?’ and ‘Near Far in Science Fiction’. Blue might be associated with “far” in terms of construal level theory and likewise for science fiction, which makes an association natural. I thought this was a mind blowing point when I first encountered it some years ago but now it seems rather unconvincing, which is why I’m relegating it to a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s because the filaments glow yellow, and a lot of the light is filtered by the blue glass, leaving dim light bulbs. But also the blue glass tended to become discolored, and then you’d just get a plain white bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There can’t be a purple LED since purple isn’t a spectral color, with the exception of violet. And violet LEDs appeared about the same time as the blue ones. There is active development of ultraviolet LED, especially for disinfecting lamps, but of course we won’t be able to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suppose one intriguing possibility would be if we were to invent new colors altogether, by modifying the biology of color perception. Then maybe the color of the future would become octarine or something.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head&gt; Release notes &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better transaction balancing, include improvements, auto posting account interpolation, csv data commands, import archiving, timeclock improvements, fixes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;hledger 1.50&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breaking changes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction balancing is now done in a more robust way, using local precisions only (like Ledger) #2402.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Until now, a transaction was required to balance using its commodities's global display precisions.&lt;lb/&gt;Small imbalances were tolerated by configuring display precisions for the whole journal (with&lt;code&gt;commodity&lt;/code&gt;directives).&lt;p&gt;Now, a transaction is required to balance using the precisions in its journal entry only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This means each entry can use the precision it needs, and balancing precision and display precision are independent.&lt;lb/&gt;(So eg, increasing the display precision with&lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;no longer breaks the journal.)&lt;p&gt;In practice this requires journal entries to be more accurate, and you will probably need to fix some old entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;There are three main ways to fix an entry:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;reduce the amounts' precision (use fewer decimal digits, so a lower balancing precision is inferred)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;make the amounts more accurate (use better decimal digits, so the amounts sum to zero more closely)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;or (easiest) add an amountless "expenses:rounding" posting (this is not a cheat, it's a more accurate record of what your bank/broker is doing).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also keep the old transaction-balancing behaviour with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--txn-balancing=old&lt;/code&gt;, for now.&lt;lb/&gt;But updating your entries is recommended.&lt;p&gt;The old behaviour could allow small remainders to accumulate over time,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;in accounts that often have an inexact posting amount or cost amount and are never reconciled -&lt;lb/&gt;typically equity, revenues, and expenses.&lt;lb/&gt;You can check for this in your old journals with a command like&lt;code&gt;hledger bal cur:\\$ -c '$1.000000000000' | grep -E '\...0*[1-9]'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;(show $ account balances, with many decimals, which have a non-zero decimal in the 3rd place or beyond)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Timeclock format has had various changes:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Timeclock syntax and parsing is now more robust (when not using --old-timeclock): &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Semicolon always starts a comment (and timeclock account names may not include semicolons).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Trailing spaces are ignored.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Clock-ins now require an account name.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Clock-outs now can have a comment and tags.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Timeclock entries are processed in parse order.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Some order-related bugs in 1.43 have been fixed.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Concurrent/overlapping sessions are now fully supported, even if they have the same account name.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The timeclock doc has been rewritten.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The --old-timeclock hidden flag has been renamed, documented, and now also affects included files.&lt;lb/&gt;#2141, #2365, #2400, #2417&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Timeclock syntax and parsing is now more robust (when not using --old-timeclock): &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some edge cases in balance report behaviour were changed for internal consistency:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;hledger now requires at least GHC 9.6 (and base 4.18), to ease maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paging long output no longer gives an error when&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LESS&lt;/code&gt;is undefined and&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;does not have mouse support (as on some FreeBSD systems).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;all:&lt;/code&gt;query now requires at least one posting to match.&lt;lb/&gt;(Previously, matching no postings at all was also considered a success.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using journal format's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;directive, several kinds of&lt;lb/&gt;error (read failure, cyclic include..) could show an off-by-one line&lt;lb/&gt;number or excerpt, confusingly. This has been fixed.&lt;lb/&gt;Also, attempting to include a rules file now gives a better error message.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CSV&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;rules, match group references like&lt;code&gt;\1&lt;/code&gt;no longer get confused&lt;lb/&gt;by differing case.&lt;lb/&gt;(Jay Neubrand, #2419)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;commodities&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt;now support the --conf and -n/--no-conf flags,&lt;lb/&gt;like other commands.&lt;lb/&gt;#2446&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Windows machines, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;command now properly shows green prompts instead of ANSI codes.&lt;lb/&gt;#2410&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance reports now properly show the historical balance even when the report period is empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;#2403&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance reports' csv output, and the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;balance --budget&lt;/code&gt;report, now respect the --summary-only flag.&lt;lb/&gt;(Stephen Morgan, #2411, #2443)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;demo&lt;/code&gt;command no longer mentions&lt;code&gt;-- ASCIINEMAOPTS&lt;/code&gt;in help (that longer works).&lt;lb/&gt;Also it shows a better error message when asciinema is not installed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;hledger help -m TOPIC&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;hledger help -i TOPIC&lt;/code&gt;now show the help for TOPIC, as intended.&lt;lb/&gt;#2399&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since hledger 1.32.1, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;command, when importing multiple files at once,&lt;lb/&gt;would write an empty .latest file for data files with no new transactions&lt;lb/&gt;(causing all transactions in those data files to appear new on next import).&lt;lb/&gt;This is now fixed.&lt;lb/&gt;#2444&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CSV rules files can now run a shell command to clean the data:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;# read the latest foo*.csv file, and replace "USD" with "$" source foo*.csv | sed -e 's/USD/$/g'&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;or to generate the data:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;# fetch JSON from simplefin.org, then transform it to CSV source | simplefinjson | simplefincsv&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whenever hledger runs one of these commands, it will echo the command on stderr.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;command can now automatically archive imported CSV data files,&lt;lb/&gt;saving a dated copy in a&lt;code&gt;data/&lt;/code&gt;directory. This can be useful for troubleshooting,&lt;lb/&gt;or for regenerating entries later with improved rules.&lt;lb/&gt;To enable it, add&lt;code&gt;archive&lt;/code&gt;to the rules file.&lt;p&gt;This and the previous feature can simplify file management and reduce the need for support scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improvements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In command line help, flag group headings have been simplified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;And the help for -f/--file,&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;is now clearer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;When given both an unknown command and an unknown flag, hledger now gives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;a clearer error message (about the command, not the flag).&lt;lb/&gt;#2388&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long standing awkwardness with addon commands has been solved:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;you can now use addon options freely in a hledger command line;&lt;lb/&gt;you don't need to write a&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;argument first.&lt;lb/&gt;#458&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In smart dates and period expressions, quarter syntax like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2025q1&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;Q2&lt;/code&gt;is now fully supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In end-value reports where the end date is unspecified, market prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;in the future can no longer influence the report end date and valuation date.&lt;lb/&gt;(Market prices on or before today, still can.)&lt;lb/&gt;#2445&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tag:&lt;/code&gt;query with the&lt;code&gt;accounts&lt;/code&gt;command now only matches account tags, not posting tags.&lt;lb/&gt;Eg,&lt;code&gt;hledger accounts tag:t&lt;/code&gt;now lists only account a from this journal:&lt;code&gt;account a ; t: 2025-01-01 a 1 b -1 ; t:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journal format's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;directive now has more robust and convenient glob patterns:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;can match both directories and filenames&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;now automatically ignores anything under dotted directories, like .git/, foo/.secret/, etc.&lt;lb/&gt;(If you do want it to search dotted directories,&lt;lb/&gt;you can use the --old-glob flag for now to restore the old behaviour. See also Glob#49.)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Glob patterns with wildcards now automatically exclude the current file.&lt;lb/&gt;Eg&lt;code&gt;include **.journal&lt;/code&gt;will include all other .journal files in this directory and below.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;'s error messages and debug messages have been improved.&lt;lb/&gt;Eg, the including file paths are also shown.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journal format's auto posting rules can now use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%account&lt;/code&gt;to insert the account name&lt;lb/&gt;from the matched posting.&lt;lb/&gt;(Stephen Morgan, #1975, #2412)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;aregister&lt;/code&gt;command no longer abbreviates account names&lt;lb/&gt;when producing&lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt;fods&lt;/code&gt;output.&lt;lb/&gt;(savanto, #1995, #2416)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;commodities&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;payees&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;tags&lt;/code&gt;commands now have --used/--declared/--undeclared/--unused flags, like&lt;code&gt;accounts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt;And there has been a general cleanup of options and help across these four commands.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;command now shows info messages on stderr, not stdout.&lt;lb/&gt;Its "no new transactions" output is more compact, showing file names not file paths.&lt;lb/&gt;And it no longer prints an extra newline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt;command's output has been improved.&lt;lb/&gt;Lack of a pager is now reported as info, not warning (there's no default pager on Windows).&lt;lb/&gt;Shell completions are ignored for now.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docs&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;import: use windows-compatible quotes in watchexec example&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;note fish LEDGER_FILE setup&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For all install options, see hledger.org: Install.&lt;lb/&gt; You can install hledger from most package managers (but check for a green badge indicating it's up to date).&lt;lb/&gt; Or you can build it from source yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or you can install up to date binaries from this page, by following the appropriate instructions below.&lt;lb/&gt; If you find problems with these instructions, please let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt; All platforms &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have eget, that's a convenient way to download the right binaries for your machine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;eget simonmichael/hledger --all
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt; GNU/Linux, 64-bit Intel &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -fLOC- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.50/hledger-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar -xzv -f- -C/usr/local/bin hledger hledger-ui hledger-web
hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt; Mac, 64-bit ARM or Intel &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a terminal window (don't download the binaries with your web browser, they won't get authorised):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On ARM macs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -fLOC- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.50/hledger-mac-arm64.tar.gz | tar -xzv -f- -C/usr/local/bin hledger hledger-ui hledger-web
hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Intel macs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl -fLOC- https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.50/hledger-mac-x64.tar.gz | tar -xzv -f- -C/usr/local/bin hledger hledger-ui hledger-web
hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt; Windows, 64-bit ARM or Intel &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a powershell window (press &lt;code&gt;WINDOWS-R&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;powershell&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ENTER&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd ~
curl https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/releases/download/1.43.2/hledger-windows-x64.zip -OutFile hledger-windows-x64.zip
Expand-Archive hledger-windows-x64.zip -Force -DestinationPath AppData\Roaming\local\bin
hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    # should show 1.50
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt; Windows 7, 64-bit Intel &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These instructions have not been tested recently, please let us know if they work for you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;click hledger-windows-x64.zip below&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;choose Open with Windows Explorer, OK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;click Extract all files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;choose a destination folder - ideally one that appears in &lt;code&gt;echo %PATH%&lt;/code&gt;, like&lt;code&gt;C:\Windows&lt;/code&gt;(though that one will require administrator permission); otherwise, your home directory (&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\YOURNAME&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;check "Show extracted files when complete"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;click Extract, wait for the destination folder to open&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;find the hledger, hledger-web icons (if you extracted to &lt;code&gt;\Windows&lt;/code&gt;, you'll need to scroll down)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;for each icon: double-click, uncheck "Always ask before opening this file", click Run&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;close those Explorer windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;open a command window (press Windows-r, type CMD, press enter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version&lt;/code&gt;should show 1.50&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo # &amp;gt;&amp;gt; .hledger.journal&lt;/code&gt;to ensure a default journal file exists. (Important: the doubled &amp;gt;&amp;gt; is needed to avoid overwriting existing data.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starting hledger by double-clicking its icon won't work because it needs arguments; run it from the command window instead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starting hledger-web by double-clicking its icon may fail eg because Explorer's command window is too small;&lt;lb/&gt;configure that to be larger, or run hledger-web from a command window instead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hledger or hledger-web may fail to run if there is not enough memory available.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Next steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once installed, run &lt;code&gt;hledger&lt;/code&gt;, and perhaps read hledger.org: Quick start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

That's what your M4 CPU is for</title><updated>2025-09-04T11:32:15.616839+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="86469075437e4505"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, Apple just dropped its new "Liquid Glass" design language, and yeah, it looks slick. Translucent, fluid, subtly animated. The kind of thing that makes you nod and say, "Yep, that’s Apple." But while everyone’s drooling over the aesthetics, I’m sitting here having a serious Vista flashback. How many CPU cycles is this beauty actually costing us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s be real: eye candy always comes at a price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember macOS’s dynamic video wallpapers? Gorgeous when you login to a couple windows open on your screen. But open a few Chrome tabs, a Figma project, and a Docker container? Suddenly that serene mountain vista starts stuttering like a flipbook. I’ve had it freeze outright mid-scroll, crashing back to a black image more times than I can count. It’s a microcosm of the problem: When the system’s stressed, the pretty things break first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember Windows Vista’s Aero. That glassy transparency and window animations? A notorious resource hog that brought mid-2000s hardware to its knees. Fancy compositing effects, reflections, blurs, fluid morphs. They chew through GPU/CPU time. Always have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have this little web app I built for my kids to help them manage their day. It has those tiles that animate when you hover on them. Looks buttery smooth on my Ryzen 9 and NVIDIA laptop where I develop it. But the app runs on Raspberry Pi 4. The moment a single tile wiggles? The entire UI crawls. Why? Because the tiles blur the background. Now a blur is nothing compared to physics-based animation like Liquid Glass suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my hot take: Apple knows exactly what they’re doing. They’re shipping Liquid Glass now because the M4 (and M3, M2...) is absurdly overpowered for what 90% of users actually do. Checking mail? Browsing? Streaming? Your M4 is bored out of its silicon mind. Liquid Glass is Apple’s way of saying, "Fine, you’re not pushing the CPU? We’ll burn those idle cycles to make your dock shimmer."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's stealth bloat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might not feel the drag today. That’s the point! The M4’s raw power is the perfect smokescreen. But those cycles aren’t free:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Battery life? Subtle drain adds up.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thermals? More work = more heat = more fan spin (even if quieter now).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Future-proofing? What runs smooth on an M4 today might chug on baseline M5 in 3 years when macOS demands more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Real workloads? Try rendering a 4K video while those fluid animations dance. Suddenly, those "idle cycles" aren’t so idle.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Liquid Glass isn’t a "deal breaker." It’s Apple flexing their hardware muscle. But let’s not pretend it’s computationally weightless. This is Vista Aero wearing a $2000 cashmere sweater. Smoother, quieter, but still making your hardware work harder just to look cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it worth it? For Apple’s vibe? Probably. But next time your fan whispers or your battery dips faster than expected… maybe blame the glass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Liquid Glass is gorgeous tech debt. Your M4 can afford it… for now. But never forget: fancy pixels demand fancy math.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
