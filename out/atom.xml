    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GitHub → Codeberg: my experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published . Estimated reading time: 11 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In which I talk about the process involved in switching forges, and how well that went.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: this very site that you’re reading this on is not served from GitHub Pages anymore! At this point, I’d call my migration successful. But it took more than clicking a single button, so let’s talk about the steps involved, at least for me. I’m hoping that it can help be an example for other people, and show that it’s actually not that complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;(My) migration process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I took an hour or so to set up my profile picture, email address(es), SSH keys…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 1: migrating the repos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t difficult, because Forgejo (the forge software that powers Codeberg) offers a “migrate from GitHub” functionality. You need to generate a PAT on GitHub to import things like issues (which is awesome!), and as a bonus it also speeds up the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was, however, tedious, because the process was entirely manual (perhaps there’s a way to automate it, like by using some Forgejo CLI tool, but I didn’t bother looking into that). And, due to GitHub API rate limits, whenever I tried importing two repos at the same time, one or both would fail. (It wasn’t too bad, though, since I could fill out the migration page for the next while one was in progress; and generally, it took me roughly as long to fill it out as it took Codeberg to perform the import.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m really happy that issues, PRs, wikis, and releases can be imported flawlessly: this makes it possible to not have to refer to GitHub anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 2: repointing links to Codeberg&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course I don’t control all links that point to my stuff, but I could at least run &lt;code&gt;rg -F github.com/ISSOtm&lt;/code&gt; in my home directory, to catch those within my own repos. It’s possible to automate the replacing process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and if you’re feeling like bulk-replacing all files in a directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repositories, however, may still be pointing to GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 
 )
 )
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can either manually &lt;code&gt;git remote set-url origin git@codeberg.org:ISSOtm/rsgbds.git&lt;/code&gt; (or the equivalent if you’re using HTTPS), or use one of the replace commands above, since remote URLs are stored textually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Within a single repo:

# For all repos within the current directory: (requires `shopt -s globstar` if using Bash)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…then it’s a matter of pushing the changes to all of the repos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 3: stubbing out the GitHub repos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also wanted to make it clear that my repos were now living on Codeberg; so, I created a little script in an empty directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, to run it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 
 
 
 
 
# ...etc.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The automation made it not painful, so this went pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 4: porting CI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, onto the harder stuff :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first interesting thing that I noticed is this section of Codeberg’s CI documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Running CI/CD pipelines can use significant amounts of energy. As much as it is tempting to have green checkmarks everywhere, running the jobs costs real money and has environmental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unlike other giant platforms, we do not encourage you to write “heavy” pipelines and charge you for the cost later. We expect you to carefully consider the costs and benefits from your pipelines and reduce CI/CD usage to a minimum amount necessary to guarantee consistent quality for your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That got me to think about which projects of mine really need CI, and ultimately, I decided that I would only need CI for publishing my website, and the documentation of gb-starter-kit and fortISSimO; the rest of my projects don’t get contributions anyway, so I can live without CI on them, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, Codeberg actually has two different CI solutions: Woodpecker, and Forgejo Actions; the former seems to be more powerful, but you need to apply for access, and the latter is very close to GitHub Actions, which should facilitate the migration. So I picked Forgejo Actions, even though it’s marked as being in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not very difficult to port a YAML file from GHA to Forgejo Actions; for example, look at the commit porting gb-starter-kit’s publishing CI. (This doesn’t really appear as a diff, since I’ve moved the file; but it’s small, so it’s easy to compare manually.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some salient points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Actions are normally just referred to as &lt;code&gt;owner/repo&lt;/code&gt;, but Forgejo supports cloning any Git repo, especially across forges. It’s actually recommended to use full URLs always, so you don’t rely on the default prefix, which is configurable by the instance admin and thus not necessarily portable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I could have kept the files in &lt;code&gt;.github/workflows&lt;/code&gt;, since Forgejo picks up that directory automatically if&lt;code&gt;.forgejo/workflows&lt;/code&gt;doesn’t exist; however, I think it’s more convenient to keep un-migrated scripts in&lt;code&gt;.github&lt;/code&gt;and migrated ones in&lt;code&gt;.forgejo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most Actions (the individual steps, not the workflow files) actually work out of the box on Forgejo Actions. Nice!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Codeberg’s runners differ from GitHub’s significantly: they have way less software installed by default, fewer resources, and only Linux runners are provided (Ubuntu by default, but you can use any Docker container image). macOS and Windows being non-free OSes, Codeberg has no plans to offer either of those! For both philosophical and financial reasons. If this is a deal-breaker for you, consider cross-compiling, or bringing your own runner.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unless low latency is crucial, consider using the lazy runners for better load balancing and possibly greener energy consumption. In practice I haven’t seen delays beyond a few minutes, which is acceptable to me.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually spent some extra time trying to use less compute to perform my CI jobs, somewhat motivated by the small size of the runners, and because I’m guessing that the smaller the runner you’re picking, the faster your job will be able to be scheduled. Here is one such commit; note in particular line 50, where I tried1 using a Docker image with LaTeX preinstalled, which saves the time taken by &lt;code&gt;apt install&lt;/code&gt; and requires fewer writes to the filesystem, freeing up RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to a version discrepancy with &lt;code&gt;noweb&lt;/code&gt;, I had to revert to the base Ubuntu image; but a “regular” LaTeX workflow would have had no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 5: re-hosting my website&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the previous steps were done within the span of a few days; however, since my website (this very website) was hosted using GitHub Pages, I couldn’t migrate its repos (yes, plural: you can configure individual repos to be published separately, which is how e.g. https://eldred.fr/fortISSimO is published, despite not being in the website’s main repo).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nominally, Codeberg has an equivalent, Codeberg Pages; however, as mentioned on that page, &lt;quote&gt;the software behind this feature is currently in maintenance mode&lt;/quote&gt;, because of complexity and performance issues2. So I left it at that for roughly a month, hoping there’ll eventually be an update. Also, subprojects are published as subdomains instead of subdirectories, which would have broken links (e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://eldred.fr/fortISSimO&lt;/code&gt; would have become &lt;code&gt;http://fortISSimO.eldred.fr&lt;/code&gt;). Meh…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then (by chance lol) I discovered git-pages and its public instance Grebedoc3! It functions much like GitHub Pages, though with a bit more setup since it’s not integrated within the forge itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;git-pages actually has several niceties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My website had zero downtime during the entire migration, as git-pages supports uploading your website before updating your DNS records!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It also supports server-side redirects, which lets me redirect people who still go to http://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/* to its new home, for example. People have been getting 404s because of incomplete client-side coverage on my side, but no more!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It also also supports custom headers; I’m not particularly interested in CORS, but I’ve used that file to pay my respects4.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and also, Codeberg’s November 2025 newsletter mentions that &lt;quote&gt;Codeberg is planning to gradually migrate to [git-pages]&lt;/quote&gt;. Exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m actually much happier using this than GitHub Pages; so, I’ve joined Catherine’s Patreon, because I want to see this go far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quote Catherine’s motivation for creating git-pages: &lt;quote&gt;I started out wanting to just use Codeberg Pages and then I found out that Codeberg Pages is in maintenance mode and has such poor architecture that not only does it have rather low uptime but it also regularly crashes Codeberg’s Forgejo instance itself.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🦃. It is intensely looking at you…….&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some context as to what this means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Time tracking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps 1 through 3 (migrating the repos) took me the better part of an afternoon; step 4 (porting CI) took me another afternoon, mostly to learn the new CI system; and step 5 (the website) took me… well, it should have taken an afternoon, but I used the opportunity to also pay down some tech debt (merging my slides repo into my main website), which took a few days due to required rearchitecting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, even with 45 repos migrated, this basically took a weekend. And I didn’t find it annoying!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the task seemed really daunting, my anxiety caused me to procrastinate this a lot, but in the end it was little work. One of the reasons I’m writing this is to let other people know that, so they can overcome their own anxiety. Maybe. :P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, I’m very happy with this migration! As far as I can tell, nothing on this website has broken, and I’ve tried reasonably containing the breakage over on GitHub: I have truncated the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branches, but all other branches and tags remain in place (mostly due to laziness lol), permalinks (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-bootroms/blob/c8ed9e106e0ab1193a57071820e46358006c79d0/src/dmg.asm&lt;/code&gt;) still work, only non-perma links (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-bootroms/blob/master/src/dmg.asm&lt;/code&gt;) are broken, but those are unreliable in the first place anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since that means that all of my code is still on GitHub, I want to delete my repos; but that would be a bad idea at this point, due to leaving no redirects or anything. I’ll consider that again in… idk, a year or something. I would also like to delete my GitHub account (like I have deleted my Twitter account when… *gestures vaguely*), but not only do I need my repos to be up, I also need my account to contribute to projects that are still on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One downside of this migration is that since I’m moving off of The Main Forge, my projects are likely to get fewer contributions… But I wasn’t getting many in the first place, and some people have already made accounts on Codeberg to keep contributing to my stuff. Likewise, I’m not really worried about discoverability. We’ll see I guess lol 🤷♂️&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’m writing this after the migration, and I haven’t really taken notes during it; so, if I’ve forgotten any steps, feel free to let me know in the comments below or by opening an issue, and I’ll edit this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Special thanks&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sentinel-1D delivers first images: from Antarctica to Bremen&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first high-resolution images have been received from Copernicus Sentinel-1D and were shared publicly for the first time at the European Space Agency’s Ministerial Council, held today in Bremen, Germany. Glaciers in Antarctica, the tip of South America, as well as the city of Bremen, are visible in these stunning radar images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission saw the arrival in orbit of its latest satellite earlier in November: Sentinel-1D was launched on 4 November, on board an Ariane 6 launcher from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once in orbit, the satellite and its instruments – it carries a 12 m-long synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument – were switched on, ready to capture images during a pass over the Antarctic and South America two days after launch. On the night of 6 November (European time), the first images were captured over the Antarctic Peninsula, the Tierra del Fuego and the Thwaites Glacier. Some six hours later, on the morning of 7 November, Sentinel-1D also captured images over Bremen, in Germany. The data was then transmitted, or ‘downlinked’, from the satellite to the ground station, in Matera (Italy), which is part of the Copernicus Ground Segment. All this was done within 50 hours of launch, which is likely to be the shortest time from launch to data delivery for a radar-based Earth observation satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Nuno Miranda, ESA’s Sentinel-1 Mission Manager, the images are of unprecedented data quality for a ‘first light’ acquisition. They are very similar to the images captured not so long ago by Sentinel-1C, which, according to Nuno, is very promising for the commissioning phase. He noted, “These images have been downlinked and processed within an exceptionally short timeframe. Some of us remember that when Sentinel-1B was launched, it delivered its first radar images within two hours of activation. Sentinel-1D achieved this in an even faster time, setting what we believe is a new record for space radar. This remarkable performance reflects the dedication and exceptional preparation of all the teams involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radar instruments can image Earth’s surface through clouds, precipitation, regardless of sunlight, making them particularly well suited for monitoring polar regions. The Sentinel-1C and -1D satellites also carry an Automatic Identification System (AIS) instrument – improving the mission capacity to detect ships and sea pollution. The Sentinel-1D AIS was also activated as the satellite passed over Antarctica capturing the presence of ships in these extreme areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First images show fragility of glaciers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Antarctic Peninsula (above) is part of the larger peninsula of West Antarctica, protruding 1300 km. It is an ice sheet resting on a string of rocky islands and its tip is just 1000 km from the southern tip of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet is one of the smallest ice sheets in Antarctica but is perhaps the most vulnerable to climate change as its glaciers are small and in a region of rapid warming. Observable changes such as collapsing ice shelves, thinning and accelerating glaciers are all key indicators of climate change in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This image is in black and white, showing the contrast between the ocean and the peninsula’s icy landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tierra del Fuego (above) is an archipelago off the southern tip of the South American continent. It covers territory in both Argentina to the east and in Chile to the west and is separated from the mainland by the Magellan Strait. The most southerly point of Tierra del Fuego is Cape Horn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bright contrasting colours in this image are created by using multiple types of radar wave, known polarisations. In this image the ocean and snowy peaks are shown in shades of blue, while the land appears yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thwaites Glacier, and the adjacent Pine Island Glacier (above), are located west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Both are vulnerable to climate change. Thwaites is one of the most unstable glaciers in Antarctica and is at risk of rapid retreat. The details shown in this image from Sentinel-1D remind us of the fragility of glaciers in the Antarctic. And since 2025 is the United Nation’s International Year of Glaciers' Preservation, it is timely to see this image, captured on 6 November 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This image also uses multiple radar polarisations to capture enhanced data on the landscape. In this image, the sea ice in the water is visible in tones of purple or violet, while the glacier appears white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The publication of these images also follows the 30th meeting of the Conference of Parties, or COP30, where the consequences of climate change and the mitigating actions needed were discussed. The World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Climate Update for COP30 notes that glaciers, from October 2023 to September 2024, lost the largest amount of ice on record back to 1950. The report states this is equivalent to 1.2 mm of global mean sea-level rise. The report also notes that, on 24 February 2025, the extent of Antarctic sea-ice reached its third lowest extent since satellite records began in 1978, the lowest being in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simonetta Cheli, Director of ESA’s Earth Observation Programmes, said, “This is a great achievement and I am so pleased to see these results from Sentinel-1D. It really places the data we receive from our innovative missions in the spotlight – it is data that we as a society rely upon as we continue to discuss and take action on climate change, and also data that we need in applications for understanding and studying our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Sentinel-1 team has done an amazing job and I would like to thank everyone within ESA, together with our partners in the space industry and European institutions, for delivering work of such high quality. It’s an honour to deliver this mission for the Copernicus Earth observation programme, and we thank the Commission for their support and collaboration. We look forward also to developing the Sentinel missions of the future, to further extend the capacity and potential of Copernicus for Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ESA’s Sentinel-1 Project Manager, Ramón Torres, expressed the whole team’s pride, “Unveiling the first images from Sentinel-1D is an incredibly emotional milestone for all of us. The sense of awe and fulfilment goes beyond the thrill of liftoff itself, because seeing those breathtaking images from the SAR instrument brings our hard work to life. They are not just pictures – they are proof of our vision becoming reality, underlining how cutting-edge this mission truly is. The fact that these stunning images also confirm the satellite’s health and flawless operation fills us with relief and joy. And to have achieved all of this within an astonishingly short time – just over two days after launch – makes this moment even more unforgettable for our team.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Spring 2025 (227-0003-10L)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the wiki for Digital Design and Computer Architecture for Spring 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Announcements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Course Information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Description&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The class provides a first introduction to the design of digital circuits and computer architecture. It covers technical foundations of how a computing platform is designed from the bottom up. It introduces various execution paradigms, hardware description languages, and principles in digital design and computer architecture. The focus is on fundamental techniques employed in the design of modern microprocessors and their hardware/software interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Objectives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This class provides a first approach to Computer Architecture. The students learn the design of digital circuits in order to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the basics,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the principles (of design),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the precedents (in computer architecture).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on such understanding, the students are expected to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;learn how a modern computer works underneath, from the bottom up,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;evaluate tradeoffs of different designs and ideas,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implement a principled design (a simple microprocessor),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;learn to systematically debug increasingly complex systems,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hopefully be prepared to develop novel, out-of-the-box designs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The focus is on basics, principles, precedents, and how to use them to create/implement good designs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;# Writing a good CLAUDE.md&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyle Mistele · November 25, 2025 · &amp;lt; 10 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: this post is also applicable to &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;, the open-source equivalent of &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; for agents and harnesses like OpenCode, Zed, Cursor and Codex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## Principle: LLMs are (mostly) stateless&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are stateless functions. Their weights are frozen by the time they're used for inference, so they don't learn over time. The only thing that the model knows about your codebase is the tokens you put into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, coding agent harnesses such as Claude Code usually require you to manage agents' memory explicitly. &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;) is the only file that by default goes into every single conversation you have with the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has three important implications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coding agents know absolutely nothing about your codebase at the beginning of each session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The agent must be told anything that's important to know about your codebase each time you start a session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;is the preferred way of doing this.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; onboards Claude to your codebase&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Claude doesn't know anything about your codebase at the beginning of each session, you should use &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; to onboard Claude into your codebase. At a high level, this means it should cover:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WHAT: tell Claude about the tech, your stack, the project structure. Give Claude a map of the codebase. This is especially important in monorepos! Tell Claude what the apps are, what the shared packages are, and what everything is for so that it knows where to look for things&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WHY: tell Claude the purpose of the project and what everything is doing in the repository. What are the purpose and function of the different parts of the project?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HOW: tell Claude how it should work on the project. For example, do you use &lt;code&gt;bun&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;? You want to include all the information it needs to actually do meaningful work on the project. How can Claude verify Claude's changes? How can it run tests, typechecks, and compilation steps?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the way you do this is important! Don't try to stuff every command Claude could possibly need to run in your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file - you will get sub-optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## Claude often ignores &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of which model you're using, you may notice that Claude frequently ignores your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file's contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can investigate this yourself by putting a logging proxy between the claude code CLI and the Anthropic API using &lt;code&gt;ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL&lt;/code&gt;. Claude code injects the following system reminder with your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file in the user message to the agent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;system-reminder&amp;gt; IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task. &amp;lt;/system-reminder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, Claude will ignore the contents of your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; if it decides that it is not relevant to its current task. The more information you have in the file that's not universally applicable to the tasks you have it working on, the more likely it is that Claude will ignore your instructions in the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did Anthropic add this? It's hard to say for sure, but we can speculate a bit. Most &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; files we come across include a bunch of instructions in the file that aren't broadly applicable. Many users treat the file as a way to add "hotfixes" to behavior they didn't like by appending lots of instructions that weren't necessarily broadly applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can only assume that the Claude Code team found that by telling Claude to ignore the bad instructions, the harness actually produced better results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## Creating a good &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following section provides a number of recommendations on how to write a good &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file following context engineering best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary. Not all of these rules are necessarily optimal for every setup. Like anything else, feel free to break the rules once...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you understand when &amp;amp; why it's okay to break them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you have a good reason to do so&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Less (instructions) is more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to try and stuff every single command that claude could possibly need to run, as well as your code standards and style guidelines into &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;. We recommend against this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the topic hasn't been investigated in an incredibly rigorous manner, some research has been done which indicates the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frontier thinking LLMs can follow ~ 150-200 instructions with reasonable consistency. Smaller models can attend to fewer instructions than larger models, and non-thinking models can attend to fewer instructions than thinking models.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smaller models get MUCH worse, MUCH more quickly. Specifically, smaller models tend to exhibit an expotential decay in instruction-following performance as the number of instructions increase, whereas larger frontier thinking models exhibit a linear decay (see below). For this reason, we recommend against using smaller models for multi-step tasks or complicated implementation plans.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs bias towards instructions that are on the peripheries of the prompt: at the very beginning (the Claude Code system message and &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;), and at the very end (the most-recent user messages)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As instruction count increases, instruction-following quality decreases uniformly. This means that as you give the LLM more instructions, it doesn't simply ignore the newer ("further down in the file") instructions - it begins to ignore all of them uniformly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of the Claude Code harness indicates that Claude Code's system prompt contains ~50 individual instructions. Depending on the model you're using, that's nearly a third of the instructions your agent can reliably follow already - and that's before rules, plugins, skills, or user messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This implies that your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file should contain as few instructions as possible - ideally only ones which are universally applicable to your task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file length &amp;amp; applicability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All else being equal, an LLM will perform better on a task when its' context window is full of focused, relevant context including examples, related files, tool calls, and tool results compared to when its context window has a lot of irrelevant context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; goes into every single session, you should ensure that its contents are as universally applicable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, avoid including instructions about (for example) how to structure a new database schema - this won't matter and will distract the model when you're working on something else that's unrelated!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Length-wise, the less is more principle applies as well. While Anthropic does not have an official recommendation on how long your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file should be, general consensus is that &amp;lt; 300 lines is best, and shorter is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At HumanLayer, our root &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file is less than sixty lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Progressive Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a concise &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file that covers everything you want Claude to know can be challenging, especially in larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this, we can leverage the principle of Progressive Disclosure to ensure that claude only sees task- or project-specific instructions when it needs them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of including all your different instructions about building your project, running tests, code conventions, or other important context in your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file, we recommend keeping task-specific instructions in separate markdown files with self-descriptive names somewhere in your project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;agent_docs/ |- building_the_project.md |- running_tests.md |- code_conventions.md |- service_architecture.md |- database_schema.md |- service_communication_patterns.md&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, in your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file, you can include a list of these files with a brief description of each, and instruct Claude to decide which (if any) are relevant and to read them before it starts working. Or, ask Claude to present you with the files it wants to read for aproval first before reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefer pointers to copies. Don't include code snippets in these files if possible - they will become out-of-date quickly. Instead, include &lt;code&gt;file:line&lt;/code&gt; references to point Claude to the authoritative context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conceptually, this is very similar to how Claude Skills are intended to work, although skills are more focused on tool use than instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Claude is (not) an expensive linter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most common things that we see people put in their &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file is code style guidelines. Never send an LLM to do a linter's job. LLMs are comparably expensive and incredibly slow compared to traditional linters and formatters. We think you should always use deterministic tools whenever you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code style guidelines will inevitably add a bunch of instructions and mostly-irrelevant code snippets into your context window, degrading your LLM's performance and instruction-following and eating up your context window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are in-context learners! If your code follows a certain set of style guidelines or patterns, you should find that armed with a few searches of your codebase (or a good research document!) your agent should tend to follow existing code patterns and conventions without being told to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you feel very stronly about this, you might even consider setting up a Claude Code &lt;code&gt;Stop&lt;/code&gt; hook that runs your formatter &amp;amp; linter and presents errors to Claude for it to fix. Don't make Claude find the formatting issues itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus points: use a linter that can automatically fix issues (we like Biome), and carefully tune your rules about what can safely be auto-fixed for maximum (safe) coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also create a Slash Command that includes your code guidelines and which points claude at the changes in version control, or at your &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;, or similar. This way, you can handle implementation and formatting separately. You will see better results with both as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Don't use &lt;code&gt;/init&lt;/code&gt; or auto-generate your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Claude Code and other harnesses with OpenCode come with ways to auto-generate your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file (or &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; goes into every single session with Claude code, it is one of the highest leverage points of the harness - for better or for worse, depending on how you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bad line of code is a bad line of code. A bad line of an implementation plan has the potential to create a lot of bad lines of code. A bad line of a research that misunderstands how the system works has the potential to result in a lot of bad lines in the plan, and therefore a lot more bad lines of code as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file affects every single phase of your workflow and every single artifact produced by it. As a result, we think you should spend some time thinking very carefully about every single line that goes into it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## In Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;is for onboarding Claude into your codebase. It should define your project's WHY, WHAT, and HOW.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Less (instructions) is more. While you shouldn't omit necessary instructions, you should include as few instructions as reasonably possible in the file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep the contents of your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;concise and universally applicable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use Progressive Disclosure - don't tell Claude all the information you could possibly want it to know. Rather, tell it how to find important information so that it can find and use it, but only when it needs to to avoid bloating your context window or instruction count.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude is not a linter. Use linters and code formatters, and use other features like Hooks and Slash Commands as necessary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;is the highest leverage point of the harness, so avoid auto-generating it. You should carefully craft its contents for best results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computation and Language&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 22 Nov 2022 (v1), last revised 23 Oct 2023 (this version, v4)]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks&lt;/head&gt;View PDF&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Recently, there has been significant progress in teaching language models to perform step-by-step reasoning to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thoughts prompting (CoT) is by far the state-of-art method for these tasks. CoT uses language models to perform both reasoning and computation in the multi-step `thought' process. To disentangle computation from reasoning, we propose `Program of Thoughts' (PoT), which uses language models (mainly Codex) to express the reasoning process as a program. The computation is relegated to an external computer, which executes the generated programs to derive the answer. We evaluate PoT on five math word problem datasets (GSM, AQuA, SVAMP, TabMWP, MultiArith) and three financial-QA datasets (FinQA, ConvFinQA, TATQA) for both few-shot and zero-shot setups. Under both few-shot and zero-shot settings, PoT can show an average performance gain over CoT by around 12\% across all the evaluated datasets. By combining PoT with self-consistency decoding, we can achieve SoTA performance on all math problem datasets and near-SoTA performance on financial datasets.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Love Letter to FreeBSD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear FreeBSD,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still the new person here, learning your ways, stumbling over the occasional quirk, smiling when I find the small touches that make you different. You remind me of what computing felt like before the noise. Before hype cycles and performance theatre. Before every tool needed a plugin system and a logo. You are coherent. You are deliberate. You are the kind of system that doesn’t have to shout to belong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You carry the quiet strength of the greats, like a mainframe humming in a locked room, not chasing attention, just doing its work, year after year. Your base system feels like it was built by people who cared about the whole picture, not just the pieces. Your boot environments are like an old IBM i’s “side A / side B” IPL, a built-in escape hatch that says, we’ve thought ahead for you. You could be, you should be, the open-source mainframe: aligned with hardware lifecycles of three to five years or more, built for long-term trust, a platform people bet their uptime on. Your core design reminds me of Solaris in its best days: a stable base that commercial and community software could rely on without fear of shifting foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And make uptime a design goal: a thousand-day uptime shouldn’t be folklore, it should be normal. Not a party trick, not a screenshot to boast about, but simply the natural consequence of a system built to endure. Mainframes never apologised for uptime measured in years, and neither should you. Apply updates without fear, reboot only when the kernel truly demands it, and let administrators see longevity as a feature, not a gamble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know you are reaching further into the desktop now. I understand why, and I can see how it might widen your reach. But here I find myself wondering: how do you keep the heartbeat of a rock-solid server while also embracing the quicker pulse of a modern desktop? I don’t pretend to have all the answers, I’m too new to you for that, but my first instinct is to lean on what you already have: the natural separation between CURRENT and RELEASE. Let those worlds move at their own pace, without asking one to carry the other’s compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now, with pkgbase in play, the stability of packages matters as much as the base system itself. The base must remain untouchable in its reliability, but I dream of a world where the package ecosystem is available in clear stability channels: from a rock-solid “production tier” you can stake a business on, to faster-moving streams where new features can flow without fear of breaking mission-critical systems. Too many times in the past, packages vanished or broke unexpectedly. I understand the core is sacred, but I wouldn’t mind if some of the wider ecosystem inherited that same level of care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culture matters too. One reason I stepped away from Linux was the noise, the debates that drowned out the joy of building. Please keep FreeBSD the kind of place where thoughtful engineering is welcome without ego battles, where enterprise focus and technical curiosity can sit at the same table. That spirit, the calm, shared purpose that carried Unix from the PDP-11 labs to the backbone of the Internet, is worth protecting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also the practical side: keep the doors open with hardware vendors like Dell and HPE, so FreeBSD remains a first-class citizen. Give me the tools to flash firmware without having to borrow Linux or Windows. Make hardware lifecycle alignment part of your story, major releases paced with the real world, point releases treated as refinement rather than disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My hope is simple: that you stay different. Not in the way that shouts for attention, but in the way that earns trust. If someone wants hype or the latest shiny thing every month, they have Linux. If they want a platform that feels like it could simply run, and keep running, the way the best of Unix always did, they should know they can find it here. And I still dream of a future where a purpose-built “open-source mainframe” exists: a modern, reliable hardware system running FreeBSD with the same quiet presence as Sun’s Enterprise 10k once did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And maybe, one day, someone will walk past a rack of servers, hear the steady, unhurried rhythm of a FreeBSD system still running, and smile, knowing that in a world that burns through trends, there is still something built to last.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With gratitude,&lt;lb/&gt; and with the wish to stay for the long run,&lt;lb/&gt; A newcomer who finally feels at home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bricklink suspends Marketplace operations in 35 countries (developing story)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bricklink, LEGO’s biggest online marketplace and lifeblood of the LEGO community has made quite an alarming announcement. From 12 December 2025, BrickLink Marketplace will not be available for members in 35 countries around the world, which means that LEGO and Bricklink members will no longer be able to buy or sell on the Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Bricklink’s statement and list of countries impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very surprising as the list of countries (listed below) are pretty established, and are home to thousands of AFOLs and LEGO fans, and are pretty mature markets for LEGO all things considered. These include South Africa, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, Egypt, Israel, Taiwan and even huge swathes of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indonesia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turkey&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;South Africa&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taiwan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ukraine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Brazil&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Serbia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Peru&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Israel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;India&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Morocco&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chile&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vietnam&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Georgia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lebanon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Qatar&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oman&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;El Salvador&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bahrain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Armenia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pakistan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Egypt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Moldova&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ecuador&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Argentina&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colombia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Greenland&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;San Marino&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, the total combined population of these countries exceed 2.5 billion, or just about 30% of Earth’s population which is wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a massive shift, and while I understand that Bricklink might have issues operating in some of these countries which are located in remote locations (Greenland), or in a state of war (Ukraine), a blanket ban on these 35 countries with less than 2 weeks notice is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of Bricklink sellers in these countries who run their Bricklink stores as businesses, and rely on the income to support their livelihoods and families, so this really should’ve been communicated far ahead of time. I can’t imagine how stressful this might be to read for sellers in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are LEGO fans in those countries, who will also be barred from buying on Bricklink, which is a whole other level of insane. LEGO fans, and LUGs rely deeply on Bricklink to source elements to express their creativity, as not every country in the world has official LEGO Stores, or access to Pick a Brick online, and Bricklink in some cases are the only way fans can buy LEGO sets too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And these aren’t just any other countries, but countries where LEGO has an official presence in with LEGO Certified Stores, 3rd party retailers, and in the case of the UAE, even a Legoland Park. Oh, and Greenland’s on the list. That Greenland, a Danish territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also recognised LUG communities in these countries as well, so it’s not like The LEGO Group have no interest in nurturing LEGO fans and creativity in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will absolutely smother and stifle LEGO fans and communities in these countries, and I cannot for the life of me understand why such drastic action is required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also ironic as Bricklink celebrated their 25th Anniversary this year, with quite a bit of fanfare, and to close out the year by barring 30% of the world’s population from using the service is in my opinion, an absolute slap in the face of Bricklink founder Dan Jezek, whose vision was to create a global LEGO marketplace and connect fans and elements from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I wrote that it was a terrible idea for LEGO to acquire Bricklink and revisiting some of my thoughts I expressed then, it sure seems like there’s some dodgy stuff happening behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, I acknowledge that there may be compliance challenges operating in some of these countries, where things like local laws, logistics, import restrictions etc may make it difficult for LEGO/Bricklink to do their business there, but surely there could’ve been a better way to communicate this, or invite community feedback instead of turning the whole site off in 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apart from the sudden forum message, there has been no other comment or statement from LEGO or Bricklink about this decision, and with the Bricklink head office based in California, they likely won’t issue more communication on this issue until after the Thanksgiving weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this news upsets you in any way, please share your thoughts by leaving a comment on this post, or if you can manage navigating the extremely archaic Bricklink forums, leave a comment on the Bricklink post announcing this shocking news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See full text below from Bricklink below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear BrickLink members,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve made the difficult decision to stop Marketplace operations in some areas:&lt;lb/&gt;https://www.bricklink.com/help.asp?helpID=2687&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting December 12, 2025, BrickLink members in these countries will no longer&lt;lb/&gt;be able to buy or sell on the Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will review this decision regularly, and we hope to be able to reopen the&lt;lb/&gt;BrickLink Marketplace to LEGO® fans in these countries in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an FAQ for members in these countries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have pending orders. What will happen to them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting December 12, 2025 you will no longer be able to place new orders. Any&lt;lb/&gt;orders placed before that will be processed as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens to my wanted lists?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will still be able to access and manage your wanted lists. If you would like&lt;lb/&gt;to export any of your wanted list, use the ‘Download’ button at the top of the&lt;lb/&gt;page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will I keep my store inventory?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will still be able to access your store inventory, but it’s always a good&lt;lb/&gt;idea to have a copy of your inventory. You can download it using this page: https://www.bricklink.com/invExcel.asp&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We appreciate your understanding,&lt;lb/&gt;The BrickLink Team&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Ly display manager&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ly is a lightweight TUI (ncurses-like) display manager for Linux and BSD, designed with portability in mind (e.g. it does not require systemd to run).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join us on Matrix over at #ly:envs.net!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Development happens on Codeberg with a mirror on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dependencies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compile-time: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;zig 0.15.x&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;libc&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;pam&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;xcb (optional, required by default; needed for X11 support)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Runtime (with default config): &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;xorg&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;xorg-xauth&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;shutdown&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;brightnessctl&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Debian&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# apt install build-essential libpam0g-dev libxcb-xkb-dev xauth xserver-xorg brightnessctl
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fedora&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warning: You may encounter issues with SELinux on Fedora. It is recommended to add a rule for Ly as it currently does not ship one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# dnf install kernel-devel pam-devel libxcb-devel zig xorg-x11-xauth xorg-x11-server brightnessctl
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# pkg install ca_root_nss libxcb git xorg xauth
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ly has been tested with a wide variety of desktop environments and window managers, all of which you can find in the sections below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logs are defined by &lt;code&gt;/etc/ly/config.ini&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The session log is located at &lt;code&gt;~/.local/state/ly-session.log&lt;/code&gt;by default.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The system log is located at &lt;code&gt;/var/log/ly.log&lt;/code&gt;by default.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Manually building&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The procedure for manually building Ly is pretty standard:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://codeberg.org/fairyglade/ly.git
$ cd ly
$ zig build
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After building, you can (optionally) test Ly in a terminal emulator, although authentication will not work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ zig build run
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: While you can also run Ly in a terminal emulator as root, it is not recommended either. If you want to properly test Ly, please enable its service (as described below) and reboot your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following sections show how to install Ly for a particular init system. Because the procedure is very similar for all of them, the commands will only be detailed for the first section (which is about systemd).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: All following sections will assume you are using LightDM for convenience sake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;systemd&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, you can install Ly on your system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installexe -Dinit_system=systemd
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The &lt;code&gt;init_system&lt;/code&gt; parameter is optional and defaults to &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that you also need to disable your current display manager. For example, if LightDM is the current display manager, you can execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# systemctl disable lightdm.service
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, similarly to the previous command, you need to enable the Ly service:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# systemctl enable ly.service
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Because Ly runs in a TTY, you must disable the TTY service that Ly will run on, otherwise bad things will happen. For example, to disable &lt;code&gt;getty&lt;/code&gt; spawning on TTY 2 (the default TTY on which Ly spawns), you need to
execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# systemctl disable getty@tty2.service
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can change the TTY Ly will run on by editing the corresponding service file for your platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OpenRC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installexe -Dinit_system=openrc
# rc-update del lightdm
# rc-update add ly
# rc-update del agetty.tty2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: On Gentoo specifically, you also must comment out the appropriate line for the TTY in /etc/inittab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;runit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installexe -Dinit_system=runit
# rm /var/service/lightdm
# ln -s /etc/sv/ly /var/service/
# rm /var/service/agetty-tty2
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;s6&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installexe -Dinit_system=s6
# s6-rc -d change lightdm
# s6-service add default ly-srv
# s6-db-reload
# s6-rc -u change ly-srv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To disable TTY 2, edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/s6/config/tty2.conf&lt;/code&gt; and set &lt;code&gt;SPAWN="no"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;dinit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installexe -Dinit_system=dinit
# dinitctl disable lightdm
# dinitctl enable ly
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To disable TTY 2, go to &lt;code&gt;/etc/dinit.d/config/console.conf&lt;/code&gt; and modify
&lt;code&gt;ACTIVE_CONSOLES&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;sysvinit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installexe -Dinit_system=sysvinit
# update-rc.d lightdm disable
# update-rc.d ly defaults
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To disable TTY 2, go to &lt;code&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/code&gt; and comment out the line containing &lt;code&gt;tty2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installexe -Dprefix_directory=/usr/local -Dconfig_directory=/usr/local/etc -Dinit_system=freebsd
# sysrc lightdm_enable="NO"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable Ly, add the following entry to &lt;code&gt;/etc/gettytab&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Ly:\
	:lo=/usr/local/bin/ly_wrapper:\
	:al=root:
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, modify the command field of the &lt;code&gt;ttyv1&lt;/code&gt; terminal entry in &lt;code&gt;/etc/ttys&lt;/code&gt;
(TTYs in FreeBSD start at 0):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ttyv1 "/usr/libexec/getty Ly" xterm on secure
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Updating&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also install Ly without overrding the current configuration file. This is called updating. To update, simply run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# zig build installnoconf
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can, of course, still select the init system of your choice when using this command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find all the configuration in &lt;code&gt;/etc/ly/config.ini&lt;/code&gt;. The file is fully
commented, and includes the default values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Controls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the Up/Down arrow keys to change the current field, and the Left/Right arrow keys to scroll through the different fields (whether it be the info line, the desktop environment, or the username). The info line is where messages and errors are displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A note on .xinitrc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your &lt;code&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt; file doesn't work ,make sure it is executable and includes a
shebang. This file is supposed to be a shell script! Quoting from &lt;code&gt;xinit&lt;/code&gt;'s man
page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If no specific client program is given on the command line, xinit will look for a file in the user's home directory called .xinitrc to run as a shell script to start up client programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical shebang for a shell script looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tips&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Use the F1 and F2 keys to respectively shutdown and reboot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take a look at your &lt;code&gt;.xsession&lt;/code&gt;file if X doesn't start, as it can interfere (this file is launched with X to configure the display properly).&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the developer of SmartTube, the most popular alternative YouTube app for Android TV and Fire TV devices, announced that his app’s digital signature had been exposed. A new version of the app using a new digital signature has since been released. While everyone is encouraged to switch to the new app, SmartTube’s developer has shared more information with me about what happened that may make you want to take additional precautions if you’ve installed or updated the app recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SmartTube’s developer told me that the computer used to create the APKs for the project’s official GitHub page was compromised by malware. As a result, some official SmartTube releases were unintentionally released with malware. It’s unclear which version was first affected, but the compromise seems to have first occurred earlier this month. SmartTube versions 30.43 and 30.47 from APKMirror are both being flagged as infected by malware scanners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is likely the presence of this malware that caused Google and Amazon to forcibly uninstall SmartTube on some devices, not the exposed digital signature as first suspected. SmartTube’s developer says the compromised machine has been wiped and is confident that both the new SmartTube releases and the machine that created them are malware-free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All older versions of SmartTube have been removed from the project’s GitHub in an abundance of caution. While there does not appear to be any evidence that the app’s digital signature was actually stolen or used by malicious actors, that too has been abandoned and replaced with a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SmartTube version 30.56 is the first release built by the uncompromised machine and with the new digital signature. It can be installed using my Downloader app by entering code &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It remains unknown what the malware that found its way into the official SmartTube APK files can actually do. Thankfully, SmartTube is programmed to only request minimal account permissions and does not ask for any login information directly. Even if you granted the app access to your Google Drive for backup purposes, your Google account and general Google Drive files remain out of the app’s scope of permissions. Permissions regarding control of your YouTube account seem like the only thing that could have easily been exposed to the malware, as far as account access is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, since very little is know about the malware, you should assume the worst. If you use SmartTube and are concerned about your exposure to this malware, you should factory reset any device that had the app installed, especially if you installed or updated the app in November. It would also be a good idea to audit your Google account permissions and your YouTube account activity for anything unusual. Once your devices and account are in order, if you wish to reinstall SmartTube, be sure to only install the latest version through the codes/links above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;It’s been a very hard year&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a lot of places in tech, my company, Set Studio/Piccalilli has no outside funding. Bootstrapped is what the LinkedIn people say, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a hard year this year. A very hard year. I think a naive person would blame it all on the seemingly industry-wide attitude of “AI can just do this for us”. While that certainly hasn’t helped — as I see it — it’s been a hard year because of a combination of limping economies, tariffs, even more political instability and a severe cost of living crisis. It’s been a very similar year to 2020, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why am I writing this? All of the above has had a really negative effect on us this year. Landing projects for Set Studio has been extremely difficult, especially as we won’t work on product marketing for AI stuff, from a moral standpoint, but the vast majority of enquiries have been for exactly that. Our reputation is everything, so being associated with that technology as it increasingly shows us what it really is, would be a terrible move for the long term. I wouldn’t personally be able to sleep knowing I’ve contributed to all of that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we do really well is produce websites and design systems that actually work for and with people. We also share our knowledge and experience via tonnes of free content on Piccalilli, funded by premium courses to keep the lights on. We don’t pepper our content with annoying adverts for companies you have no interest in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve spoken about my dream for us to run Piccalilli full time and heck, that may still happen. For that to happen though, we really needed this Black Friday period to do as well, if not better, as it did last year. So far, that’s not happening unfortunately, but there’s still time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get it, money is so tight this year and companies are seemingly not investing in staff with training budgets quite like they did. We actually tried to stem that a bit by trialing a community funding model earlier in the year that I outlined in I’m getting fed up of making the rich, richer and we even started publishing some stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It went down incredibly well, but when push came to shove, we fell way short in terms of funding support. Like I say, we’re not swimming in investor money, so without the support on Open Collective, as much as it hurt, we had to pull the plug. It’s a real shame — that would have been incredible — but again, I get it, money is tight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t a woe is me post; that’s not how I roll. This is a post to give some context for what I’m going to ask next and how I’m trying to navigate the tough times. I’m asking folks to help us so we can try to help everyone, whether that’s with web projects that actually work for people or continuing to produce extremely high quality education material. Here’s some ways you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Take advantage of our Black Friday deals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll see messaging like “this is the most important time of year for us” and it’s extremely true. To break the fourth wall slightly, people buying courses at full price is a lot rarer than you might think. So often, discount events are what keeps the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve launched two courses this year — JavaScript for Everyone and Mindful Design — that sit alongside my course, Complete CSS, which we launched last year. I know you’ve probably been burned by shit courses in the past, but these three courses are far from that. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how much Mat (JavaScript for Everyone) and Scott (Mindful Design) have put in to these courses this year. These two are elite level individuals with incredible reputations and they’ve shared a seemingly impossible amount of extremely high quality knowledge in their courses. I would definitely recommend giving them your time and support because they really will transform you for the better. For bosses reading this, all three courses will pay themselves back ten-fold — especially when you take advantage of bulk discounts — trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Share our courses and our studio with your network&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So many of you have purchased courses already and I’m forever thankful for that. I can’t stand the term “social proof” but it works. People might be on the fence about grabbing a course, and seeing one of their peers talk about how good it was can be the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might think it’s not worth posting about the courses on social media but people do see it, especially on platforms like Bluesky with their custom feeds. We see it too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testimonials are always welcome because we can pop those on the course marketing pages, just like on mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of sharing the studio, if you think we’re cool, post about it! It’s all about eyes and nice words. We’ll do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hire Set Studio for projects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re really good at what we do! I know every studio/agency says this, but we’re different. We’re actually different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re not going to charge you through the nose for substandard work — only deploying a fraction of our team, like a lot of agencies do. I set this studio up to be the antithesis of the way these — and I’ll say it out loud — charlatans operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our whole focus is becoming your partners so you can do the — y’know — running of your business/organisation and we take the load off your shoulders. We’re hyper efficient and we fully own projects because they’re way above your normal duties. We get that. In fact, the most efficient way to get the most out of a studio like ours is to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know “numbers goes up” is really important and yes, numbers definitely go up when we work with you. We do that without exploiting your users and customers too. There’s no deceptive patterns coming from us. We instead put everything into branding, messaging, content architecture and making everything extremely fast and accessible. That’s what makes the numbers go up for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re incredibly fairly priced too. We’re not in the business of charging ridiculous fees for our work. We’re only a small team, so our overheads are nothing compared to a lot of agencies. We carry your budgets a long way for you and genuinely give you more bang for your buck with an equitable pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve got availability starting from the new year because starting projects in December is never the ideal way to do things. Getting those projects planned and ready to go is a good idea in December though, so get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also slowly getting back into CSS and front-end consulting. I’ve helped some of the largest organisations and the smallest organisations, such as Harley-Davidson, the NHS and Google write better code and work better together. Again, starting in the new year I’ll have availability for consulting and engineering support. It might just be a touch more palatable than hiring the whole studio for you. Again, get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m always transparent — maybe too transparent at times — but it’s really important for me to be honest. Man, we need more honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s taken a lot of pride-swallowing to write this but I think it’s more important to be honest than to be unnecessarily proud. I know this will be read by someone else who’s finding the year hard, so if anything, I’m really glad they’ll feel seen at least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting good leads is harder than ever, so I’d really appreciate people sharing this with their network. You’ll never regret recommending Piccalilli courses or Set Studio. In fact, you’ll look really good at what you do when we absolutely smash it out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and if you’re also struggling, I’m sending as much strength your way as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;DeepSeekMath-V2: Towards Self-Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute. While much work remains, these results suggest that self-verifiable mathematical reasoning is a feasible research direction that may help develop more capable mathematical AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
