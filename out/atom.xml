    &lt;p&gt;I mainly use my MacBook M1 Pro with Apple Silicon for work. Recently I’ve had a few weeks off. It’s been sitting in my laptop bag waiting for me to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I’m back to work tomorrow I got it out to see if it was charged enough for the train journey in the morning. 90% remaining. After 3 weeks. It wasn’t turned off, just closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, my Framework 13 with an AMD Ryzen 7840HS is almost always dead when I go to use it. It’s very frustrating. I’m not using it every day so it often goes 2-3 days without being opened. I haven’t measured it but I read that I should expect it to lose 3-4% in suspend every hour. Is that a joke?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was running Fedora Workstation on the 13 for a long while until I had a short stint with Arch Linux. It wasn’t stable enough so now I’m on Fedora Silverblue which has been delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the Framework’s battery life continues to be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a true believer of Framework’s mission. The technology is awesome. But why is the battery life of modern laptops (other than Apple Silicon) so bad? I don’t think it’s unique to Framework, but it affects my love for this groundbreaking device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple Silicon is built upon ARM64 which is apparently core to such great battery life. Do I need to get an ARM mainboard as soon as Framework offers it as an upgrade? I’m not sure. It appears to be way more complicated than just switching to ARM64.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still love my Framework, despite its flaws. I will just keep it plugged in so that it’s ready to go when I want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we believe that helping build a better Internet means encouraging a healthy ecosystem of options for how people can connect safely and quickly to the resources they need. Sometimes that means we tackle immense, Internet-scale problems with established partners. And sometimes that means we support and partner with fantastic open teams taking big bets on the next generation of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To that end, today we are excited to announce our support of two independent, open source projects: Ladybird, an ambitious project to build a completely independent browser from the ground up, and Omarchy, an opinionated Arch Linux setup for developers.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two open source projects strengthening the open InternetÂ &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has a long history of supporting open-source software â both through our own projects shared with the community and external projects that we support. We see our sponsorship of Ladybird and Omarchy as a natural extension of these efforts in a moment where energy for a diverse ecosystem is needed more than ever.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ladybird, a new and independent browserÂ &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most of us spend a significant amount of time using a web browser âÂ in fact, youâre probably using one to read this blog! The beauty of browsers is that they help users experience the open Internet, giving you access to everything from the largest news publications in the world to a tiny website hosted on a Raspberry Pi.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unlike dedicated apps, browsers reduce the barriers to building an audience for new services and communities on the Internet. If you are launching something new, you can offer it through a browser in a world where most people have absolutely zero desire to install an app just to try something out. Browsers help encourage competition and new ideas on the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While the openness of how browsers work has led to an explosive growth of services on the Internet, browsers themselves have consolidated to a tiny handful of viable options. Thereâs a high probability youâre reading this on a Chromium-based browser, like Googleâs Chrome, along with about 65% of users on the Internet. However, that consolidation has also scared off new entrants in the space. If all browsers ship on the same operating systems, powered by the same underlying technology, we lose out on potential privacy, security and performance innovations that could benefit developers and everyday Internet users.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Cloudflare Workers developer docs in LadybirdÂ &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is where Ladybird comes in: itâs not Chromium based â everything is built from scratch. The Ladybird project has two main components: LibWeb, a brand-new rendering engine, and LibJS, a brand-new JavaScript engine with its own parser, interpreter, and bytecode execution engine.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Building an engine that can correctly and securely render the modern web is a monumental task that requires deep technical expertise and navigating decades of specifications governed by standards bodies like the W3C and WHATWG. And because Ladybird implements these standards directly, it also stress-tests them in practice. Along the way, the project has found, reported, and sometimes fixed countless issues in the specifications themselves, contributions that strengthen the entire web platform for developers, browser vendors, and anyone who may attempt to build a browser in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Whether to build something from scratch or not is a perennial source of debate between software engineers, but absent the pressures of revenue or special interests, weâre excited about the ways Ladybird will prioritize privacy, performance, and security, potentially in novel ways that will influence the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of the Omarchy development environment&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Omarchy, an independent development environmentÂ &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Developers deserve choice, too. Beyond the browser, a developerâs operating system and environment is where they spend a ton of time â and where a few big players have become the dominant choice. Omarchy challenges this by providing a complete, opinionated Arch Linux distribution that transforms a bare installation into a modern development workstation that developers are excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perfecting oneâs development environment can be a career-long art, but learning how to do so shouldnât be a barrier to beginning to code. The beauty of Omarchy is that it makes Linux approachable to more developers by doing most of the setup for them, making it look good, and then making it configurable. Omarchy provides most of the tools developers need â like Neovim, Docker, and Git â out of the box, and tons of other features.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At its core, Omarchy embraces Linux for all of its complexity and configurability, and makes a version of it that is accessible and fun to use for developers that donât have a deep background in operating systems. Projects like this ensure that a powerful, independent Linux desktop remains a compelling choice for people building the next generation of applications and Internet infrastructure.Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our support comes with no strings attachedÂ Â &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to be very clear here: we are supporting these projects because we believe the Internet can be better if these projects, and more like them, succeed. No requirement to use our technology stack or any arrangement like that. We are happy to partner with great teams like Ladybird and Omarchy simply because we believe that our missions have real overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ladybird is still in its early days, with an alpha release planned for 2026, but we encourage anyone who is interested to consider contributing to the open source codebase as they prepare for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Cloudflare knows what it means to build critical web infrastructure on the server side. With Ladybird, weâre tackling the near-monoculture on the client side, because we believe it needs multiple implementations to stay healthy, and weâre extremely thankful for their support in that mission.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â Andreas Kling, Founder, LadybirdÂ Â &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Omarchy 3.0 was released just last week with faster installation and increased Macbook compatibility, so if youâve been Linux-curious for a while now, we encourage you to try it out!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Cloudflare's support of Omarchy has ensured we have the fastest ISO and package delivery from wherever you are in the world. Without a need to manually configure mirrors or deal with torrents. The combo of a super CDN, great R2 storage, and the best DDoS shield in the business has been a huge help for the project."&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;â David Heinemeier Hansson, Creator of Omarchy and Ruby on Rails&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A better Internet is one where people have more choice in how they browse and develop new software. Weâre incredibly excited about the potential of Ladybird, Omarchy, and other audacious projects that support a free and open Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Allow us to introduce Cap'n Web, an RPC protocol and implementation in pure TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is a spiritual sibling to Cap'n Proto, an RPC protocol I (Kenton) created a decade ago, but designed to play nice in the web stack. That means:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Like Cap'n Proto, it is an object-capability protocol. ("Cap'n" is short for "capabilities and".) We'll get into this more below, but it's incredibly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web has no schemas. In fact, it has almost no boilerplate whatsoever. This means it works more like the JavaScript-native RPC system in Cloudflare Workers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That said, it integrates nicely with TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Also unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web's underlying serialization is human-readable. In fact, it's just JSON, with a little pre-/post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It works over HTTP, WebSocket, and postMessage() out-of-the-box, with the ability to extend it to other transports easily.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It works in all major browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, and other modern JavaScript runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The whole thing compresses (minify+gzip) to under 10Â kB with no dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It's open source under the MIT license.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is more expressive than almost every other RPC system, because it implements an object-capability RPC model. That means it:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports bidirectional calling. The client can call the server, and the server can also call the client.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports passing functions by reference: If you pass a function over RPC, the recipient receives a "stub". When they call the stub, they actually make an RPC back to you, invoking the function where it was created. This is how bidirectional calling happens: the client passes a callback to the server, and then the server can call it later.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Similarly, supports passing objects by reference: If a class extends the special marker type &lt;code&gt;RpcTarget&lt;/code&gt;, then instances of that class are passed by reference, with method calls calling back to the location where the object was created.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports promise pipelining. When you start an RPC, you get back a promise. Instead of awaiting it, you can immediately use the promise in dependent RPCs, thus performing a chain of calls in a single network round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Supports capability-based security patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In short, Cap'n Web lets you design RPC interfaces the way you'd design regular JavaScript APIs â while still acknowledging and compensating for network latency.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The best part is, Cap'n Web is absolutely trivial to set up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A client looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { newWebSocketRpcSession } from "capnweb";

// One-line setup.
let api = newWebSocketRpcSession("wss://example.com/api");

// Call a method on the server!
let result = await api.hello("World");

console.log(result);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And here's a complete Cloudflare Worker implementing an RPC server:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { RpcTarget, newWorkersRpcResponse } from "capnweb";

// This is the server implementation.
class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}

// Standard Workers HTTP handler.
export default {
  fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Parse URL for routing.
    let url = new URL(request.url);

    // Serve API at `/api`.
    if (url.pathname === "/api") {
      return newWorkersRpcResponse(request, new MyApiServer());
    }

    // You could serve other endpoints here...
    return new Response("Not found", {status: 404});
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the app.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can add more methods to &lt;code&gt;MyApiServer&lt;/code&gt;, and call them from the client.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can have the client pass a callback function to the server, and then the server can just call it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can define a TypeScript interface for your API, and easily apply it to the client and server.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It just works.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why RPC? (And what is RPC anyway?)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are a way of expressing communications between two programs over a network. Without RPC, you might communicate using a protocol like HTTP. With HTTP, though, you must format and parse your communications as an HTTP request and response, perhaps designed in REST style. RPC systems try to make communications look like a regular function call instead, as if you were calling a library rather than a remote service. The RPC system provides a "stub" object on the client side which stands in for the real server-side object. When a method is called on the stub, the RPC system figures out how to serialize and transmit the parameters to the server, invoke the method on the server, and then transmit the return value back.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The merits of RPC have been subject to a great deal of debate. RPC is often accused of committing many of the fallacies of distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But this reputation is outdated. When RPC was first invented some 40 years ago, async programming barely existed. We did not have Promises, much less async and await. Early RPC was synchronous: calls would block the calling thread waiting for a reply. At best, latency made the program slow. At worst, network failures would hang or crash the program. No wonder it was deemed "broken".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Things are different today. We have Promise and async and await, and we can throw exceptions on network failures. We even understand how RPCs can be pipelined so that a chain of calls takes only one network round trip. Many large distributed systems you likely use every day are built on RPC. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fact is, RPC fits the programming model we're used to. Every programmer is trained to think in terms of APIs composed of function calls, not in terms of byte stream protocols nor even REST. Using RPC frees you from the need to constantly translate between mental models, allowing you to move faster.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When should you use Cap'n Web?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is useful anywhere where you have two JavaScript applications speaking to each other over a network, including client-to-server and microservice-to-microservice scenarios. However, it is particularly well-suited to interactive web applications with real-time collaborative features, as well as modeling interactions over complex security boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is still new and experimental, so for now, a willingness to live on the cutting edge may also be required!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Features, features, featuresâ¦&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's some more things you can do with Cap'n Web.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sometimes a WebSocket connection is a bit too heavyweight. What if you just want to make a quick one-time batch of calls, but don't need an ongoing connection?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For that, Cap'n Web supports HTTP batch mode:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;import { newHttpBatchRpcSession } from "capnweb";

let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

let result = await batch.hello("World");

console.log(result);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(The server is exactly the same as before.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that once you've awaited an RPC in the batch, the batch is done, and all the remote references received through it become broken. To make more calls, you need to start over with a new batch. However, you can make multiple calls in a single batch:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

// We can call make multiple calls, as long as we await them all at once.
let promise1 = batch.hello("Alice");
let promise2 = batch.hello("Bob");

let [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);

console.log(result1);
console.log(result2);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And that brings us to another featureâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Chained calls (Promise Pipelining)&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's where things get magical.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In both batch mode and WebSocket mode, you can make a call that depends on the result of another call, without waiting for the first call to finish. In batch mode, that means you can, in a single batch, call a method, then use its result in another call. The entire batch still requires only one network round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, say your API is:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  getMyName() {
    return "Alice";
  }

  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can do:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let namePromise = batch.getMyName();
let result = await batch.hello(namePromise);

console.log(result);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Notice the initial call to &lt;code&gt;getMyName()&lt;/code&gt; returned a promise, but we used the promise itself as the input to &lt;code&gt;hello()&lt;/code&gt;, without awaiting it first. With Cap'n Web, this just works: The client sends a message to the server saying: "Please insert the result of the first call into the parameters of the second."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the first call returns an object with methods. You can call the methods immediately, without awaiting the first promise, like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

// Authencitate the API key, returning a Session object.
let sessionPromise = batch.authenticate(apiKey);

// Get the user's name.
let name = await sessionPromise.whoami();

console.log(name);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This works because the promise returned by a Cap'n Web call is not a regular promise. Instead, it's a JavaScript Proxy object. Any methods you call on it are interpreted as speculative method calls on the eventual result. These calls are sent to the server immediately, telling the server: "When you finish the call I sent earlier, call this method on what it returns."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did you spot the security?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This last example shows an important security pattern enabled by Cap'n Web's object-capability model.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When we call the authenticate() method, after it has verified the provided API key, it returns an authenticated session object. The client can then make further RPCs on the session object to perform operations that require authorization as that user. The server code might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  authenticate(apiKey) {
    let username = await checkApiKey(apiKey);
    return new AuthenticatedSession(username);
  }
}

class AuthenticatedSession extends RpcTarget {
  constructor(username) {
    super();
    this.username = username;
  }

  whoami() {
    return this.username;
  }

  // ...other methods requiring auth...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's what makes this work: It is impossible for the client to "forge" a session object. The only way to get one is to call authenticate(), and have it return successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In most RPC systems, it is not possible for one RPC to return a stub pointing at a new RPC object in this way. Instead, all functions are top-level, and can be called by anyone. In such a traditional RPC system, it would be necessary to pass the API key again to every function call, and check it again on the server each time. Or, you'd need to do authorization outside the RPC system entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a common pain point for WebSockets in particular. Due to the design of the web APIs for WebSocket, you generally cannot use headers nor cookies to authorize them. Instead, authorization must happen in-band, by sending a message over the WebSocket itself. But this can be annoying for RPC protocols, as it means the authentication message is "special" and changes the state of the connection itself, affecting later calls. This breaks the abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The authenticate() pattern shown above neatly makes authentication fit naturally into the RPC abstraction. It's even type-safe: you can't possibly forget to authenticate before calling a method requiring auth, because you wouldn't have an object on which to make the call. Speaking of type-safetyâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you use TypeScript, Cap'n Web plays nicely with it. You can declare your RPC API once as a TypeScript interface, implement in on the server, and call it on the client:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;// Shared interface declaration:
interface MyApi {
  hello(name: string): Promise&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;;
}

// On the client:
let api: RpcStub&amp;lt;MyApi&amp;gt; = newWebSocketRpcSession("wss://example.com/api");

// On the server:
class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget implements MyApi {
  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now you get end-to-end type checking, auto-completed method names, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that, as always with TypeScript, no type checks occur at runtime. The RPC system itself does not prevent a malicious client from calling an RPC with parameters of the wrong type. This is, of course, not a problem unique to Cap'n Web â JSON-based APIs have always had this problem. You may wish to use a runtime type-checking system like Zod to solve this. (Meanwhile, we hope to add type checking based directly on TypeScript types in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An alternative to GraphQL?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If youâve used GraphQL before, you might notice some similarities. One benefit of GraphQL was to solve the âwaterfallâ problem of traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to ask for multiple pieces of data in one query. For example, instead of making three sequential HTTP calls:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;GET /user
GET /user/friends
GET /user/friends/photos&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;â¦you can write one GraphQL query to fetch it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thatâs a big improvement over REST, but GraphQL comes with its own tradeoffs:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;New language and tooling. You have to adopt GraphQLâs schema language, servers, and client libraries. If your team is all-in on JavaScript, thatâs a lot of extra machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Limited composability. GraphQL queries are declarative, which makes them great for fetching data, but awkward for chaining operations or mutations. For example, you canât easily say: âcreate a user, then immediately use that new user object to make a friend request, all-in-one round trip.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Different abstraction model. GraphQL doesnât look or feel like the JavaScript APIs you already know. Youâre learning a new mental model rather than extending the one you use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Cap'n Web goes further&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web solves the waterfall problem without introducing a new language or ecosystem. Itâs just JavaScript. Because Cap'n Web supports promise pipelining and object references, you can write code that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let user = api.createUser({ name: "Alice" });
let friendRequest = await user.sendFriendRequest("Bob");&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What happens under the hood? Both calls are pipelined into a single network round trip:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Create the user.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Take the result of that call (a new User object).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Immediately invoke sendFriendRequest() on that object.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All of this is expressed naturally in JavaScript, with no schemas, query languages, or special tooling required. You just call methods and pass objects around, like you would in any other JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In other words, GraphQL gave us a way to flatten RESTâs waterfalls. Cap'n Web lets us go even further: it gives you the power to model complex interactions exactly the way you would in a normal program, with no impedance mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But how do we solve arrays?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With everything we've presented so far, there's a critical missing piece to seriously consider Cap'n Web as an alternative to GraphQL: handling lists. Often, GraphQL is used to say: "Perform this query, and then, for every result, perform this other query." For example: "List the user's friends, and then for each one, fetch their profile photo."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In short, we need an &lt;code&gt;array.map()&lt;/code&gt; operation that can be performed without adding a round trip.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Proto, historically, has never supported such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But with Cap'n Web, we've solved it. You can do:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let user = api.authenticate(token);

// Get the user's list of friends (an array).
let friendsPromise = user.listFriends();

// Do a .map() to annotate each friend record with their photo.
// This operates on the *promise* for the friends list, so does not
// add a round trip.
// (wait WHAT!?!?)
let friendsWithPhotos = friendsPromise.map(friend =&amp;gt; {
  return {friend, photo: api.getUserPhoto(friend.id))};
}

// Await the friends list with attached photos -- one round trip!
let results = await friendsWithPhotos;
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; takes a callback function, which needs to be applied to each element in the array. As we described earlier, normally when you pass a function to an RPC, the function is passed "by reference", meaning that the remote side receives a stub, where calling that stub makes an RPC back to the client where the function was created.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But that is NOT what is happening here. That would defeat the purpose: we don't want the server to have to round-trip to the client to process every member of the array. We want the server to just apply the transformation server-side.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To that end, &lt;code&gt;.map() &lt;/code&gt;is special. It does not send JavaScript code to the server, but it does send something like "code", restricted to a domain-specific, non-Turing-complete language. The "code" is a list of instructions that the server should carry out for each member of the array. In this case, the instructions are:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Invoke &lt;code&gt;api.getUserPhoto(friend.id)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Return an object &lt;code&gt;{friend, photo}&lt;/code&gt;, where friend is the original array element and photo is the result of step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But the application code just specified a JavaScript method. How on Earth could we convert this into the narrow DSL?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The answer is record-replay: On the client side, we execute the callback once, passing in a special placeholder value. The parameter behaves like an RPC promise. However, the callback is required to be synchronous, so it cannot actually await this promise. The only thing it can do is use promise pipelining to make pipelined calls. These calls are intercepted by the implementation and recorded as instructions, which can then be sent to the server, where they can be replayed as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And because the recording is based on promise pipelining, which is what the RPC protocol itself is designed to represent, it turns out that the "DSL" used to represent "instructions" for the map function is just the RPC protocol itself. ð¤¯&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web's underlying protocol is based on JSON â but with a preprocessing step to handle special types. Arrays are treated as "escape sequences" that let us encode other values. For example, JSON does not have an encoding for &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; objects, but Cap'n Web does. You might see a message that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;{
  event: "Birthday Week",
  timestamp: ["date", 1758499200000]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To encode a literal array, we simply double-wrap it in &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;{
  names: [["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In other words, an array with just one element which is itself an array, evaluates to the inner array literally. An array whose first element is a type name, evaluates to an instance of that type, where the remaining elements are parameters to the type.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that only a fixed set of types are supported: essentially, "structured clonable" types, and RPC stub types.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On top of this basic encoding, we define an RPC protocol inspired by Cap'n Proto â but greatly simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since Cap'n Web is a symmetric protocol, there is no well-defined "client" or "server" at the protocol level. There are just two parties exchanging messages across a connection. Every kind of interaction can happen in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In order to make it easier to describe these interactions, I will refer to the two parties as "Alice" and "Bob".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob start the connection by establishing some sort of bidirectional message stream. This may be a WebSocket, but Cap'n Web also allows applications to define their own transports. Each message in the stream is JSON-encoded, as described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alice and Bob each maintain some state about the connection. In particular, each maintains an "export table", describing all the pass-by-reference objects they have exposed to the other side, and an "import table", describing the references they have received. Alice's exports correspond to Bob's imports, and vice versa. Each entry in the export table has a signed integer ID, which is used to reference it. You can think of these IDs like file descriptors in a POSIX system. Unlike file descriptors, though, IDs can be negative, and an ID is never reused over the lifetime of a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At the start of the connection, Alice and Bob each populate their export tables with a single entry, numbered zero, representing their "main" interfaces. Typically, when one side is acting as the "server", they will export their main public RPC interface as ID zero, whereas the "client" will export an empty interface. However, this is up to the application: either side can export whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From there, new exports are added in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When Alice sends a message to Bob that contains within it an object or function reference, Alice adds the target object to her export table. IDs assigned in this case are always negative, starting from -1 and counting downwards.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Alice can send a "push" message to Bob to request that Bob add a value to his export table. The "push" message contains an expression which Bob evaluates, exporting the result. Usually, the expression describes a method call on one of Bob's existing exports â this is how an RPC is made. Each "push" is assigned a positive ID on the export table, starting from 1 and counting upwards. Since positive IDs are only assigned as a result of pushes, Alice can predict the ID of each push she makes, and can immediately use that ID in subsequent messages. This is how promise pipelining is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After sending a push message, Alice can subsequently send a "pull" message, which tells Bob that once he is done evaluating the "push", he should proactively serialize the result and send it back to Alice, as a "resolve" (or "reject") message. However, this is optional: Alice may not actually care to receive the return value of an RPC, if Alice only wants to use it in promise pipelining. In fact, the Cap'n Web implementation will only send a "pull" message if the application has actually awaited the returned promise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Putting it together, a code sequence like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;let namePromise = api.getMyName();
let result = await api.hello(namePromise);

console.log(result);&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Might produce a message exchange like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;// Call api.getByName(). `api` is the server's main export, so has export ID 0.
-&amp;gt; ["push", ["pipeline", 0, "getMyName", []]
// Call api.hello(namePromise). `namePromise` refers to the result of the first push,
// so has ID 1.
-&amp;gt; ["push", ["pipeline", 0, "hello", [["pipeline", 1]]]]
// Ask that the result of the second push be proactively serialized and returned.
-&amp;gt; ["pull", 2]
// Server responds.
&amp;lt;- ["resolve", 2, "Hello, Alice!"]&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For more details about the protocol, check out the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cap'n Web is new and still highly experimental. There may be bugs to shake out. But, we're already using it today. Cap'n Web is the basis of the recently-launched "remote bindings" feature in Wrangler, allowing a local test instance of workerd to speak RPC to services in production. We've also begun to experiment with it in various frontend applications â expect more blog posts on this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In any case, Cap'n Web is open source, and you can start using it in your own projects now.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Check it out on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;OpenAI and NVIDIA announce strategic partnership to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strategic partnership enables OpenAI to build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters with NVIDIA systems representing millions of GPUs for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To support the partnership, NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026 on NVIDIA’s Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;San Francisco and Santa Clara—September 22, 2025—NVIDIA and OpenAI today announced a letter of intent for a landmark strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure to train and run its next generation of models on the path to deploying superintelligence. To support this deployment including datacenter and power capacity, NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed. The first phase is targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using NVIDIA’s Vera Rubin platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everything starts with compute,” said Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve been working closely with NVIDIA since the early days of OpenAI,” said Greg Brockman, co-founder and President of OpenAI. “We’ve utilized their platform to create AI systems that hundreds of millions of people use every day. We’re excited to deploy 10 gigawatts of compute with NVIDIA to push back the frontier of intelligence and scale the benefits of this technology to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI will work with NVIDIA as a preferred strategic compute and networking partner for its AI factory growth plans. OpenAI and NVIDIA will work together to co-optimize their roadmaps for OpenAI's model and infrastructure software and NVIDIA’s hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This partnership complements the deep work OpenAI and NVIDIA are already doing with a broad network of collaborators, including Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank, and Stargate partners, focused on building the world’s most advanced AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has grown to over 700 million weekly active users and strong adoption across global enterprises, small businesses, and developers. This partnership will help OpenAI advance its mission to build artificial general intelligence that benefits all of humanity.&lt;lb/&gt;NVIDIA and OpenAI look forward to finalizing the details of this new phase of strategic partnership in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;People should spend less time learning DSA, more time learning testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see new learners asking about “DSA” a lot. Data Structures and Algorithms are of course important: considered broadly, they are the two ingredients that make up all programs. But in my opinion, “DSA” as an abstract field of study is over-emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I understand why people focus on DSA: it’s a concrete thing to learn about, there are web sites devoted to testing you on it, and most importantly, because job interviews often involve DSA coding questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I get to other opinions, let me make clear that anything you can do to help you get a job is a good thing to do. If grinding leetcode will land you a position, then do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I hope companies hiring entry-level engineers aren’t asking them to reverse linked lists or balance trees. Asking about techniques that can be memorized ahead of time won’t tell them anything about how well you can work. The stated purpose of those interviews is to see how well you can figure out solutions, in which case memorization will defeat the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing new learners don’t understand about DSA is that actual software engineering almost never involves implementing the kinds of algorithms that “DSA” teaches you. Sure, it can be helpful to work through some of these puzzles and see how they are solved, but writing real code just doesn’t involve writing that kind of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what I think in-the-trenches software engineers should know about data structures and algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Data structures are ways to organize data. Learn some of the basics: linked list, array, hash table, tree. By “learn” I mean understand what it does and why you might want to use one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Different data structures can be used to organize the same data in different ways. Learn some of the trade-offs between structures that are similar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algorithms are ways of manipulating data. I don’t mean named algorithms like Quicksort, but algorithms as any chunk of code that works on data and does something with it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How you organize data affects what algorithms you can use to work with the data. Some data structures will be slow for some operations where another structure will be fast.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algorithms have a “time complexity” (Big O): how the code slows as the data grows. Get a sense of what this means.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python has a number of built-in data structures. Learn how they work, and the time complexity of their operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn how to think about your code to understand its time complexity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read a little about more esoteric things like Bloom filters, so you can find them later in the unlikely case you need them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some things you don’t need to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The details of a dozen different sorting algorithms. Look at two to see different ways of approaching the same problem, then move on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The names of “important” algorithms. Those have all been implemented for you.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The answers to all N problems on some quiz web site. You won’t be asked these exact questions, and they won’t come up in your real work. Again: try a few to get a feel for how some algorithms work. The exact answers are not what you need.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course some engineers need to implement hash tables, or sorting algorithms or whatever. We love those engineers: they write libraries we can use off the shelf so we don’t have to implement them ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been times when I implemented something that felt like An Algorithm (for example, Finding fuzzy floats), but it was more about considering another perspective on my data, looking at the time complexity, and moving operations around to avoid quadratic behavior. It wasn’t opening a textbook to find the famous algorithm that would solve my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again: if it will help you get a job, deep-study DSA. But don’t be disappointed when you don’t use it on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to prepare yourself for a career, and also stand out in job interviews, learn how to write tests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This will be a skill you use constantly. Real-world software means writing tests much more than school teaches you to.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a job search, testing experience will stand out more than DSA depth. It shows you’ve thought about what it takes to write high-quality software instead of just academic exercises.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s not obvious how to test code well. It’s a puzzle and a problem to solve. If you like figuring out solutions to tricky questions, focus on how to write code so that it can be tested, and how to test it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing not only gives you more confidence in your code, it helps you write better code in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing applies everywhere, from tiny bits of code to entire architectures, assisting you in design and implementation at all scales.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If pursued diligently, testing is an engineering discipline in its own right, with a fascinating array of tools and techniques.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less DSA, more testing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We release Qwen3-Omni, the natively end-to-end multilingual omni-modal foundation models. It is designed to process diverse inputs including text, images, audio, and video, while delivering real-time streaming responses in both text and natural speech. Click the video below for more information 😃&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2025.09.22: 🎉🎉🎉 We have released Qwen3-Omni. For more details, please check our blog!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Omni is the natively end-to-end multilingual omni-modal foundation models. It processes text, images, audio, and video, and delivers real-time streaming responses in both text and natural speech. We introduce several architectural upgrades to improve performance and efficiency. Key features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art across modalities: Early text-first pretraining and mixed multimodal training provide native multimodal support. While achieving strong audio and audio-video results, unimodal text and image performance does not regress. Reaches SOTA on 22 of 36 audio/video benchmarks and open-source SOTA on 32 of 36; ASR, audio understanding, and voice conversation performance is comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multilingual: Supports 119 text languages, 19 speech input languages, and 10 speech output languages.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Speech Input: English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, German, Russian, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Dutch, Indonesian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Arabic, Urdu.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Speech Output: English, Chinese, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Novel Architecture: MoE-based Thinker–Talker design with AuT pretraining for strong general representations, plus a multi-codebook design that drives latency to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Real-time Audio/Video Interaction: Low-latency streaming with natural turn-taking and immediate text or speech responses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Flexible Control: Customize behavior via system prompts for fine-grained control and easy adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Detailed Audio Captioner: Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner is now open source: a general-purpose, highly detailed, low-hallucination audio captioning model that fills a critical gap in the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Omni supports a wide range of multimodal application scenarios, covering various domain tasks involving audio, image, video, and audio-visual modalities. Below are several cookbooks demonstrating the usage cases of Qwen3-Omni and these cookbooks include our actual execution logs. You can first follow the QuickStart guide to download the model and install the necessary inference environment dependencies, then run and experiment locally—try modifying prompts or switching model types, and enjoy exploring the capabilities of Qwen3-Omni!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Downstream Task Fine-tuning&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Omni Captioner&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Introduction and capability demonstration of Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, a downstream fine-tuned model based on Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct, illustrating the strong generalization ability of the Qwen3-Omni foundation model.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we provide several methods to quickly get started with Qwen3-Omni. If you want complete experience of Qwen3-Omni, you can use Hugging Face Transformers. However, since Qwen3-Omni employs an MoE architecture, inference speed with Hugging Face Transformers on MoE models can be very slow. For large-scale invocation or low-latency requirements, we highly recommend using vLLM or performing inference via the DashScope API. We also strongly suggest using our provided Docker image, which includes a complete runtime environment for both Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. In addition, our cookbooks offer some use cases to show Qwen3-Omni's capabilities. Welcome to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is the description of all Qwen3-Omni models. Please select and download the model that fits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Model Name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Instruct model of Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, containing both thinker and talker, supporting audio, video, and text input, with audio and text output. For more information, please read the Qwen3-Omni Technical Report.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Thinking model of Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B, containing the thinker component, equipped with chain-of-thought reasoning, supporting audio, video, and text input, with text output. For more information, please read the Qwen3-Omni Technical Report.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A downstream audio fine-grained caption model fine-tuned from Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs. It contains the thinker, supporting audio input and text output. For more information, you can refer to the model's cookbook or Hugging Face Demo and ModelScope Demo.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During loading in Hugging Face Transformers or vLLM, model weights will be automatically downloaded based on the model name. However, if your runtime environment is not conducive to downloading weights during execution, you can refer to the following commands to manually download the model weights to a local directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Download through ModelScope (recommended for users in Mainland China)
pip install -U modelscope
modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --local_dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct
modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --local_dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking
modelscope download --model Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner --local_dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner

# Download through Hugging Face
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --local-dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --local-dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner --local-dir ./Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hugging Face Transformers code for Qwen3-Omni has been successfully merged, but the PyPI package has not yet been released. Therefore, you need to install it from source using the following command. We strongly recommend that you create a new Python environment or use our Docker to avoid environment runtime issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# If you already have transformers installed, please uninstall it first, or create a new Python environment
# pip uninstall transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
pip install accelerate&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer a toolkit to help you handle various types of audio and visual input more conveniently, providing an API-like experience. This includes support for base64, URLs, and interleaved audio, images, and videos. You can install it using the following command and make sure your system has &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; installed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install qwen-omni-utils -U&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we recommend using FlashAttention 2 when running with Hugging Face Transformers to reduce GPU memory usage. However, if you are primarily using vLLM for inference, this installation is not necessary, as vLLM includes FlashAttention 2 by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, you should have hardware that is compatible with FlashAttention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the FlashAttention repository. FlashAttention 2 can only be used when a model is loaded in &lt;code&gt;torch.float16&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;torch.bfloat16&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a code snippet to show you how to use Qwen3-Omni with &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;qwen_omni_utils&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

                   return_tensors="pt", 
                   padding=True, 
                   use_audio_in_video=USE_AUDIO_IN_VIDEO)
inputs = inputs.to(model.device).to(model.dtype)

# Batch inference does not support returning audio

                                 return_audio=False,
                                 thinker_return_dict_in_generate=True,

                              clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)
print(text)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Use audio output or not&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model supports both text and audio outputs. If users do not need audio outputs, they can call &lt;code&gt;model.disable_talker()&lt;/code&gt; after initializing the model. This option will save about &lt;code&gt;10GB&lt;/code&gt; of GPU memory, but the &lt;code&gt;return_audio&lt;/code&gt; option for the &lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; function will only allow &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;model = Qwen3OmniMoeForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(

    dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
model.disable_talker()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a more flexible experience, we recommend that users decide whether to return audio when the &lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; function is called. If &lt;code&gt;return_audio&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, the model will only return text outputs, resulting in faster text responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;model = Qwen3OmniMoeForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct",
    dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
...
text_ids, _ = model.generate(..., return_audio=False)```

&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;Change voice type of output audio&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;

Qwen3-Omni supports changing the voice of the output audio. The `"Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct"` checkpoint supports three voice types as follows:

| Voice Type | Gender | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Ethan      | Male   | A bright, upbeat voice with infectious energy and a warm, approachable vibe. |
| Chelsie    | Female | A honeyed, velvety voice that carries a gentle warmth and luminous clarity. |
| Aiden      | Male   | A warm, laid-back American voice with a gentle, boyish charm. |

Users can use the `speaker` parameter of the `generate` function to specify the voice type. By default, if `speaker` is not specified, the voice type is `Ethan`.

```python
text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., speaker="Ethan")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., speaker="Chelsie")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., speaker="Aiden")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, for more usage details such as prompt settings, task-specific usage methods, and resource requirements, please refer to Usage Tips and Cookbooks for Usage Cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We strongly recommend using vLLM for inference and deployment of the Qwen3-Omni series models. Since our code is currently in the pull request stage, and audio output inference support for the Instruct model will be released in the near future, you can follow the commands below to install vLLM from source. Please note that we recommend you create a new Python environment or use our provided Docker to avoid runtime environment conflicts and incompatibilities. For more details on compiling vLLM from source, please refer to the vLLM official documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone -b qwen3_omni https://github.com/wangxiongts/vllm.git
cd vllm
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -r requirements/cuda.txt
export VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_LOCATION=https://wheels.vllm.ai/a5dd03c1ebc5e4f56f3c9d3dc0436e9c582c978f/vllm-0.9.2-cp38-abi3-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 pip install -e . -v --no-build-isolation
# If you meet an "Undefined symbol" error while using VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1, please use "pip install -e . -v" to build from source.
# Install the Transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
pip install accelerate
pip install qwen-omni-utils -U
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use the following code for vLLM inference. The &lt;code&gt;limit_mm_per_prompt&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the maximum number of each modality's data allowed per message. Since vLLM needs to pre-allocate GPU memory, larger values will require more GPU memory; if OOM issues occur, try reducing this value. Setting &lt;code&gt;tensor_parallel_size&lt;/code&gt; greater than one enables multi-GPU parallel inference, improving concurrency and throughput. In addition, &lt;code&gt;max_num_seqs&lt;/code&gt; indicates the number of sequences that vLLM processes in parallel during each inference step. A larger value requires more GPU memory but enables higher batch inference speed. For more details, please refer to the vLLM official documentation. Below is a simple example of how to run Qwen3-Omni with vLLM:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;vLLM Serve Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vLLM serve for Qwen3-Omni currently only supports the thinker model. The &lt;code&gt;use_audio_in_video&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not available in vLLM serve; you can handle this by separately passing video and audio inputs for processing. You can start vLLM serve through the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct for single GPU
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --port 8901 --host 127.0.0.1 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 32768 --allowed-local-media-path / -tp 1
# Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct for multi-GPU (example on 4 GPUs)
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --port 8901 --host 127.0.0.1 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 65536 --allowed-local-media-path / -tp 4
# Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking for single GPU
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --port 8901 --host 127.0.0.1 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 32768 --allowed-local-media-path / -tp 1
# Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking for multi-GPU (example on 4 GPUs)
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --port 8901 --host 127.0.0.1 --dtype bfloat16 --max-model-len 65536 --allowed-local-media-path / -tp 4&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you can use the chat API as below (via curl, for example):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:8901/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{

    &lt;p&gt;Note: The table above presents the theoretical minimum memory requirements for inference with &lt;code&gt;transformers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BF16&lt;/code&gt; precision, tested with &lt;code&gt;attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"&lt;/code&gt;. The Instruct model includes both the thinker and talker components, whereas the Thinking model includes only the thinker part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using Qwen3-Omni for audio-visual multimodal interaction, where the input consists of a video and its corresponding audio (with the audio serving as a query), we recommend using the following system prompt. This setup helps the model maintain high reasoning capability while better assuming interactive roles such as a smart assistant. Additionally, the text generated by the thinker will be more readable, with a natural, conversational tone and without complex formatting that is difficult to vocalize, leading to more stable and fluent audio output from the talker. You can customize the &lt;code&gt;user_system_prompt&lt;/code&gt; field in the system prompt to include character settings or other role-specific descriptions as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user_system_prompt = "You are Qwen-Omni, a smart voice assistant created by Alibaba Qwen."

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking&lt;/code&gt; model is primarily designed for understanding and interacting with multimodal inputs, including text, audio, image, and video. To achieve optimal performance, we recommend that users include an explicit textual instruction or task description in each round of dialogue alongside the multimodal input. This helps clarify the intent and significantly enhances the model's ability to leverage its reasoning capabilities. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "audio", "audio": "/path/to/audio.wav"},
            {"type": "image", "image": "/path/to/image.png"},
            {"type": "video", "video": "/path/to/video.mp4"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze this audio, image, and video together."},
        ], 
    }
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In multimodal interaction, user-provided videos are often accompanied by audio (such as spoken questions or sounds from events in the video). This information helps the model provide a better interactive experience. We provide the following options for users to decide whether to use the audio from a video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# In data preprocessing
audios, images, videos = process_mm_info(messages, use_audio_in_video=True)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Transformers
text = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
inputs = processor(text=text, audio=audios, images=images, videos=videos, return_tensors="pt", 
                   padding=True, use_audio_in_video=True)
text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., use_audio_in_video=True)

# For vLLM
text = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
inputs = {
    'prompt': text,
    'multi_modal_data': {},
    "mm_processor_kwargs": {
        "use_audio_in_video": True,
    },
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that during a multi-round conversation, the &lt;code&gt;use_audio_in_video&lt;/code&gt; parameter must be set consistently across these steps; otherwise, unexpected results may occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without local deployment, you can experience an online web demo directly by visiting our Hugging Face Spaces and ModelScope Studio. This includes quick hands-on experiences for Qwen3-Omni-Realtime, Qwen3-Omni (Instruct and Thinking), and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real-time streaming interaction with Qwen3-Omni is available now. Please visit Qwen Chat and select the voice/video call option in the chat box to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, we provide instructions for users to build a web-based user interface (UI) demo. This UI demo allows users to interact with the model through a web browser. Follow the steps below to get start :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you begin, we strongly recommend that you refer to the Installation section in vLLM Usage to set up your environment, which will allow you to seamlessly use both the vLLM and Transformers backends. However, if you only intend to use the Transformers backend (note that this will result in significantly slower inference), please follow the installation instructions in Transformers Usage. That said, we still highly recommend using our Docker image to avoid potential environment-related issues. Additionally, if you are running locally, make sure your system has &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt; installed and you install the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install gradio==5.44.1 gradio_client==1.12.1 soundfile==0.13.1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the required packages are installed, you can launch the web demo using the following commands. These commands will start a web server and provide you with a link to access the UI in your web browser. You can run &lt;code&gt;python web_demo.py --help&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;python web_demo_captioner.py --help&lt;/code&gt; to learn about more options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct with vLLM backend
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct
# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct with Transformers backend

python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --use-transformers --generate-audio --flash-attn2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking with vLLM backend
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking

python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking --use-transformers --flash-attn2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner with vLLM backend
python web_demo_captioner.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner
# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner with Transformers backend
python web_demo_captioner.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner --use-transformers
# For Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner with Transformers backend and FlashAttention support
python web_demo_captioner.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner --use-transformers --flash-attn2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After running the command, you’ll see a link generated in the terminal similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Running on local: http://127.0.0.1:8901/
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are running locally, copy this link and paste it into your browser to access the web UI. If you are running on a server or in a &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; container, please configure the address according to the server's actual IP, or set up port forwarding where necessary. For instructions on how to configure port forwarding from the official &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; container to the host machine, please refer to here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To simplify the deployment process, we provide Docker images with pre-built environments: qwenllm/qwen3-omni. You only need to install the driver and download model files to launch the demos. Please refer to the guide to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, ensuring that your Docker can access the GPU. For users in mainland China who may have difficulty accessing Docker Hub, you can use mirror acceleration services to pull the images. First, run the following command to pull and initialize the container:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LOCAL_WORKDIR=/path/to/your/workspace
HOST_PORT=8901
CONTAINER_PORT=80
docker run --gpus all --name qwen3-omni \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p $HOST_PORT:$CONTAINER_PORT \
    --mount type=bind,source=$LOCAL_WORKDIR,target=/data/shared/Qwen3-Omni \
    --shm-size=4gb \
    -it qwenllm/qwen3-omni:3-cu124&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After executing the command, you will enter the bash shell of the container. Your local model and data directory (please replace &lt;code&gt;/path/to/your/workspace&lt;/code&gt; with the actual path) will be mounted to the container's internal path &lt;code&gt;/data/shared/Qwen3-Omni&lt;/code&gt;. The host's port &lt;code&gt;8901&lt;/code&gt; is mapped to port &lt;code&gt;80&lt;/code&gt; in the container, meaning you can access the service inside the container by visiting port &lt;code&gt;8901&lt;/code&gt; on the host machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that services inside the container must be started with the IP &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; to ensure proper port forwarding. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Run this command inside the Docker container
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --server-port 80 --server-name 0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more ways to launch the web demo, please refer to Launch Local Web UI Demo. If you exit the container, you can re-enter it using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker start qwen3-omni
docker exec -it qwen3-omni bash&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or if you want to completely remove the container, please run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker rm -f qwen3-omni&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qwen3-Omni maintains state-of-the-art performance on text and visual modalities without degradation relative to same-size single-model Qwen counterparts. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, it achieves open-source SOTA on 32 and sets the SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source systems such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Decoding Strategy: For the Qwen3-Omni series across all evaluation benchmarks, &lt;code&gt;Instruct&lt;/code&gt;models use greedy decoding during generation without sampling. For&lt;code&gt;Thinking&lt;/code&gt;models, the decoding parameters should be taken from the&lt;code&gt;generation_config.json&lt;/code&gt;file in the checkpoint.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Benchmark-Specific Formatting: For the majority of evaluation benchmarks, they come with their own ChatML formatting to embed the question or prompt. It should be noted that all video data are set to &lt;code&gt;fps=2&lt;/code&gt;during evaluation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default Prompts: For tasks in certain benchmarks that do not include a prompt, we use the following prompt settings:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;row span="2"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Listen to the provided &amp;lt;source_language&amp;gt; speech and produce a translation in &amp;lt;target_language&amp;gt; text.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Song Lyrics Recognition&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Transcribe the song lyrics into text without any punctuation, separate lines with line breaks, and output only the lyrics without additional explanations.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System Prompt: No &lt;code&gt;system prompt&lt;/code&gt;should be set for any evaluation benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input Sequence: The question or prompt should be input as user text. Unless otherwise specified by the benchmark, the text should come after multimodal data in the sequence. For example:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;messages = [

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I faced a dilemma that many researchers, journalists, and content creators know all too well: I had hours of recordings that needed to be transcribed. I had serious privacy concerns about uploading sensitive content to commercial transcription services and their third-party servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of risking it, I built a Python-based transcription system using OpenAI’s Whisper model. The result? All my audio files were transcribed in under 10 minutes with 96% accuracy—completely free and processed locally on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I will show you how you can build a simple script for processing any audio data without recurring costs or privacy compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Essential Setup Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. FFmpeg Installation (Critical First Step)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FFmpeg handles audio processing and is required for all transcription methods. This is the #1 cause of setup failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;⚠️ Setup Priority&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download from ffmpeg.org/download.html&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract to &lt;code&gt;C:\ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;C:\ffmpeg\bin&lt;/code&gt;to your PATH environment variable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restart your terminal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verify Installation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg -version&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should see version information. If you get “command not found,” FFmpeg isn’t properly installed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Python Environment Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;🔧 Virtual Environment Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Create isolated environment
python -m venv whisper-env
cd whisper-env

# Activate environment
# Windows:
Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install openai-whisper&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Method 1: OpenAI Whisper (Recommended)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whisper is OpenAI’s state-of-the-art speech recognition model, trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual audio. It’s specifically designed for robust, real-world audio transcription and handles various accents, background noise, and audio quality issues remarkably well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Local audio transcription with Python and Whisper offers a compelling alternative to commercial services. With a one-time setup, you get unlimited transcription capabilities, complete privacy, and often superior accuracy compared to cloud-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero ongoing costs after initial setup—no per-minute charges&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Complete privacy—audio never leaves your machine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High accuracy—94-98% depending on model choice and audio quality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fast processing—typically 4-16x real-time speed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Offline capability—works without internet connection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No usage limits—transcribe as much as you want&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a researcher transcribing interviews, a journalist working with sensitive sources, or a content creator processing podcasts, this local solution gives you the control and privacy that cloud services can’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup might take 30 minutes, but you’ll save hours of time and potentially hundreds of dollars in transcription costs. Plus, you’ll have the peace of mind that comes with keeping your audio data completely under your control.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fine-grained HTTP filtering for Claude Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents are becoming more powerful every day without commensurate security and governance tooling. The result is a world where solo developers happily run &lt;code&gt;claude --dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt; for hours unmoderated while many of the world's most important organizations have barely tried agentic developmentLearned from our experience at Coder . I've been working on a tool called &lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt; in an effort to make agents available everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool is focused on mitigating these classes of risks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Risk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Example&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Agents performing destructive actions&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Deleting your database&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Agents leaking sensitive information&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Exposing API keys or credentials&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Agents operating with more authority than desired&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Pushing straight to main instead of opening a PR&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents may transgress accidentally (user misinterpretation) or intentionally (prompt injection).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a class of risks at the file-system interface too, but, I believe existing tooling (containers) is sufficient here. Existing network isolation tools rely on IP-based rules. In our case, they're imprecisecentralized, anycast load balancers power much of the internet and require constant maintenanceIPs change randomly and they're not a part of a service's implicit "contract".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;httpjail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt; implements an HTTP(S) interceptor alongside process-level network isolation. Under default configuration, all DNS (udp:53) is permitted and
all other non-HTTP(S) traffic is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt; rules are either JavaScript expressions or custom programs. This approach makes
them far more flexible than traditional rule-oriented firewalls and avoids the learning curve of a DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Block all HTTP requests other than the LLM API traffic itself:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ httpjail --js "r.host === 'api.anthropic.com'" -- claude "build something great"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allow only &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests i.e. make the internet read-only:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ httpjail --js "r.method === 'GET'" -- claude "build something great"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only allow hosts in a &lt;code&gt;whitelist.txt&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ httpjail --sh "grep -qx \"$HTTPJAIL_HOST\" whitelist.txt" -- claude "research these APIs"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong| NS[Create namespace&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;+ nftables redirect&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;+ setuid $SUDO_USER] Start --&amp;gt;|macOS/--weak&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;via nftables| Proxy Route --&amp;gt;|Weak: respects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$HTTP_PROXY| Proxy Route --&amp;gt;|Weak: ignores&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$HTTP_PROXY| Bypass Rules --&amp;gt;|Allow| Internet Rules --&amp;gt;|Deny| Blocked style NS fill:#00d4ff,color:#0a0a0a style Env fill:#00d4ff,color:#0a0a0a style Proxy fill:#404040 style Blocked fill:#8b2635 style Internet fill:#2a7f62 style Bypass fill:#8b2635&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;macOS (Weak Mode)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS uses &lt;code&gt;--weak/-w&lt;/code&gt; mode by default (see #7).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In weak mode, we rely on process cooperation via the standard &lt;code&gt;HTTP_PROXY&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;HTTPS_PROXY&lt;/code&gt; environment variables. This mode is less of a jail and more of a suggestion that the majority of
well-meaning applications happen to comply with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TLS Interception&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt; implements full TLS interception to inspect and filter HTTPS traffic. Without interception, rules would only have access to the hostname via SNI, and most of the power of this tool would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How TLS Interception Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certificate Authority Generation: On first run,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt;generates a self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) that's stored in&lt;code&gt;~/.config/httpjail/&lt;/code&gt;. This CA is used to sign certificates for intercepted connections.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Certificate Generation: When a client connects,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extracts the Server Name Indication (SNI) from the TLS ClientHello&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Generates a certificate on-the-fly for that specific hostname &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Uses a shared ECDSA P-256 key pair for all server certificates for O(1) keygen overhead&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Signs it with the CA certificate&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Caches certificate in memory for performance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dual Mode Operation:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Transparent Proxy Mode: Directly accepts TLS connections by detecting the TLS ClientHello packet (starts with &lt;code&gt;0x16&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Explicit Proxy Mode: Handles HTTP CONNECT tunnels, responds with "200 Connection Established", then transitions to Transparent Proxy Mode&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transparent Proxy Mode: Directly accepts TLS connections by detecting the TLS ClientHello packet (starts with &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust Injection: The CA certificate must be trusted by client applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt;automatically sets environment variables for common tools:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SSL_CERT_FILE&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;SSL_CERT_DIR&lt;/code&gt;for OpenSSL-based tools&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CURL_CA_BUNDLE&lt;/code&gt;for curl&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS&lt;/code&gt;for Node.js&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE&lt;/code&gt;for Python requests&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;GIT_SSL_CAINFO&lt;/code&gt;for Git&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Jail Escapes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the weak jail, it's trivial for the agent to escape the jail by funnelling requests through a shim program that disregards the &lt;code&gt;HTTP_PROXY&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even the strong jail is not perfect. There are potential escape hatches in the filesystem. For example, the agent could create a container via a Docker socket which would spawn outside the network namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To combine filesystem and network isolation into one, &lt;code&gt;httpjail&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;--docker-run&lt;/code&gt; flag that works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;httpjail --js "r.host === 'api.github.com'" --docker-run -- \
    --rm alpine:latest wget -qO- https://api.github.com
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe there's still much value in this approach even with imperfect isolation. In my experience, models seldom try to escape restrictions intentionally placed by the user. And, if the jail is rendered ineffective by prompt injection, it wasn't doing its job in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Server Mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the strongest level of isolation, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;httpjail --server&lt;/code&gt;on a standalone server.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure the network firewall to only permit 80/443 traffic to the proxy server. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optionally, you may redirect all traffic to the proxy server, otherwise you will need to take care in ensuring HTTP_PROXY is set in your environments and all of your web-faring applications respect it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run processes as usual in the development environment.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Request] Check{Respects&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Seeing the light&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Germicidal ultraviolet could make airborne diseases as rare as those carried by water.&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Between the 1860s and 1920, successive outbreaks of typhoid fever killed over 300,000 Americans. As population growth surged and people moved to urban areas en masse, American cities began to dump sewage in the same rivers that provided their drinking water. After epidemiologists linked typhoid outbreaks to water cleanliness, cities began building large-scale sand filtration systems in the 1890s, and in 1908, Jersey City pioneered the first continuous chlorination of a public water supply. By the 1920s, typhoid deaths had fallen by two-thirds, and waterborne diseases were in retreat across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While typhoid and other waterborne diseases triggered vast engineering and regulatory responses, the equivalent airborne threats have not. Tuberculosis alone kills more than a million people every year around the world, yet the air in schools, clinics, and public buildings remains largely unfiltered and unmonitored. Covid-19, which killed over seven million people, demonstrated how rapidly airborne pathogens can spread in poorly ventilated spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as filtration and chlorination made drinking water safe at scale, we now have the tools to do the same for indoor air: ventilation, high-quality filters, and germicidal light. A century ago, germicidal light at 254 nanometers seemed to be a promising way of controlling pathogens by killing them in the air, but it turned out to cause irritation and cancer in the skin, and it was largely dropped when antibiotics became widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But today there is an update that has none of these drawbacks. We now know that wavelengths under 230 nanometers, especially 222 nanometer light, are harmless to humans, but can still disable microscopic pathogens. We know how to filter out all wavelengths except the ones we want, and how to direct them away from humans, cycling the air through them to clean it without exposing people to it, just in case it carries unknown risks. This far-UVC light, as it is called, may be how we can make the air we breathe as safe as the water we drink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The sterilamp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until the mid-nineteenth century, most physicians believed that disease spread through miasmas, poisonous vapors rising from filth and decay. Contemporaries were obsessed with air: moving to the countryside for the air, taking the air at the seaside. Bad air was blamed for sickness. Herbs were burned to purify the air to fight the plague. But because they didn’t understand what made the air dirty, they were not very good at cleaning it. This began to change only when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch provided the first definitive proof that microscopic organisms were responsible for infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cleaning air relies on the same fundamental techniques as cleaning water: replacement, filtration, and disinfection. Pathogens replicate inside people, who then expel them into the air by breathing, talking, or coughing, where they can remain suspended and infect new individuals. The relative contributions of aerosol transmission, droplet transmission, and fomite (surface) transmission vary between diseases. Certain diseases, such as Covid-19, are driven by a small number of highly infectious individuals (‘superspreaders’) that account for a disproportionate number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1877, British researchers Arthur Downes and Thomas Blunt stumbled upon a discovery that would lay the groundwork for modern disinfection. In a paper submitted to the Royal Society of London, they described how over the course of six months they had used sunlight to prevent bacteria from growing in a tube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow-up research by Robert Koch demonstrated that sunlight could kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the early experiments lacked precision. Scientists knew light worked, but not which parts of the spectrum were responsible. The turning point came in 1930, when Frederick L Gates published the first quantitative analysis of how ultraviolet light affected bacteria, pinpointing peak germicidal effectiveness at 265 nanometers, the same point that nucleic acids – DNA and RNA – absorb light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the spectrum wasn’t necessary for harnessing it. In 1901, American electrical engineer Peter Cooper Hewitt patented the first mercury-vapor lamp to achieve widespread commercial success. Hewitt created a voltage difference across electrodes in a glass tube, with mercury vapor causing electrons to separate from mercury atoms and collide with other atoms, exciting them to higher energy states. When these excited atoms return to their ground state, they release energy as photons, primarily at a wavelength of 254 nanometers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nucleic acids absorb this 254-nanometer light and produce new bonds between bases, preventing DNA/RNA replication. For human skin and eyes, this means sunburn-like irritation. But for viruses, amoeba, and bacteria in the air, as engineers at an American manufacturing company put it, these rays spell doom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An array of different factors influences how sensitive pathogens are to ultraviolet-C (UVC), ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 100–280 nanometers. Viruses with larger genomes – such as herpesviruses (which have about 150,000 base pairs) or coronaviruses (30,000 base pairs) – offer many nucleotide bonds for photons to break, so they can be more quickly disabled than small-genome viruses such as parvoviruses (5,000 base pairs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1936, Dr. Deryl Hart, a surgeon at Duke University Hospital, became the first person to use ultraviolet radiation to curb airborne infections in surgical operating rooms. High-intensity germicidal ultraviolet light fixtures, designed to irradiate the entire room, cut postoperative wound infection rates from 11.6 percent to just 0.2 percent, and not one patient out of 2,463 cases died from postoperative infections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly after the installation at Duke, UV from mercury vapor lamps was used to create invisible ‘curtains’ between cubicles in hospital wards and cribs in nurseries in Philadelphia, Boston, Toronto, and Evanston. In Boston, this attempt to prevent respiratory pathogens from crossing cubicles and infecting infant patients led to infection rates that were a quarter of those in the other cubicles. In the other cases, cross-infections fell by between 40 percent and 96 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1937, researchers installed upper-room germicidal UV lights in the Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia and studied its impact over the next few school years. During the fourth year of the study, Philadelphia saw its largest recorded epidemic of measles, the most transmissible known pathogen. In the irradiated classrooms, only 14.5 percent of susceptible children fell ill, while in the unprotected ones, infection rates soared to 55 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the height of World War II, US defence manufacturer Westinghouse wrote that it was ‘fighting two wars at once’: one against the Germans and Japanese and the other against germs. Once a major producer of UV lamps and fixtures, the company had developed the Sterilamp in the 1930s. The Sterilamp system is described in a 1943 newsletter as a ‘DEATH RAY THAT GUARDS LIFE’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the deployment of germicidal UV light stalled after the war. In 1945–46, the New York Department of Health tried to replicate the Philadelphia findings in large public rural schools and failed. In one of the schools with an internal control group in Port Byron, 90.4 percent of susceptible students in UV-treated classrooms still contracted measles, compared to 83 percent in unirradiated classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once they took bus ridership into account, the researchers found that UV had appeared to reduce the measles incidence rate by roughly 8.2 percentage points (from 77.4 percent to 69.2 percent) in non-bus riders. Germicidal UV could disrupt measles transmission in specific spaces such as classrooms, but it proved insufficient if face-to-face exposure continued in buses, hallways, and other shared spaces. Mercury lamps were also costly and could irritate the skin and eyes of people exposed to them. No long-term effects had been observed in humans at the doses used in schools, but higher doses had been shown to raise long-term cancer risk in mice. At the same time, the large-scale emergence of antibiotics was transforming the fight against infectious diseases. By 1945, mass production made penicillin widely available, ushering in the antibiotic era and shifting the medical focus toward drug-based infection control. Together with the failures of the UV studies, interest in germicidal UV receded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Returning from obsolescence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decades later, over 700,000 people a year die from antibiotic resistance as people use more and more antibiotics while their discovery rates stagnate. Airborne viral pandemics, which antibiotics cannot treat, have caused enormous economic damage and inflicted tens of millions of deaths. There is once again a case for the use of germicidal ultraviolet light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skin and eye irritation and cancer risks limited direct exposure to 254-nanometer germicidal UV to surgical cases. But new technologies – circulation, light filtering, and lower wavelengths – have together fixed these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can circulate air, we can move it, clean it, and put it back. Today’s systems do this by projecting beams across the upper level of a room, above the heads of occupants. Natural circulation patterns move air to the ceiling, where it is cleaned, before it falls back down. But even reflected beams can cause irritation, meaning that each installation has to be calibrated carefully for the specifics of the room. Even repainting or shifting furniture can change the reflection of the beams, meaning that the UV beams would need to be recalibrated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shorter-wavelength light works just as effectively, without many of the downsides. Light with a wavelength of 230 nanometers or lower, known as ‘far-UVC’, disables pathogens without hurting humans, but mercury lamps cannot produce it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike longer wavelengths, far-UVC penetrates weakly, meaning it is only absorbed by the uppermost layers of the skin and eye, tissues which slough off frequently and do not divide. When shone directly into the eyes, germicidal doses of far-UVC do not appear to have any effect beyond temporary discomfort (the same as if a torch was shone into your eyes). When installed overhead, the lamp’s positioning and human facial structure mean only five percent of the light reaches the eye, creating an even larger safety margin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure does not harm mice at all, even those with a severely limited ability to repair DNA defects. In humans, a 36-month-long trial installation of far-UVC in a hospital, with ongoing exposure to germicidal doses, caused no adverse effects on those working on the ward. There is no evidence from any other study that far-UVC raises cancer rates, though more work should be done to prove this beyond any doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to prevent disease transmission, far-UVC lamps must disable pathogens in respiratory aerosols quickly enough that, by the time they are inhaled, not enough for an infectious dose remain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2024 study presented some of the best data on far-UVC in an occupied room. Four lamps were installed in a lab mouse cage-cleaning room, where the constant activity and movement continuously aerosolized murine norovirus present in the bedding. When switched on, the lamps reduced the amount of virus in the air by 98 percent, equivalent to at least 36 air changes per hour. This happened despite murine norovirus being more resistant to far-UVC than many common human respiratory viruses, likely due to its tough protein outer ‘shell’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Alternatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other ways to clean the air, like ventilation and filtration. There’s an important role for both of these approaches, but they come with critical limitations that only far-UVC can plausibly overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ventilation is the easiest method of removing things from indoor air, diluting pathogens and pollutants into the 5.5 quadrillion tonnes of atmosphere outside. But it is not always convenient. It can be awkward or noisy to install and run. In highly polluted areas, bringing in outdoor air reduces disease transmission at the expense of worse air quality. In 2024, only seven countries met World Health Organization air quality standards. In very hot or cold places, outdoor air must be heated or cooled, which can be energy-intensive and costly, especially in older or heritage buildings where air conditioning needs to be retrofitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another technique is filtration. Mechanical filters work by forcing air through a dense, pleated mesh of fine fibers that trap hazardous particles. Originally developed as part of the Manhattan Project to prevent the spread of radioactive particles, mechanical filters have become standard in hospitals, cleanrooms, and aircraft cabins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mechanical filters are ‘plug and play’: there are dozens of verified and recommended models that anyone can buy off the shelf, install in their house by plugging them in, and expect to deliver reduced pollutants, allergens, and cleaner air for between $80 and $300. Consumer far-UVC systems are often considerably more expensive – a typical example costs $2,500 for a lamp covering 1,000 square feet, although a newer model has recently come to market at $600, and less expensive lamps with lower output can be added together to cover a similar floorspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drawbacks of ventilation-based air filtration methods are similar to the drawbacks of ventilation itself. Moving air from place to place and forcing it through a fine filter requires energy, and fresh air from outdoors is often at the wrong temperature, requiring extra heating or cooling. Meanwhile, the constant air movement can also chill the air to the point of discomfort, requiring indoor heating. This has obvious impacts on the costs and environmental footprint of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doubling the ventilation rate from the US standard minimum in offices could add up to $40 per person per year to building running costs. This is lower than typically predicted, but still more than double what many building officials were prepared (before the pandemic) to pay. Energy recovery units help equalize the temperatures between intake and exhaust air, and can lower these figures by about 60 percent (or even more), depending on local climate and system type. However, in Europe, the hurdle is even higher: most buildings have no mechanical ventilation at all, so adapting existing ventilation systems is out of the question. For example, in the UK, an engineering review found that only five percent of residential buildings were likely to have air conditioning (a proxy for mechanical ventilation) by 2019. By contrast, in the US, about 90 percent of residences have air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ventilation comes with another tradeoff: noise. The more air you filter, the harder your fan has to work, the faster it spins, and the louder it gets. Free-standing filtration units can be powerful, quiet, or affordable – but rarely all three at once. Purpose-built ventilation can be made quieter, but quiet movement of a large volume of air requires wide, leak-free ducting, which can increase installation complexity. Real world studies have shown that the noise and discomfort created by even relatively modest free-standing units mean that they are frequently turned down or switched off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These drawbacks mean that ventilation-based methods lack the power to effectively block transmission of highly infectious pathogens or prevent pandemics. Without UV light, public buildings will require air handling systems akin to those in hospital isolation rooms to comply with current infection control guidelines. While circumstances vary from place to place, ventilation-based air quality measures quickly become impractical beyond around five air changes per hour, while upper-room UV light can achieve the equivalent of 35 air changes per hour, and far-UVC has the potential to reach well over 100.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this, both ventilation and filtration need to be kept in mind as new buildings replace the old. If nothing else, ventilation design is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of UV systems; how well air is mixed and how quickly it moves affects the degree to which pathogens are exposed to UV light. These interactions have a positive or negative effect on pathogen removal. We flush and filter water, but we also disinfect it to eliminate remaining microbes. Air should be treated no differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Far-UVC is like an aerial disinfectant or bleach, except that it is harmless to humans at practical germicidal doses, and thus should not provoke resistance to its uptake. It does not alter pathogens in a way that allows resistance to emerge, a serious problem for antibiotics. Instead, it thoroughly damages microbial genomes at random, destroying bacteria and viruses alike, whether they are drug-resistant, vaccine-evasive, or indeed newly emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most widely used commercial far-UVC source is a krypton-chloride excimer lamp. ‘Excimer’ is a contraction of ‘excited dimer’, a short-lived, high-energy molecule formed when the krypton and chlorine temporarily bond in an excited state as an electric current is passed through the gas mixture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Krypton chloride lamps emit mostly 222-nanometer light, produced by the excited dimer decaying to its ground state and releasing the excess energy as a photon. Light at this wavelength is safe for human eyes and skin at doses that efficiently kill germs, but about 10–20 percent of the output consists of longer wavelengths with much lower maximum exposures. To use the lamps in occupied spaces, a filter with multiple layers of quartz and hafnium oxide is used to reflect unwanted wavelengths while allowing 222-nanometer light through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite its potential, far-UVC has yet to achieve widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very best krypton chloride emitters on the market are reliable, long-lasting, powerful, use little energy, and come with effective optical filters. But the state of the art is not representative. The krypton-chloride lamp industry is plagued by low-quality products with short lifespans that may not even produce any far-UVC light, and could even emit dangerous longer wavelengths. There is no product standard certification for UV lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Top-tier excimer lamps, from reputable manufacturers, are expensive. This is partly due to their inherent complexity but largely from sluggish demand. The key reason is that, notwithstanding their successes in the 1930s, a certification vacuum denies buyers an authoritative seal of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In part, this is because some of the studies establishing far-UVC’s efficacy aren’t as definitive as they need to be to really move the dial. One study on the impact of germicidal UV installations on tuberculosis transmission in homeless shelters was unsuccessful when the national rate of tuberculosis declined, which meant that the study ended up being too small to detect an effect even in principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another study, germicidal UV was installed in hospitals to assess the impact of germicidal UV on flu transmission, but during the course of that study, the hospitals stopped routine flu testing. In a classroom study, not all classrooms had enough electrical sockets to plug in the portable air cleaners required for the study, some teachers turned off the air filters because they were too loud, and some schools didn’t install the germicidal UV devices they were supposed to because there were no legal protections for them for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are many other factors as well. Measuring infection control is challenging and seldom undertaken, particularly in public spaces. Epidemiological data is expensive and difficult to gather, and there is currently no way to measure the amount of viable, infectious pathogens in the air in real time. Office attendance can be tracked, but controlling for how users mix outside the office space is immensely difficult, and measuring the real-world effect of small-scale deployments in public areas is almost impossible. Studies aiming to cause deliberate disease transmission in controlled environments have failed to work in practice because they have been too small to generate enough infections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pathogen-free air and the research that goes into getting it are both, to some extent, public goods: the beneficiaries will mostly be people who haven’t paid for them. Even if a business reduces pathogens in its offices’ air, the biggest upside goes to other people who share spaces with its employees. This could be commuters on the same train, people in shops, or parents whose children attend the same school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of clear economic upside, we are already seeing some early adoption among respected institutions: Mount Sinai Hospital, for example, has far-UVC lamps installed in its Cohen Center for Recovery from Complex Chronic Illnesses. Ideally, others would emulate this example, creating a stronger basis for research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If one part of the knot were cut, then one of the most promising disease-fighting technologies of our time could finally be employed en masse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early 1900s, a public health official in Jersey City, John Leal, lost his father to illness likely caused by contaminated drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Leal had an opportunity to prevent such a loss for others: he quietly directed the addition of chlorine to the drinking water supply in Jersey City, hiring engineer George Fuller to design and build a system for dripping a diluted bleach solution into Boonton Reservoir. He believed that this common household bleach agent could kill pathogens without harming people. He was right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond being a triumph of science, water sanitation led to a fundamental shift in public expectations. Once people saw that clean water was possible, they demanded it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century water treatment programs transformed public health by virtually eliminating waterborne diseases. Ventilation, filtration and disinfection provide us with the opportunity to dramatically reduce the burden of airborne illnesses. Tuberculosis and coronaviruses would join typhoid and cholera as tragedies of the past, and seasonal flu and common colds would become rare rather than routine if clean air were as universal and expected as clean water.&lt;/p&gt;

Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.AI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;Fall is nearly upon us, and we're once again helping fall foliage enthusiasts across the country find the best fall color! Use our map to explore the estimated timing of fall foliage throughout the United States, allowing you to plan trips with confidence this year. Check back regularly for updates based on the latest reports gathered from hundreds of sources throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two primary factors control the timing of fall foliage: daylight and temperature. This means that the further north and the higher in elevation a tree is, the earlier it will reveal it's colorful canopy. Photosynthesis grinds to a halt when the days grow short in the fall, and leaves no longer have a need for their excess stores of chlorophyll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of a month or two, the concentrations of chlorophyll diminish, allowing less concentrated chemicals such as anthocyanin and carotenoids to dominate, turning the leaf red, yellow, or orange. The rate at which this change occurs varies amongst tree species, so it can be difficult to pinpoint a single peak in fall foliage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when the vast majority of trees in a particular area have full canopies of autumnal color, peak has arrived. Some areas, partiularly in the Northeast, experience vibrant red peaks due to an abundance of maple trees, while others experience a mixture of all of fall's colors. Different trees display different colors, giving each region its own unique peak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of the United States, peak fall color arrives in the month of October. This is when wide swaths of the Northeast, Midwest, and Western states are aglow with bright fall foliage, and more than 80% of travelers make their fall foliage trips. Some less-populated regions will peak in September (August in northern Alaska), while the southernmost states hold off until mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most popular fall foliage displays are found in New England, where approximately ten million people travel each year in hopes of photographing or simply walking through fall's splendor. Northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and northwestern Maine experience peak in early October, while much of New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania have to wait until later in the month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out west, golden Aspens peak in sweeping displays in late September and early October, just prior to the invasive chill of winter. Non-desert, lower elevations in the Northwest are further delayed into late October/early November; however, the wait is well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've ever traveled in search of fall foliage before, you likely know how tricky it can be to be in the right place at the right time. The timing of peak color varies signficantly season-to-season, meaning what worked one year might not work the next! The best fall trips take careful planning, a lot of patience, and a reliable fall foliage map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's helpful to establish a baseline for when leaves normally change. Maps, like the one in the above section, can help you identify roughly when in the season you should be planning your trip. From there, you should consult a real-time fall foliage map like ours to see if fall foliage is on-time or running early/late due to ongoing weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If at all possible, don't solidify your plans until you're two weeks out from peak fall foliage. This allows you to be flexible should extreme weather rear its head and disrupt the normal progression of fall foliage. Should that not be an option for you, do your planning in early September when fall foliage experts can give you an idea of whether or not fall color is on-time this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll want to make the most of your time in fall's splendor, so be sure to pick out a few beautiful hikes or drives on which you can truly be emersed in autumnal glory. If you're looking to beat the crowds, consider going to popular locations very early in the morning, before the majority of people arrive. Sunrise bathes fall foliage in golden hues, making early morning one of the best times to venture out!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Major Trading Firm Has Open-Sourced The Latest Linux File-System: TernFS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; XTX Markets as one of the largest algorithmic trading firms that handles $250 billion in daily traded volume and relies on around 650+ petabytes of storage for its price forecasts and other algorithmic trading data has open-sourced its Linux file-system. XTX developed TernFS for distributed storage after they outgrew their original NFS usage and other file-system alternatives. &lt;lb/&gt;TernFS is a distributed file-system for dealing with reading and writing large immutable files -- immutable in the context that they are typically not modified after being created. And large in the context of being at least a few megabytes. TernFS is designed for XTX data center needs of maxing out at around 10EB of logical file storage, around one trillion files and 100 billion directories with around one million clients. All running atop commodity hardware and Ethernet networking.&lt;lb/&gt;TernFS is also able to span across multiple geographic regions, store data redundantly to protect against drive failures, no single point of failure for metadata, and other features for the demanding needs of XTX Markets.&lt;lb/&gt;TernFS has been in development for over three years and for over the past year is being used by all of the XTX machine learning efforts. XTX Markets reports that "to this day, we haven't lost a single byte" on TernFS.&lt;lb/&gt;Those wishing to learn more about this Linux-native TernFS file-system that is now open-source can do so via the XTX Markets blog. TernFS is available under GPLv2+ and Apache 2.0 licenses. The TernFS file-system is open-source on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A game book is, contrary to the usual books, a book you don't read pages sequentially. These books are read interactively. You are offered a choice after a paragraph: go to the right turn to section 7, go to the left turn to 138. That's it. Depending on the series, you might have additional rules: fight, magic, psi power, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the winter holidays, I thought a bit more about these books. They could be encoded as directed graph networks. Therefore I could probably apply a bunch of network algorithms to them to extract interesting information such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the shortest path to an instant death,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the path with the most fights,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;etc.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose for my analysis the Lone Wolf series because, luckily for me, some people have put all the books in an electronic format and it's legal. It's a story about Lone Wolf (unexpected I know) the last of his kind, a caste of warrior monks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NB: The Dawn of the Darklords was excluded from the analysis as it was not officially released as a gamebook. It was included in the Magnamund companion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Masters of Darkness has the most action packed with a possible solution path including 65 fights;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The shortest path to death is The Kingdoms of Terror with only a 5 section path;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Caverns of Kalte is the most deadly adventure with 19 instant death sections;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The shortest adventure is Flight from the Dark with a solution path only 27 sections long;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The longest adventure which can be done is The Shadow on the Sand with a touristic path of 224 sections, more than half of the sections (400).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a summary for the 28 books I've analyzed. For now Lonewolf comprises 4 series:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kai series: 1 to 5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Magnakai series: 6 to 12&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grand Master series: 13 to 20&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New Order series: 21 to 32 (but now only 28 in project aon)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The values reported below are the average value for each category. Something interesting we can see if that from the 3rd series, there are no more cycles and the shortest path has increased on average 50% compared to the 1st and 2nd series. Also, the shortest path to death has tripled and the number of insta-death was halved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the books might have become more focused on adventure and story but also less punishing. Having only read the first couple of books, I can't comment on this but if somebody has an opinion on this, I would be happy to hear about it and maybe update the post with your comments.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;156&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The technical bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The preparation: Turn to 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Turn to" are the mythic words in these game books. It's also how we will divide the different sections of text, by using regexp. There are 5 types of section and their assigned color:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;normal: you can move forward to another section (white),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;luck: you are asked to test your luck and you can move forward to another section (green),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fight: you are asked to fight some monster(s) and you can move forward to another section (yellow),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;death: you chose badly and you got yourself killed, you have to restart from the section 1 (red),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;start/end: first section and last section (blue).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the sections are defined, we have to create the directed graph. To do so, I used two python libraries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extracting the interesting information: Test your Luck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mainly used &lt;code&gt;networkx&lt;/code&gt; for the graph network analysis. It's a straightforward library and the documentation is good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Do you need a DAGger?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically a Lonewolf adventure is the equivalent of a Directed (A)Cyclic Graph:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Directed: Lonewolf, your character, goes from the section 1 to hopefully the latest section which is depending on the book the section 300, 350 or 400, without the possibility to come back to the previous section;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Acyclic: This is not totally true for the Lonewolf series as 7 books contain cycles, a "circular" path between two nodes which a node is repeated twice. Some algorithms like the shortest path or longest path require a DAG and we need to remove the cycles before running them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Graph: The sections are the nodes of the graph and the vertices the choices for each section.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Disconnected graphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In several books, graphs are disconnected. It means you can't go from the section 1 to the end section (300 or 350). This indicates usually that there is an enigma or puzzle asking to add numbers discovered along the adventure and reach the section given by the number. The only way to process these graphs is to check the text notes and add the missing edges manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cycle removal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cycle removal is an interesting problem as it is one of the first problem to have been shown as NP-complete (NP stands for Non deterministic Polynomial time). This means that there is no known way to find a solution to solve that problem quickly and the time to find a solution grows as the size of the input grows. Nonetheless we are lucky because the data from a gamebook is usually quite small (300 to 400 nodes and 400 to 600 edges)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea behind the cycle removal is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;do a DFS search,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;look at the nodes and their children,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if one or more children have been already visited, remove that edge.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was curious about what could be done with a graph analysis of such textual / interactive games. Besides applying basic algorithms to test if the gamebook is playable, I didn't find much insights from it. I would like to see if there are any correlations between the features I chose and the popularity of the gamebooks. That being said, it was a cool project to do. I brushed up on the graph theory which I never really used outside of university.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apply the same methodology to Figthing Fantasy gamebooks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;zoxide is a smarter cd command, inspired by z and autojump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It remembers which directories you use most frequently, so you can "jump" to them in just a few keystrokes.&lt;lb/&gt; zoxide works on all major shells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting started • Installation • Configuration • Integrations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;z foo              # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo
z foo bar          # cd into highest ranked directory matching foo and bar
z foo /            # cd into a subdirectory starting with foo

z ~/foo            # z also works like a regular cd command
z foo/             # cd into relative path
z ..               # cd one level up
z -                # cd into previous directory

zi foo             # cd with interactive selection (using fzf)

z foo&amp;lt;SPACE&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;  # show interactive completions (zoxide v0.8.0+, bash 4.4+/fish/zsh only)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read more about the matching algorithm here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;zoxide can be installed in 4 easy steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install binary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;zoxide runs on most major platforms. If your platform isn't listed below, please open an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Linux / WSL&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended way to install zoxide is via the install script:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh | sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, you can use a package

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setup zoxide on your shell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start using zoxide, add it to your shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Bash&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file (usually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;eval "$(zoxide init bash)"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;Elvish&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file (usually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.elvish/rc.elv&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;eval (zoxide init elvish | slurp)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note zoxide only supports elvish v0.18.0 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Fish&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file (usually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.config/fish/config.fish&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;zoxide init fish | source&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;Nushell&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your env file (find it by running&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$nu.env-path&lt;/code&gt;in Nushell):&lt;quote&gt;zoxide init nushell | save -f ~/.zoxide.nu&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, add this to the end of your config file (find it by running&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$nu.config-path&lt;/code&gt;in Nushell):&lt;quote&gt;source ~/.zoxide.nu&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note zoxide only supports Nushell v0.89.0+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;PowerShell&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file (find it by running&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $profile&lt;/code&gt;in PowerShell):&lt;quote&gt;Invoke-Expression (&amp;amp; { (zoxide init powershell | Out-String) })&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;Tcsh&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file (usually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.tcshrc&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;zoxide init tcsh &amp;gt; ~/.zoxide.tcsh source ~/.zoxide.tcsh&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;Xonsh&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file (usually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.xonshrc&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;execx($(zoxide init xonsh), 'exec', __xonsh__.ctx, filename='zoxide')&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;Zsh&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file (usually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For completions to work, the above line must be added after&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;compinit&lt;/code&gt;is called. You may have to rebuild your completions cache by running&lt;code&gt;rm ~/.zcompdump*; compinit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;head&gt;Any POSIX shell&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this to the end of your config file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;eval "$(zoxide init posix --hook prompt)"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install fzf (optional)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;fzf is a command-line fuzzy finder, used by zoxide for completions / interactive selection. It can be installed from here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note The minimum supported fzf version is v0.51.0.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Import your data (optional)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you currently use any of these plugins, you may want to import your data into zoxide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;autojump&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run this command in your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zoxide import --from=autojump "/path/to/autojump/db"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path usually varies according to your system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;th&gt;OS&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Path&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Linux&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump/autojump.txt&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/home/alice/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;macOS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$HOME/Library/autojump/autojump.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/Users/Alice/Library/autojump/autojump.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Windows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\autojump\autojump.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\autojump\autojump.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;fasd, z, z.lua, zsh-z&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run this command in your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zoxide import --from=z "path/to/z/db"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path usually varies according to your system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;th&gt;Plugin&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Path&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;fasd&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$_FASD_DATA&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.fasd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;z (bash/zsh)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$_Z_DATA&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.z&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;z (fish)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$Z_DATA&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/z/data&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/share/z/data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;z.lua (bash/zsh)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$_ZL_DATA&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.zlua&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;z.lua (fish)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/zlua/zlua.txt&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/share/zlua/zlua.txt&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$_ZL_DATA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;zsh-z&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ZSHZ_DATA&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$_Z_DATA&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.z&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head&gt;ZLocation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run this command in PowerShell:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;$db = New-TemporaryFile (Get-ZLocation).GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { Write-Output ($_.Name+'|'+$_.Value+'|0') } | Out-File $db zoxide import --from=z $db&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When calling &lt;code&gt;zoxide init&lt;/code&gt;, the following flags are available:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;--cmd&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Changes the prefix of the &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;zi&lt;/code&gt;commands.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--cmd j&lt;/code&gt;would change the commands to (&lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ji&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--cmd cd&lt;/code&gt;would replace the&lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;command.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Changes the prefix of the &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;--hook &amp;lt;HOOK&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes how often zoxide increments a directory's score:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;th&gt;Hook&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Never&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;prompt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;At every shell prompt&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt;(default)&lt;td&gt;Whenever the directory is changed&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;--no-cmd&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Prevents zoxide from defining the &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;zi&lt;/code&gt;commands.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;These functions will still be available in your shell as &lt;code&gt;__zoxide_z&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;__zoxide_zi&lt;/code&gt;, should you choose to redefine them.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prevents zoxide from defining the &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Environment variables2 can be used for configuration. They must be set before &lt;code&gt;zoxide init&lt;/code&gt; is called.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;_ZO_DATA_DIR&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Specifies the directory in which the database is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default value varies across OSes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;th&gt;OS&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Path&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Linux / BSD&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/share&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/home/alice/.local/share&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;macOS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;$HOME/Library/Application Support&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support&lt;/code&gt;&lt;td&gt;Windows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;%LOCALAPPDATA%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back when I was a student, I got access to the Microsoft Imagine, and as a result, I got access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called EyesGuard and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came to the realization that Microsoft deleted my app, my developer account, and all those comments on my app supporting me and suggesting ideas on how to improve the program. I tried to contact the support and email whoever I could, but I was ghosted. Nobody ever explained to me why, but I assume it's because of the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notion is a great product, and it was the primary tool I used to manage my personal notes. Not until they suddenly decided to wipe out every data related to the users residing in Iran. Hopefully, they actually responded to my support message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was because of sanctions. However, they told me that they will not restore the data, even if I leave Iran someday:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I am very happy with my own self-hosted Siyuan now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read hackernews on a daily basis and I visit lots of different websites regularly. I am almost always on my VPN as I am internally firewalled by the government and externally shooed because of the sanctions, so I am probably missing some of these heart-warming messages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My VPN turned off, and opening https://www.grepular.com showed me this message. I actually do not blame the people who do this. I think there is a fundamental misconception that people think because "Islamic Republic" has the word "Republic" in it, it must be a government of people in charge. That's not the case. I have yet to see anyone who actually supports Russian aggression in my real life in Iran. Funny enough, Iran's history is full of backstabs by the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried contacting the author by sending this email:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well.

While browsing HackerNews, I came across your website but was greeted with this message:

&amp;gt; Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.

I wanted to clarify that the decision to support Russia does not represent the Iranian people. That "your decision" refers to the regime, a theocratic minority that rules Iran without democratic legitimacy. The people of Iran have long protested and revolted against this regime, but unfortunately, they face brutal suppression while unarmed.

In my experience, most Iranians around me, including myself, stand firmly with Ukraine and against Russian aggression.

I’m not asking you to reconsider the IP restriction, you have your reasons and I respect that. I simply wanted to share this perspective and express my solidarity with Ukraine.

Slava Ukraini!

Best regards,
Avestura

    &lt;p&gt;I got no replies from them, and I actually didn't expect one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I woke up to the news that GitHub has removed the access of Iranians to their private repositories. Well, that was not good. I tried to launch my own self-hosted instance of Gitea to reduce the damage. However, later, GitHub announced that github is now available in Iran by securing a license from the US government, and we're now good. You see? The weather is good, the birds are singing, GitHub is free again. Fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, GitLab banned every account that once accessed from an Iranian IP, however, to this day, they never lifted the ban, even on public repositories. I guess they couldn't secure a license from the US government, or they simply never cared. Good luck to them in either case, though. GitLab is an amazing software. One can always self-host it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list goes on, and almost all of the services you probabelly heard of is banned here: Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...), Educational platforms (coursera, udemy, etc), Payment software (stripe, paypal, ...).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think any of these companies have bad intentions towards any group of people. They are a business after all. They don't hate their customers; they are just playing the game, and the game has such rules. But if someday some law or government forces me to prevent my services from a group, I'll think twice before writing those &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements. I'll try to have more empathy. People behind those screens are more important than just some rows in my tables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this text, I am NOT asking for the removal of the sanctions targeted at the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am merely remembering some moments on top of my head. For the record, I do not support the actions of the Islamic Republic, and on the contrary, I am in favor of the movements that release the people from such a mafia-like cult ruling a country with thousands of years of history. The actions of the group in charge of Iran are not defensible, and as a matter of fact, the people of Iran are the first layer of victims. Some examples are listed here. I especially feel it differently, as regime thugs put a gun to the throat of a dear person to me, and threatened to kill him if he showed up in protests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, did you know you could return &lt;code&gt;451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/code&gt; when you're going to ban me next time?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
