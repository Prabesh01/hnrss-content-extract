    &lt;p&gt;If you’re mounting solar panels, everybody knows the drill, right? Point them south, angled according to latitude. It’s easy. In a video which demonstrates that [Everyday Dave] is truly out standing in his field, we hear a different story. [Dave] has a year’s worth of data in his Solar Panel Showdown that suggests there are good reasons to mount your panels vertically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, [Dave] is using bifacial solar panels– panels that have cells on both sides. In his preferred orientation, one side faces South, while the other faces North. [Dave] is in the Northern Hemisphere, so those of you Down Under would have to do the opposite, pointing one face North and the other South.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since [Dave] is far from the equator, the N/S vertical orientation beats the pants off of East-West facing panels, especially in winter. What’s interesting is how much better the bifacial panels do compared to the “standard” tilted orientation. While peak power in the summer is much better with the tilted bifacial panels (indeed, even the tilted single-sided panels), in winter the vertical N/S panels blow them out of the water. (Especially when snow gets involved. Vertical panels don’t need sweeping!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in the summer, though, there are advantages: the N/S panels may produce less power overall, but they give a trickle earlier and later in the day than the tilted orientation. Still, that extra peak power really shows, and over a six-month period from solstice-to-solstice, the vertical panels only produced 77% what the tilted bifacial panels did (while tilted single-sided panels produced 90%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it worth it? That depends on your use case. If most of the power is going to A/C, you’ll need the extra in the warmer months. In that case, you want to tilt the panels. If you have a steady, predictable load, though, having even production winter/summer might be more to your liking– in that case you can join [Dave] in sticking solar panels straight up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results probably apply at latitudes similar to [Dave] who is in cloudy and snowy Ohio, which is perhaps not the ideal place for solar experimentation. If you’re not an Ohio-like distance from the equator, you might find an East-West array is the best bang for the buck. Of course if you really want to max out power from each individual cell, you can’t beat sun tracking regardless of where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Subtleties of SQLite Indexes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 6 months, Scour has gone from ingesting 330,000 pieces of content per month to over 1.4 million this month. The massive increase in the number of items slowed down the ranking for users' feeds and sent me looking for ways to speed it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After spending too many hours trying in vain to squeeze more performance out of my queries and indexes, I dug into how SQLite's query planner uses indexes, learned some of the subtleties that explained why my initial tweaks weren't working, and sped up one of my main queries by ~35%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scour's &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scour is a personalized content feed that finds articles, blog posts, etc related to users' interests. For better and for worse, Scour does its ranking on the fly whenever users load their feeds page. Initially, this took 100 milliseconds or less, thanks to binary vector embeddings and the fact that it's using SQLite so there is no network latency to load data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important table in Scour's database is the &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; table. It includes an ID, URL, title, language, publish date (stored as a Unix timestamp), and a text quality rating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scour's main ranking query filters items based on when they were published, whether they are in a language the user understands, and whether they are above a certain quality threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question is: what indexes do we need to speed up this query?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don't bother with multiple single-column indexes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first set up Scour's database, I put a bunch of indexes on the &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; table without really thinking about whether they would help. For example, I had separate indexes on the published date, the language, and the quality rating. Useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's more important to have one or a small handful of good composite indexes on multiple columns than to have separate indexes on each column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, the query planner won't bother merging the results from two indexes on the same table. Instead, it will use one of the indexes and then scan all of the rows that match the filter for that index's column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth being careful to only add indexes that will be used by real queries. Having additional indexes on each column won't hurt read performance. However, each index takes up storage space and more indexes will slow down writes, because all of the indexes need to be updated when new rows are inserted into the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we're going to have an index on multiple columns, which columns should we include and what order should we put them in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Index column order matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order of conditions in a query doesn't matter, but the order of columns in an index very much does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Columns that come earlier in the index should be more "selective": they should help the database narrow the results set as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Scour's case, the most selective column is the publish date, followed by the quality rating, followed by the language. I put an index on those columns in that order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE INDEX idx_items_published_quality_lang
ON items(published, low_quality_probability, lang);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...and found that SQLite was only using one of the columns. Running this query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT id, low_quality_probability
FROM items
WHERE published BETWEEN $1 AND $2
AND low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= $3
AND lang IN (SELECT lang FROM user_languages WHERE user_id = $4)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produced this query plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
   |--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_items_published_quality_lang (published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
   `--CORRELATED LIST SUBQUERY 1
      `--SCAN user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was using the right index but only filtering by &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; (note the part of the plan that says &lt;code&gt;(published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)&lt;/code&gt;). Puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Left to right, no skipping, stops at the first range&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My aha moment came while watching Aaron Francis' High Performance SQLite course. He said the main rule for SQLite indexes is: "Left to right, no skipping, stops at the first range." (This is a much clearer statement of the implications of the Where Clause Analysis buried in the Query Optimizer Overview section of the official docs.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rule means that the query planner will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consider columns from left to right. In my case, the first column in the index is &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;. SQLite will search for rows where the&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;field is in the correct range before considering the other columns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No skipping means that SQLite cannot use only the 1st and 3rd column in an index. As soon as it reaches a column in the index that does not appear in the query, it must do a scan through all of the rows matching the 1st column.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stops at the first range. That was the key I was missing. Filtering by the &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;timestamp first would indeed narrow down the results more than filtering first by one of the other columns. However, the fact that the query uses a range condition on the&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;column (&lt;code&gt;WHERE published BETWEEN $1 AND $2&lt;/code&gt;) means that SQLite can only scan all of the rows in that&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;range, rather than fully utilizing the other columns in the index to hone in on the correct rows.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My query includes two ranges (&lt;code&gt;published BETWEEN $1 AND $2 AND low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= $3&lt;/code&gt;), so the "stops at the first range" rule explains why I was only seeing the query planner use one of those columns. This rule does, however, suggest that I can create an index that will allow SQLite to filter by the one non-range condition (&lt;code&gt;lang IN (SELECT lang FROM user_languages WHERE user_id = $4)&lt;/code&gt;) before using one of the ranges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE INDEX idx_lang_published_quality
ON items(lang, published, low_quality_probability);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The query plan shows that it can use both the &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; columns (note the part that reads &lt;code&gt;lang=? AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
|--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_items_lang_published_quality (lang=? AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
`--LIST SUBQUERY 1
   `--SEARCH user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1 (user_id=?)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we're using two out of the three columns to quickly filter the rows. Can we use all three? (Remember, the query planner won't be able to use multiple range queries on the same index, so we'll need something else.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; conditions for partial indexes must exactly match&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite has a nice feature called Partial Indexes that allows you to define an index that only applies to a subset of the rows matching some conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Scour's case, we only really want items where the &lt;code&gt;low_quality_probability&lt;/code&gt; is less than or equal to 90%. The model I'm using to judge quality isn't that great, so I only trust it to filter out items if it's really sure they're low quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means I can create an index like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CREATE INDEX idx_lang_published_quality_filtered
ON items(lang, published, low_quality_probability)
WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= .9;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then update the query to use the same &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; condition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT id, low_quality_probability
FROM items
WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= 0.9
AND published BETWEEN $1 AND $2
AND low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= $3
AND lang IN (SELECT lang FROM user_languages WHERE id = $4)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it should use our new partial index... right? Wrong. This query is still using the previous index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
|--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_items_lang_published_quality (lang=? AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
`--LIST SUBQUERY 1
   `--SEARCH user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1 (user_id=?)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a subtle mistake in the relationship between our index and our query. Can you spot it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our index contains the condition &lt;code&gt;WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt; but our query says &lt;code&gt;WHERE low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= 0.9&lt;/code&gt;. These are mathematically equivalent but they are not exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite's query planner requires the conditions to match exactly in order for it to use a partial index. Relatedly, a condition of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0.95&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0.5 + 0.4&lt;/code&gt; in the query would also not utilize the partial index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we rewrite our query to use the exact same condition of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt;, we get the query plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUERY PLAN
|--SEARCH items USING COVERING INDEX idx_lang_published_quality_filtered (ANY(lang) AND published&amp;gt;? AND published&amp;lt;?)
`--CORRELATED LIST SUBQUERY 1
   `--SCAN user_languages USING COVERING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_user_languages_1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we're starting with the items whose &lt;code&gt;low_quality_probability &amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt;, then using the index to find the items in the desired language(s), and lastly narrowing down the results to the items that were published in the correct time range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Better query plans find matching rows faster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the intro, these changes to the indexes and one of Scour's main ranking queries yielded a ~35% speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enabling the query planner to make better use of the indexes makes it so that SQLite doesn't need to scan as many rows to find the ones that match the query conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concretely, in Scour's case, filtering by language removes about 30% of items for most users and filtering out low quality content removes a further 50%. Together, these changes reduce the number of rows scanned by around 66%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, however, a 66% reduction in the number of rows scanned does not directly translate to a 66% speedup in the query. If we're doing more than counting rows, the work to load the data out of the database and process it can be more resource intensive than scanning rows to match conditions. (The optimized queries and indexes still load the same number of rows as before, they just identifying the desired rows faster.) Nevertheless, a 35% speedup is a noticeable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth digging into how your database's query planner uses indexes to help get to the bottom of performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're working with SQLite, remember that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A smaller number of composite indexes are more useful that multiple single-column indexes. It's better to have an index over &lt;code&gt;(lang, published, low_quality_probability)&lt;/code&gt;than separate indexes for each.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The query planner uses the rule "Left to right, no skipping, stops at the first range". If a query has multiple range conditions, it may be worth putting the columns that use strict equality first in the index, like we did above with &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt;coming before&lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;low_quality_probability&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conditions used in &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;clauses for partial indexes must exactly match the condition used in the corresponding query.&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0.9&lt;/code&gt;is not exactly the same as&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= .9&lt;/code&gt;, even if they are mathematically equivalent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Aaron Francis for putting together the High Performance SQLite course! (I have no personal or financial relationship to him, but I appreciate his course unblocking me and helping me speed up Scour's ranking.) Thank you also to Adam Gluck and Alex Kesling for feedback on this post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;K-means by another means&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait. Does k-means count as machine learning? Yes. Yes, it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CS229 is the graduate-level machine learning course I took at Stanford as part of the Graduate Certificate in AI which I received back in 2021. While k-means is my choice as the easiest to understand algorithm in machine learning, it was taught as the introductory clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning. As a TA for XCS229, which I have been doing since 2022 and most recently did this Spring, I know that it is still being taught as part of this seminal course in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We have liftoff!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike previously where I saved the result for the end, let’s start by taking a look at the algorithm in action!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of the final decision boundary after convergence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final accuracy is 90% because 1 of the 10 observations is on the incorrect side of the decision boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For debugging purposes, to speed up execution, I reduced the number of samples in each class to 5. (You might note that, on the graph, there are only 4 points in class 1, which are the □s. That’s because one of the points is at &lt;code&gt;(291, 90)&lt;/code&gt;, which is off the edge of the screen. Gaussian distributions can generate extreme outliers, so I decided to preserve those points rather than clip them to the edge of the screen.) That’s obviously pretty small but you can see the algorithm iterating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of each loop I draw a line between the latest estimates of cluster centroids. The perpendicular bisector of these segments are the decision boundaries between the classes, so I draw them, too. Some of the code was written to handle more than two classes but here there are only two which makes this relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;K-means explained&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;K-means clustering is a recursive algorithm that aims to partition \(n\) observations into \(k\) clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, called the cluster centroid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Initialize&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Produce and initial set of k cluster centroids. This can be done by randomly choosing k observations from the dataset.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Step 1 - Assignment&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Using Euclidean distance to the centroids, assign each observation to a cluster.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Step 2 - Update&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;For each cluster, recompute the centroid using the newly assigned observations. If the centroids change (outside of a certain tolerance), go back to step 1 and repeat.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ezpz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The math is also simple. In step 1, the distance between two points, \(x\) and \(y\), is simply \(\sqrt{(x_0 - y_0)^2 + (x_1 - y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_{d-1} - y_{d-1})^2}\), where \(d\) is the dimensionality of the observations. In our case \(d=2\) which is why we only have \(x_0\) and \(x_1\). Also, since we’re only using the distances for comparative purposes, it’s not even necessary to take the square root. In step 2, the centroid is simply the sum of all the points divided by the number of points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a little housekeeping before getting to the implementation of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At the very top of the program I decided to organize everything into subroutines. The idea here is to enable expansion into other ML algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “wait for key” subroutine is the APPLESOFT BASIC method for simply waiting for any keystroke before continuing. (&lt;code&gt;PEEK&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;POKE&lt;/code&gt; are commands for directly accessing addresses in memory. I had those numbers memorized in high school but, naturally, I had to look them up.) I thought it’d be nice to add this pause after generating the data but I might take it out later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, at the end of the “hyperparameters” section I declare a convenience array, &lt;code&gt;P%(2,1)&lt;/code&gt; to keep track of 3 random points as well as a few arrays I’m going to use in the k-means algorithm. The reason I do this here is because in APPLESOFT BASIC you get an error if you declare an array that already exists. Should at some point I want to call the k-means algorithm multiple times, this won’t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Initialize&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting started, the first thing to do is initialize the algorithm by generating \(k\) cluster centroids. (\(k\) is a hyperparameter that specifies the number of clusters to be “found.” I set it previously with &lt;code&gt;KN = 2&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I start by clearing out the prediction column, \(y\), of the dataset table, &lt;code&gt;DS%(NS - 1,3)&lt;/code&gt; because I’m going to use this to make sure I don’t randomly pick the same point twice. Then for each class I randomly pick a point from the dataset. If it’s already been used I randomly pick another. &lt;code&gt;KM(KN - 1, 2)&lt;/code&gt; is where I store the means for each cluster along with a count of the number of points in each cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I draw a line between the cluster centroids. This loop does not take into account all combinations of centroids (it works fine if \(k=2\)) and generates an error if a centroid is off the screen, which is possible, so I might just get rid of this later, since it’s not really necessary, rather than try to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 1 - Assignment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fist step is to assign every data point to the nearest cluster centroid.&lt;/p&gt;

2560 IF A &amp;lt; 0.5 THEN A = 1 - A
2570 PRINT "ACCURACY = "; INT(A*10000+0.5)/100;"%"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assignment step is also quite easy. I loop through all the data points, computing the Euclidean distance to each cluster centroid. (Since &lt;code&gt;SQRT()&lt;/code&gt; is expensive, and unnecessary here since we’re just comparing, I actually just compute the square of the Euclidean distance.) If the distance is less than the previous minimum distance, &lt;code&gt;DI(I,DS%(I,3))&lt;/code&gt;, I update the assignment, &lt;code&gt;DS%(I,3) = J&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end, I compute the accuracy of the computed assignments by simply counting the number of assignments, &lt;code&gt;DS%(I,3)&lt;/code&gt;, that match the actual labels, &lt;code&gt;DS%(I,2)&lt;/code&gt;. Here, however, there’s an interesting wrinkle: with two classes, half the time the label I choose for the assignment is the opposite of the label from the original dataset. K-means doesn’t require the distinction, so at times I was seeing a perfect classification reporting 0% accuracy. The line &lt;code&gt;IF A &amp;lt; 0.5 THEN A = 1 - A&lt;/code&gt; addresses this, however, it only works for 2 classes. I’ll need something more robust should I want this to work for \(k &amp;gt; 2\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 2 - Update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second step is to recompute the cluster centroids based on the assigned data points. Convergence occurred if the centroids don’t change (within a tolerance) from the previous iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I start by saving the cluster centroids to &lt;code&gt;KO(KN - 1,1)&lt;/code&gt;. This is used later to determine convergence. I then iterate through ever data point, adding it’s values to the cluster to which it belongs while keeping track of the number of data points in each cluster. Next I iterate through each cluster and compute the mean of each dimension by dividing by the number of data point in that cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I determine if there’s convergence by measuring how far all the centroid have moved. (Again, I don’t bother with the &lt;code&gt;SQRT()&lt;/code&gt;.) If the answer is more than the specified tolerance, \(0.01\), I go back to Step #1. Otherwise, I clear the graphics, redraw the axis and data points and finish by drawing the decision boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing the decision boundary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code is a slog and it’s not really critical to understanding ML but I thought it’d be cool to drawn a decision boundary while k-means is iterating and then again at the end. Given a point (the midpoint on the segment between two cluster centroids) and a slope (which is perpendicular to that segment), the challenge is to drawn a line inside the ‘box’ of the screen, assuming the line intersects that box.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Without delving too far into the details, this routine relies heavily on the convenience array, &lt;code&gt;P%(2,1)&lt;/code&gt;, that I declared during the “hyperparameters” routine. I start by computing the slope of the perpendicular segment connecting two centroids. I then find the midpoint of that segment. (By the way, this routine also does not account for all combinations of centroids, but it works when \(k=2\).) I accommodate for when the slope is vertical and use &lt;code&gt;P%(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;P%(0,1)&lt;/code&gt; to store the midpoint between the two centroids and &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; for the slope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then iterate through the 4 sides of the ‘box’ on the screen, using the corners &lt;code&gt;(10,10)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(269,149)&lt;/code&gt; so that the decision boundary isn’t drawn all the way to the edges of the screen. I thought that would look prettier this way. I next determine if the decision boundary intersects, respectively, the left, right, top and bottom edges of the box. I use &lt;code&gt;NX&lt;/code&gt; to keep track of the number of sides of the box intersected by the decision boundary and &lt;code&gt;P%(NX,0)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;P%(NX,1)&lt;/code&gt; to keep track of those intersections. If &lt;code&gt;NX = 3&lt;/code&gt;, which means there are two intersections, I draw the line because it’s inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Can we do better?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Yes, we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While k-means is simple, it does not take advantage of our knowledge of the Gaussian nature of the data. If we know that the distributions are Gaussian, which is very frequently the case in machine learning, we can employ a more powerful algorithm: Expectation Maximization (EM). This post is already long enough, so we’ll deal with that another day. Eventually, perhaps, we’ll also get to deep learning, although developing back propagation for an arbitrary size neural net using APPLESOFT BASIC on an Apple ][+ is not going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model in the world. It's the strongest model for building complex agents. It’s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code is everywhere. It runs every application, spreadsheet, and software tool you use. Being able to use those tools and reason through hard problems is how modern work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 makes this possible. We're releasing it along with a set of major upgrades to our products. In Claude Code, we've added checkpoints—one of our most requested features—that save your progress and allow you to roll back instantly to a previous state. We've refreshed the terminal interface and shipped a native VS Code extension. We've added a new context editing feature and memory tool to the Claude API that lets agents run even longer and handle even greater complexity. In the Claude apps, we've brought code execution and file creation (spreadsheets, slides, and documents) directly into the conversation. And we've made the Claude for Chrome extension available to Max users who joined the waitlist last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're also giving developers the building blocks we use ourselves to make Claude Code. We're calling this the Claude Agent SDK. The infrastructure that powers our frontier products—and allows them to reach their full potential—is now yours to build with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the most aligned frontier model we’ve ever released, showing large improvements across several areas of alignment compared to previous Claude models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is available everywhere today. If you’re a developer, simply use &lt;code&gt;claude-sonnet-4-5&lt;/code&gt; via the Claude API. Pricing remains the same as Claude Sonnet 4, at $3/$15 per million tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Frontier intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is state-of-the-art on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, which measures real-world software coding abilities. Practically speaking, we’ve observed it maintaining focus for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a significant leap forward on computer use. On OSWorld, a benchmark that tests AI models on real-world computer tasks, Sonnet 4.5 now leads at 61.4%. Just four months ago, Sonnet 4 held the lead at 42.2%. Our Claude for Chrome extension puts these upgraded capabilities to use. In the demo below, we show Claude working directly in a browser, navigating sites, filling spreadsheets, and completing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model also shows improved capabilities on a broad range of evaluations including reasoning and math:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts in finance, law, medicine, and STEM found Sonnet 4.5 shows dramatically better domain-specific knowledge and reasoning compared to older models, including Opus 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model’s capabilities are also reflected in the experiences of early customers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;We're seeing state-of-the-art coding performance from Claude Sonnet 4.5, with significant improvements on longer horizon tasks. It reinforces why many developers using Cursor choose Claude for solving their most complex problems.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 amplifies GitHub Copilot's core strengths. Our initial evals show significant improvements in multi-step reasoning and code comprehension—enabling Copilot's agentic experiences to handle complex, codebase-spanning tasks better.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is excellent at software development tasks, learning our codebase patterns to deliver precise implementations. It handles everything from debugging to architecture with deep contextual understanding, transforming our development velocity.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 reduced average vulnerability intake time for our Hai security agents by 44% while improving accuracy by 25%, helping us reduce risk for businesses with confidence.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is state of the art on the most complex litigation tasks. For example, analyzing full briefing cycles and conducting research to synthesize excellent first drafts of an opinion for judges, or interrogating entire litigation records to create detailed summary judgment analysis.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5's edit capabilities are exceptional — we went from 9% error rate on Sonnet 4 to 0% on our internal code editing benchmark. Higher tool success at lower cost is a major leap for agentic coding. Claude Sonnet 4.5 balances creativity and control perfectly.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 delivers impressive gains on our most complex, long-context tasks—from engineering in our codebase to in-product features and research. It's noticeably more intelligent and a big leap forward, helping us push what 240M+ users can design with Canva.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 has noticeably improved Figma Make in early testing, making it easier to prompt and iterate. Teams can explore and validate their ideas with more functional prototypes and smoother interactions, while still getting the design quality Figma is known for.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Sonnet 4.5 represents a new generation of coding models. It's surprisingly efficient at maximizing actions per context window through parallel tool execution, for example running multiple bash commands at once.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;For Devin, Claude Sonnet 4.5 increased planning performance by 18% and end-to-end eval scores by 12%—the biggest jump we've seen since the release of Claude Sonnet 3.6. It excels at testing its own code, enabling Devin to run longer, handle harder tasks, and deliver production-ready code.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows strong promise for red teaming, generating creative attack scenarios that accelerate how we study attacker tradecraft. These insights strengthen our defenses across endpoints, identity, cloud, data, SaaS, and AI workloads.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 resets our expectations—it handles 30+ hours of autonomous coding, freeing our engineers to tackle months of complex architectural work in dramatically less time while maintaining coherence across massive codebases.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;For complex financial analysis—risk, structured products, portfolio screening—Claude Sonnet 4.5 with thinking delivers investment-grade insights that require less human review. When depth matters more than speed, it's a meaningful step forward for institutional finance.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our most aligned model yet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as being our most capable model, Claude Sonnet 4.5 is our most aligned frontier model yet. Claude’s improved capabilities and our extensive safety training have allowed us to substantially improve the model’s behavior, reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking. For the model’s agentic and computer use capabilities, we’ve also made considerable progress on defending against prompt injection attacks, one of the most serious risks for users of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can read a detailed set of safety and alignment evaluations, which for the first time includes tests using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, in the Claude Sonnet 4.5 system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5 is being released under our AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) protections, as per our framework that matches model capabilities with appropriate safeguards. These safeguards include filters called classifiers that aim to detect potentially dangerous inputs and outputs—in particular those related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These classifiers might sometimes inadvertently flag normal content. We’ve made it easy for users to continue any interrupted conversations with Sonnet 4, a model that poses a lower CBRN risk. We've already made significant progress in reducing these false positives, reducing them by a factor of ten since we originally described them, and a factor of two since Claude Opus 4 was released in May. We’re continuing to make progress in making the classifiers more discerning1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Claude Agent SDK&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've spent more than six months shipping updates to Claude Code, so we know what it takes to build and design AI agents. We've solved hard problems: how agents should manage memory across long-running tasks, how to handle permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and how to coordinate subagents working toward a shared goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re making all of this available to you. The Claude Agent SDK is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, but it shows impressive benefits for a very wide variety of tasks, not just coding. As of today, you can use it to build your own agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built Claude Code because the tool we wanted didn’t exist yet. The Agent SDK gives you the same foundation to build something just as capable for whatever problem you're solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus research preview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re releasing a temporary research preview alongside Claude Sonnet 4.5, called "Imagine with Claude".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this experiment, Claude generates software on the fly. No functionality is predetermined; no code is prewritten. What you see is Claude creating in real time, responding and adapting to your requests as you interact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a fun demonstration showing what Claude Sonnet 4.5 can do—a way to see what's possible when you combine a capable model with the right infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Imagine with Claude" is available to Max subscribers for the next five days. We encourage you to try it out on claude.ai/imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Further information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recommend upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all uses. Whether you’re using Claude through our apps, our API, or Claude Code, Sonnet 4.5 is a drop-in replacement that provides much improved performance for the same price. Claude Code updates are available to all users. Claude Developer Platform updates, including the Claude Agent SDK, are available to all developers. Code execution and file creation are available on all paid plans in the Claude apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For complete technical details and evaluation results, see our system card, model page, and documentation. For more information, explore our engineering posts and research post on cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SWE-bench Verified: All Claude results were reported using a simple scaffold with two tools—bash and file editing via string replacements. We report 77.2%, which was averaged over 10 trials, no test-time compute, and 200K thinking budget on the full 500-problem SWE-bench Verified dataset.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The score reported uses a minor prompt addition: "You should use tools as much as possible, ideally more than 100 times. You should also implement your own tests first before attempting the problem."&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A 1M context configuration achieves 78.2%, but we report the 200K result as our primary score as the 1M configuration was implicated in our recent inference issues.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For our "high compute" numbers we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;We sample multiple parallel attempts.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;We discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repository, similar to the rejection sampling approach adopted by Agentless (Xia et al. 2024); note no hidden test information is used.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;We then use an internal scoring model to select the best candidate from the remaining attempts.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This results in a score of 82.0% for Sonnet 4.5.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Terminal-Bench: All scores reported use the default agent framework (Terminus 2), with XML parser, averaging multiple runs during different days to smooth the eval sensitivity to inference infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;τ2-bench: Scores were achieved using extended thinking with tool use and a prompt addendum to the Airline and Telecom Agent Policy instructing Claude to better target its known failure modes when using the vanilla prompt. A prompt addendum was also added to the Telecom User prompt to avoid failure modes from the user ending the interaction incorrectly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AIME: Sonnet 4.5 score reported using sampling at temperature 1.0. The model used 64K reasoning tokens for the Python configuration.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OSWorld: All scores reported use the official OSWorld-Verified framework with 100 max steps, averaged across 4 runs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MMMLU: All scores reported are the average of 5 runs over 14 non-English languages with extended thinking (up to 128K).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finance Agent: All scores reported were run and published by Vals AI on their public leaderboard. All Claude model results reported are with extended thinking (up to 64K) and Sonnet 4.5 is reported with interleaved thinking on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All OpenAI scores reported from their GPT-5 post, GPT-5 for developers post, GPT-5 system card (SWE-bench Verified reported using n=500), Terminal Bench leaderboard (using Terminus 2), and public Vals AI leaderboard. All Gemini scores reported from their model web page, Terminal Bench leaderboard (using Terminus 1), and public Vals AI leaderboard.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Buy it in ChatGPT: Instant Checkout and the Agentic Commerce Protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re taking first steps toward agentic commerce in ChatGPT with new ways for people, AI agents, and businesses to shop together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 700 million people turn to ChatGPT each week for help with everyday tasks, including finding products they love. Starting today, we’re taking the first steps toward ChatGPT helping people buy them too—beginning with Instant Checkout, powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol, built with Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Free users can now buy directly from U.S. Etsy sellers right in chat, with over a million Shopify merchants, like Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx and Vuori, coming soon. Today, Instant Checkout supports single-item purchases. Next, we’ll add multi-item carts and expand merchants and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also open-sourcing(opens in a new window) the technology that powers Instant Checkout, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, so that more merchants and developers can begin building their integrations. The Agentic Commerce Protocol is an open standard for AI commerce that lets AI agents, people, and businesses work together to complete purchases. We co-developed it with Stripe(opens in a new window) and leading merchant partners to be powerful, secure, and easy to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This marks the next step in agentic commerce, where ChatGPT doesn’t just help you find what to buy, it also helps you buy it. For shoppers, it’s seamless: go from chat to checkout in just a few taps. For sellers, it’s a new way to reach hundreds of millions of people while keeping full control of their payments, systems, and customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re making this protocol and our documentation(opens in a new window) available today so interested merchants and developers can begin building integrations. When you’re ready to make your products available for purchase through ChatGPT, you can apply here(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When someone asks a shopping question—“best running shoes under $100” or “gifts for a ceramics lover” — ChatGPT shows the most relevant products from across the web. Product results are organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a product supports Instant Checkout, users can tap “Buy,” confirm their order, shipping, and payment details, and complete the purchase without ever leaving the chat. Existing ChatGPT subscribers can pay with their card on file, or other card and express payment options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Orders, payments, and fulfillment are handled by the merchant using their existing systems. ChatGPT simply acts as the user’s AI agent—securely passing information between user and merchant, just like a digital personal shopper would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Merchants pay a small fee on completed purchases, but the service is free for users, doesn’t affect their prices, and doesn’t influence ChatGPT’s product results. Instant Checkout items are not preferred in product results. When ranking multiple merchants that sell the same product, ChatGPT considers factors like availability, price, quality, whether a merchant is the primary seller, and whether Instant Checkout is enabled, to optimize the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the core of this experience is the Agentic Commerce Protocol(opens in a new window) which provides the language that lets AI agents and businesses work together to complete a purchase for a user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built the Agentic Commerce Protocol with Stripe and leading merchants to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Work across platforms, payment processors, and business types.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Integrate quickly without changing their backend systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep merchants in control of the customer relationship as the merchant of record across the purchase journey–from fulfillment and returns to support and communication.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When someone places an order, ChatGPT sends the necessary details to the merchant’s backend using Agentic Commerce Protocol. The merchant accepts or declines the order, processes the payment via their existing provider, and handles fulfillment and customer support exactly as they do today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a merchant already processes payments with Stripe(opens in a new window), they can enable agentic payments in as little as one line of code. If they use another payment processor, they can still participate in Instant Checkout and accept agentic payments either by using Stripe’s new Shared Payment Token API(opens in a new window) or adopting the Delegated Payments Spec in the Agentic Commerce Protocol—all without changing their existing payment processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe agentic commerce should be built for trust. In this early stage of the AI commerce future:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Users stay in control — they explicitly confirm each step before any action is taken.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Payment is secure — encrypted payment tokens are only authorized for specific amounts and specific merchants with the user’s permission.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data sharing is minimal — only the information required to complete the order is shared with the merchant, with the user’s permission.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Partner perspectives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Stripe is building the economic infrastructure for AI. That means re-architecting today’s commerce systems and creating new AI-powered experiences for billions of people. We’re proud to power Instant Checkout in ChatGPT and co-develop the Agentic Commerce Protocol to help businesses and AI platforms build the future of commerce."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This launch is just the beginning. As AI becomes a key interface for how people discover, decide, and buy, the Agentic Commerce Protocol provides a foundation that connects people and businesses for the next era of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Don't Become a Scientist!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jonathan I. Katz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professor of Physics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Washington University, St. Louis, Mo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[my last name]@wuphys.wustl.edu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you thinking of becoming a scientist? Do you want to uncover the mysteries of nature, perform experiments or carry out calculations to learn how the world works? Forget it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Science is fun and exciting. The thrill of discovery is unique. If you are smart, ambitious and hard working you should major in science as an undergraduate. But that is as far as you should take it. After graduation, you will have to deal with the real world. That means that you should not even consider going to graduate school in science. Do something else instead: medical school, law school, computers or engineering, or something else which appeals to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why am I (a tenured professor of physics) trying to discourage you from following a career path which was successful for me? Because times have changed (I received my Ph.D. in 1973, and tenure in 1976). American science no longer offers a reasonable career path. If you go to graduate school in science it is in the expectation of spending your working life doing scientific research, using your ingenuity and curiosity to solve important and interesting problems. You will almost certainly be disappointed, probably when it is too late to choose another career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American universities train roughly twice as many Ph.D.s as there are jobs for them. When something, or someone, is a glut on the market, the price drops. In the case of Ph.D. scientists, the reduction in price takes the form of many years spent in ``holding pattern'' postdoctoral jobs. Permanent jobs don't pay much less than they used to, but instead of obtaining a real job two years after the Ph.D. (as was typical 25 years ago) most young scientists spend five, ten, or more years as postdocs. They have no prospect of permanent employment and often must obtain a new postdoctoral position and move every two years. For many more details consult the Young Scientists' Network or read the account in the May, 2001 issue of the Washington Monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As examples, consider two of the leading candidates for a recent Assistant Professorship in my department. One was 37, ten years out of graduate school (he didn't get the job). The leading candidate, whom everyone thinks is brilliant, was 35, seven years out of graduate school. Only then was he offered his first permanent job (that's not tenure, just the possibility of it six years later, and a step off the treadmill of looking for a new job every two years). The latest example is a 39 year old candidate for another Assistant Professorship; he has published 35 papers. In contrast, a doctor typically enters private practice at 29, a lawyer at 25 and makes partner at 31, and a computer scientist with a Ph.D. has a very good job at 27 (computer science and engineering are the few fields in which industrial demand makes it sensible to get a Ph.D.). Anyone with the intelligence, ambition and willingness to work hard to succeed in science can also succeed in any of these other professions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typical postdoctoral salaries begin at $27,000 annually in the biological sciences and about $35,000 in the physical sciences (graduate student stipends are less than half these figures). Can you support a family on that income? It suffices for a young couple in a small apartment, though I know of one physicist whose wife left him because she was tired of repeatedly moving with little prospect of settling down. When you are in your thirties you will need more: a house in a good school district and all the other necessities of ordinary middle class life. Science is a profession, not a religious vocation, and does not justify an oath of poverty or celibacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, you don't go into science to get rich. So you choose not to go to medical or law school, even though a doctor or lawyer typically earns two to three times as much as a scientist (one lucky enough to have a good senior-level job). I made that choice too. I became a scientist in order to have the freedom to work on problems which interest me. But you probably won't get that freedom. As a postdoc you will work on someone else's ideas, and may be treated as a technician rather than as an independent collaborator. Eventually, you will probably be squeezed out of science entirely. You can get a fine job as a computer programmer, but why not do this at 22, rather than putting up with a decade of misery in the scientific job market first? The longer you spend in science the harder you will find it to leave, and the less attractive you will be to prospective employers in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are so talented that you can beat the postdoc trap; some university (there are hardly any industrial jobs in the physical sciences) will be so impressed with you that you will be hired into a tenure track position two years out of graduate school. Maybe. But the general cheapening of scientific labor means that even the most talented stay on the postdoctoral treadmill for a very long time; consider the job candidates described above. And many who appear to be very talented, with grades and recommendations to match, later find that the competition of research is more difficult, or at least different, and that they must struggle with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you do eventually obtain a permanent job, perhaps a tenured professorship. The struggle for a job is now replaced by a struggle for grant support, and again there is a glut of scientists. Now you spend your time writing proposals rather than doing research. Worse, because your proposals are judged by your competitors you cannot follow your curiosity, but must spend your effort and talents on anticipating and deflecting criticism rather than on solving the important scientific problems. They're not the same thing: you cannot put your past successes in a proposal, because they are finished work, and your new ideas, however original and clever, are still unproven. It is proverbial that original ideas are the kiss of death for a proposal; because they have not yet been proved to work (after all, that is what you are proposing to do) they can be, and will be, rated poorly. Having achieved the promised land, you find that it is not what you wanted after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can be done? The first thing for any young person (which means anyone who does not have a permanent job in science) to do is to pursue another career. This will spare you the misery of disappointed expectations. Young Americans have generally woken up to the bad prospects and absence of a reasonable middle class career path in science and are deserting it. If you haven't yet, then join them. Leave graduate school to people from India and China, for whom the prospects at home are even worse. I have known more people whose lives have been ruined by getting a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are in a position of leadership in science then you should try to persuade the funding agencies to train fewer Ph.D.s. The glut of scientists is entirely the consequence of funding policies (almost all graduate education is paid for by federal grants). The funding agencies are bemoaning the scarcity of young people interested in science when they themselves caused this scarcity by destroying science as a career. They could reverse this situation by matching the number trained to the demand, but they refuse to do so, or even to discuss the problem seriously (for many years the NSF propagated a dishonest prediction of a coming shortage of scientists, and most funding agencies still act as if this were true). The result is that the best young people, who should go into science, sensibly refuse to do so, and the graduate schools are filled with weak American students and with foreigners lured by the American student visa.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every so often, we find ourselves in the middle of a massive technological wave that starts to upend our presumptions and our ideas about the past, present, and future. These waves come with excess—optimism, excitement, hype, and speculation. Since non-believers don’t invent the future and speculators are always on a hustle, I often turn to practitioners to get a fix on the coordinates of reality. It has always helped me maintain a sense of pragmatic optimism when the rest of the world around me seems either overtly hyperbolic or depressingly pessimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are in the middle of another massive technological wave, thanks to generative artificial intelligence and its offshoot, robotics. A tanker load of money is being poured into these two areas, and it has come with increasingly breathless promotional activity. It warrants a reality check. For that, I turned to Rodney Brooks, who has spent decades in both arenas. The Australian-born Brooks was a Professor of Robotics at MIT and former director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He has founded three companies: iRobot (maker of the Roomba), Rethink Robotics, and now Robust.AI, which now builds warehouse automation robots. He is an academic who entered the startup arena and hasn’t left it since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recently connected for a conversation about robotics, artificial intelligence, and the future. Contrary to many, he believes humans will do just fine in a world filled with robots and AI. He poured cold water on the humanoid robot hype. He also said that if you look at the computer and internet revolutions, the AI revolution is going to take a lot longer than most think. “There’s a tendency to go for the flashy demo. But the flashy demo doesn’t deal with the real environment. It’s going to have to operate in—the messy reality. That’s why it takes so long for these technologies,” he said. He painted a more pragmatic yet optimistic vision ahead. He warned that humanoid hype is creating a lot of false expectations. Excerpts from our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: You have a rare quality as a science person to write about tech in an understandable fashion. I think it’s always helpful to think beyond the tech directly and consider what the consequences are. When I hear people talk about AGI taking over, I point out that we have already become machine-idiots. We just follow the machine blindly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You wrote something about Waymo recently, where you said there is not really full self-driving because there is human intervention. I would argue it’s not even the best human intervention. Waymo dropped me off at a completely different location, even though on the map it showed the right location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: At MIT, I taught big classes with lots of students, so maybe that helped. I came here in an Uber this morning and asked the guy what street we were on. He had no clue. He said, “I just follow it.” (‘It’ being the GPS—Ed.) And that’s the issue—there’s human intervention, but people can’t figure out how to help when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: We are now Machine Idiots. So what are you working on now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: My new company is putting smart carts in fulfillment warehouses. It doesn’t sound like much, but in fulfillment, many people work picking orders and shipping them out. There are enormous warehouses everywhere full of human workers because human hands are just so much better than anything else. They’re picking, putting orders in totes in these carts, and pushing the carts around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve got this cart called Carta that has cameras. It knows where it is, goes to the right place, and helps people figure out where the item they want is. It doesn’t do the grasping—people do the picking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big thing we do is reduce the amount of walking people have to do. In these warehouses, a typical number of steps per day for a person is 30,000. Now we all know what 10,000 steps feels like (it’s about 5 miles), so imagine doing 30,000 steps a day. It’s really hard on people’s bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When they finish a pick-tour, instead of walking back and pushing a heavy cart 400 feet, they just say ‘done,’ and the robot goes off and takes the items to the correct location. We have affordances on the cart that lower the cognitive load. (Affordance is an action humans can easily perceive—Ed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In comparison, the state of the art is that people have scan guns, and on their wrists are tiny screens with character-based software—it’s ’80s or ’90s technology emulated on an Android device. They have to read that to know what bin number, what thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: How does this company relate to all the companies you’ve started?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: My companies have always been about letting the person still have control. The previous one, Rethink Robotics, involved people showing the robot what to do. The Roomba had a handle; if it got stuck, you could pick it up and move it. If a human grabs the Carta cart, they’re now in charge. If you grab its magic handlebar, you are like Superman—you move your hand a little, and it amplifies what you’re doing. We make the floor worker take control and put it in the right place without much physical effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cart knows a ladder and knows not to go near ladders because a person is up there—if it hit one, it would be disastrous. If it’s going down an aisle and there’s a person there, it’s polite, waits for the person to move, tries to go around them. But if a pallet is blocking the aisle, it recognizes that it’s not going to move by itself. There’s no point waiting. It turns around and tells the central system that this aisle is blocked. It’s simple intelligence, which is what we can do today and make reliable. It’s not sexy. It’s technology in the service of making things easier for workers and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: You’re building a product which is simpler, unsexy, but when I think about the Roomba and all the companies you’ve done in the past, they have always made things very futuristic—like some robot is cleaning my house. Whereas now we’re in the phase of automation where we almost take robots for granted as humans, even though you’re solving problems like those robots inside Amazon’s warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Amazon has automated and manual warehouses. We’re trying to put technology in the manual warehouses, whether it’s DHL—our biggest customer—or Amazon. It’s about putting robots in places where there are no robots. And it’s not saying it’s a humanoid that’s going to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re right, it’s not sexy. And you know what that means for me? It’s hard to raise money. “Why aren’t you doing something sexy?” the VCs ask. But this is a $4 trillion market that will be there for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: It’s much easier to fund the promise than a real business, because real businesses have limitations on how fast they can grow. Whereas if you don’t know, you can live (and fund) the dream. There’s nothing wrong with living the dream—that’s how you get to fund crazy things in this industry. But people doing more rational things do pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve been in robotics for a long time. There are misconceptions about robots and robotics. The biggest fallacy is that we think of them in human form. Ten years later, that idea of a humanoid has become so pervasive. We don’t think about things that do robotic tasks, like ad systems that serve ads constantly—they are also robots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: The robots—they’re not embodied. I always say about a physical robot, the physical appearance makes a promise about what it can do. The Roomba was this little disc on the floor. It didn’t promise much—you saw it and thought, that’s not going to clean the windows. But you can imagine it cleaning the floor. But the human form sort of promises it can do anything a human can. And that’s why it’s so attractive to people—it’s selling a promise that is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: What do you think about the current state of robotics in the US versus how people are funding robots and thinking about them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: There’s good news and bad news. The amount of processing power we have now is amazing—amounts of computation and small sensors largely driven by the phone market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With my company, the motors we use are hub motors from electric scooters because they are made in the millions. They’re cheap and much better than the motors you could buy 10 years ago at a much lower price. So instead of building custom motors, we ride that curve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise with GPUs—I think Nvidia is the luckiest company in the world. They were building graphics processing units and they turned out to be able to do the computation of neural networks. The GPUs are great for the vision computations you need to localize, to know where you are—SLAM, simultaneous localization and mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do so much more computation, sensing, some actuation, but people underestimate the long tail of the natural environment. That’s what we see with autonomous vehicles. I first attended a talk on autonomous vehicles in 1979 in Tokyo. By 1990, Ernst Dickmanns in Germany had his truck driving on the Autobahn at 100 kilometers an hour. He took it to Paris, and an autonomous vehicle drove around Paris in 1990. Then in 2007, 2008, people saw the DARPA autonomous vehicle and said, “Oh, it’s going to be everywhere instantly.” But it’s taken almost 20 years, and it’s still only in little tiny geographical areas because of the long tail of all the things that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a tendency to go for the flashy demo, but the flashy demo doesn’t deal with the real environment. It’s going to have to operate in the messy reality. That’s why it takes so long for these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: Like Waymo—they still require human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: That’s why I’m skeptical of the Tesla taxi system. At the last earnings call, Elon said they’re going to have safety drivers in the Teslas and they’re hiring remote drivers. It’s sort of a charade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: There is a habit in our modern society to forget how long it takes for something to actually find its true form, like PCs. I remember using MS-DOS, then eventually where we are today where we don’t even think about what the PC looks like. The same with smartphones—I used the earliest examples from Nokia and Palm and then eventually seeing where we are today. There is a way to minimize the effort needed for technology to find its perfect form, but that’s going to be a challenge for self-driving as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: It’ll take a long time for adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: You did early work on mapping and (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) SLAM about 40 years ago. When you were thinking about that future, how were you thinking about it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: The SLAM paper was released in 1985. I was working on mobile robots, and Waymos are mobile robots. It never occurred to me that there would be, in my lifetime, the level of Waymos we have, even though it’s not where people think it is. I was just wanting to get mobile robots that could move around and do things in the world, and they had to know where they were and how to get somewhere. That was the problem I was solving—just the next few steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, I wrote some whimsical things about home cleaning robots, mixing nanotechnology with robotics. I talked about lots of little robots living on your floor, picking up stuff and putting it in a pile for the big robot to come and suck up the dirt—societies of robots around us, which was a science fiction thing that has not happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: What was the genesis of your fascination with robots?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: I grew up in a working-class environment. My parents didn’t come close to finishing high school. Somehow I just won the genetic lottery. I was born in the ’50s, a white male in an English-speaking country, which turned out to be really important. But on top of that, I had mathematical ability that was so obvious that by the time I was four, my parents referred to me as “the professor.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My parents found these How and Why Wonder books—one on electricity and one on computers and giant brains. The publication date is 1961. I probably got them when I was seven. I read these books, learned how to make circuits out of stuff I had—wires, nails, batteries, flashlight bulbs. The computers had pictures of imagined robots and explained binary systems, so I learned how to build circuits and then saw how to build little bits of computation. I was always trying to build computers for the rest of my childhood because there were no computers available. I tried building robotic devices but wasn’t really good at mechanisms, so I really wanted to build robots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: Where did you grow up?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Adelaide, South Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: Still a fan of cricket?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Here’s my superpower. When I was eight years old, Ian and Greg Chappell coached me when I was a child. It did me zero good—I was so bad. But as far as all my countrymen are concerned, they think I am the luckiest guy on the planet. (The Chappell brothers – Ian and Greg are legends of the game of cricket, much like the baseball legends, the DiMaggio brothers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: When you look at that SLAM paper you wrote, what has been the big lesson of turning something on paper into reality?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: All these things require so much more engineering than some initial idea. My initial idea was loop closing, which is critical to SLAM. But my version of merging observations probabilistically was actually quite terrible. In 1985, someone else who read the paper published a paper a year later to improve on that part. Then other people started to see little pieces—”Oh, I can improve here, I can improve there.” During the ’90s, there were hundreds of papers every year coming out on SLAM. It was a hot topic, and people realized it was going to be important for getting moving robots into environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even now, it’s only in the last five years that we’ve been able to do it with computer vision because we didn’t have enough computational power. Up until recently, it was all LIDAR-based. So technologies wait for other technologies to come along. The computer vision wasn’t driven by that, but then it got good enough to do it. Some things might be a good idea, and you can see how it could work, but it may require so many side technologies that you haven’t worked through all the details to make it practical. That could be a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: Knowing what you know, do you think we need to be rethinking how we approach innovation, education, and our perspective on the world? Forty years may have worked in the pre-network era, but now we live in a post-network world with new intensity and rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: There’s a new rhythm, and what I fear is that everyone jumps into new orthodoxies. For a few years now, people have been saying if you’re not working on neural net-based AI, you’re in the past, you’re a dinosaur. I guarantee there will be things that people have been working on for years that will become important and they’re not neural-based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: You have very strong opinions about generative AI. When I talk to young people, I wonder if we have an entire society trained on an answer-based value metric—we read a book, get an answer, take an exam, give an answer. Whereas generative AI means we’re more question-oriented going forward. The ability to ask the right questions is going to separate us from being really good versus just average. You have to be someone special to be able to ask questions in philosophy and art and robotics and AI. Not everybody can connect the dots. So maybe there’s a whole new class of educational approaches that need to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: I think we need multiple education approaches and not put everything in the same bucket. I see this in Australia—”What’s your bachelor’s degree?” “I’m doing a bachelor’s degree in tourism management.” That’s not an intellectual pursuit, that’s job training, and we should make that distinction. The German system has had this for a long time—job training being a very big part of their education, but it’s not the same as their elite universities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[ Brooks is right in pointing out that we are busy propping up an education system that creates work for an industrial and industrial-version of digital economies. Germans (and many other parts of the world) have this idea of diplomas in specialized trade skills, which is exactly how we are going to be thinking about in the future, because the idea of work, augmented by digitized automation, both robotic and software, will need to evolve. As such, we need to really rethink the entire map of employment and fine-tune “collegial output” in terms of jobs needed to be done in tandem with the emergence of rapid computerized automation. The United States is still trying to use the same template of education that it has for decades. –OM ]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: In India too, we had diplomas which were very targeted—if you wanted to work in a power station, you got a diploma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Australia too, diplomas for teaching primary school, which is honorable. But it’s not necessarily—although I wish, looking back at the history teaching I got, it didn’t teach me about the world because it was just regurgitating “this happened, that happened,” instead of why it happened, what were the intellectual ideas driving it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: I struggled in college because I was always the one asking, “Why are we doing this experiment? What is the outcome? Why are we looking for this outcome?” We already know the answer—some scientist discovered it—but no one explains why we’re repeating it and what we gain from it as students.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: I remember undergraduates working in my lab at MIT. One guy who ended up being a professor would be doing stuff and then say, “That’s why they taught me that thing in that class, now I see what”—because the classes, even at MIT, didn’t necessarily connect why this question is interesting, why it’s important. Then through the practice of trying to build real things, “Oh, that’s what I needed to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: I think of being a journalist as the best education I ever got, especially writing about tech, because I learned about microcontrollers, embedded operating systems, networks, switches, and compute. I also learned about the impact of all these technologies on real people and the real world. There’s no way any college could have taught me that. In this world, I was happier than in school because in school, I wasn’t able to connect the dots. In the real world, the dots were connecting in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look at why I’m okay with all the generative AI stuff that has come to market—I know the right questions to ask. I know how to talk to ChatGPT. I’ve grown up interviewing people, so I know when the response is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Generative AI challenges us intellectually. John Searle at Berkeley talked about the Chinese Room argument. (It says that no matter how smart a computer seems, it can’t have human consciousness.–Ed) Well, the Chinese Room showed up. I recently gave an example. I used Google to give me a Chinese output for: “Who is Ai Weiwei?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cut and pasted those Chinese characters into ChatGPT, and it gave a biography of him. So there’s the Chinese room—I feed in symbols in Chinese and it feeds me back symbols in Chinese. Searle was saying the Chinese room is absurd because they could never understand Chinese just by symbol matching. And here it did it. So there’s a challenge to what it means to understand language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are these rules of language, and the only reason we can understand language is because of biological structures in our brain attuned to language. Here’s generative AI—did it have the universal grammar machine in it, yet it’s so adept at language. So that’s another challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generative AI challenges long-held notions of how things work. In the worst case, it says we’re not as smart as we think we are because this dumb thing can do what we do. We always have a view of ourselves as people being special. I remember when the human genome was decoded and we had fewer genes than a potato—people were outraged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: More is more, right? More must be better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Through the history of mankind—the world is the center of the universe, the sun goes around it, God is up there looking at us. Then we discover other planets, other solar systems, other galaxies, and we’re one of billions of billions of planets. But we’re special! It gets people upset. I was at the World Economic Forum on stage talking about AI and being provocative. Yehudi Menuhin was in the audience and stood up and yelled at me for devaluing humans by talking about machine intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: If you stop thinking about generative AI as this road to AGI and think of it as simply a way to interact with information—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: That’s what I do take it as. If you’d explained it to me 15 years ago, I would have said, “There’s no way that can work.” So it’s a surprise that it works, but it is an encoding of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: What are you thinking about the future right now? How should we contextualize artificial intelligence and robotics? Do you want my really crazy stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: If I look at history and history of ideas, we often get sucked in by the wrong idea. One of my examples is Sir Isaac Newton. Really smart dude—he invented calculus, figured out gravity and movement of bodies in 3D, did optics, split light into multiple colors. But he spent over half his life working on alchemy, trying to convert lead to gold. Really smart guy. Why did he do that? He thought, as everyone did, that it was chemical. They had primitive chemistry. He didn’t know about nuclear—the nucleus is what you have to deal with to convert lead to gold. Everyone thought it was the same kind of thing they were used to, burning stuff and mixing stuff. He had the wrong underlying model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Elon Musk decided he wanted to put stuff into orbit, he didn’t say, “I’ll write a Python script, and that will get stuff into orbit.” He had to figure out how to burn fuel efficiently, worry about mass, liquid flows, high temperatures, because you can write as big a program as you want, it’s not going to get stuff into orbit. Computation is not the stuff you need to physically move things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somehow, we’ve decided that computation is what happens in our brain. Is it really computation? And why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 1945 and 1965, there were four disciplines that were of focus. You have this two-by-two chart of science, and engineering. And you have life and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over here we have neuroscience. Here we have AI. Here we have artificial life. And here we have abiogenesis—turning abiotic into biotic. These four modern computational disciplines all came into being 1945 to 1965. If you look at any two of them, I can show you someone who worked in those two fields. For any three of them, mostly I can find someone who worked in all three fields—von Neumann, McCulloch, a whole bunch of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any of the four have taken computation as their primary metaphor. Abiogenesis is still chemical, not computational. But why are any of these computational? Is that the right stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or are we trying to build a rocket by writing a program, which is doomed to failure? In the same way, Newton was doomed to failure with alchemy because it’s not chemical—it’s nuclear, and no one knew about the nucleus. So that’s my bigger picture. AGI could be 300 years away because we’re dealing in the wrong kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: I am trying to figure out what AGI is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Building a machine which could do all the things we do with our brain. It may be something that we haven’t even thought about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s this assumption of the infinite power of the human mind. I like to think about orcas. Orcas are really smart, really brutal, as we are. There’s great footage where they’re going after seals up on rocks, but they’ve got to sneak up on them in shallow water, so they roll over at 90 degrees so their dorsal fin doesn’t show above water. So they’re solving problems. They have some self-model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we never think they’re going to build a foundry and start smelting metal. We don’t think they’re smart enough, but we think we’re infinitely smart and we’ll solve all these problems with technology. Just like the orcas, we may have limits and we don’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: But humans do solve problems. And look how far we’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: We’ve come so far compared to orcas, but orcas can only come so far. Maybe there’s a natural limit for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: But what I was trying to say is that we have entered a new reality. The world existed pre-internet and post-internet. It was not creating digital data at the speed we generate now, so we need new tools to deal with this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: I agree with you, but I think that’s the pedestrian part of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: I find it more exciting because it’s going to be more disruptive than this idea of AGI. We have all this money going into robots, humanoid robots, and other AI, but we don’t have manufacturing in this country. We don’t make anything. When I look at what China is doing with their EVs or their self-driving cars, they’re building new cities with roads that have sensors—essentially built for this new reality. I feel we are not thinking about the opportunities correctly because the Chinese have the end market for manufacturing. They are very good at manufacturing—that’s what they’ve been doing for the last 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: I started manufacturing in China in the late ’90s. Just last week, my company put out a press release that Foxconn is going to build our robots at scale. They’re based in Taiwan, but it’s undeniable—if you want to do something at scale, that’s how you have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But let’s look ahead to this century. Fifty years from now, all the innovation is going to be happening in Nigeria. They’re going to be such a big part of the world population, and they’re going to have so many problems they have to deal with, and they will deal with them. Nigeria is going to be the center of the technological universe by the end of this century. (Just as China and its large population, and its need to solve its problems made it into an economic powerhouse, Brooks believes the sheer size of Nigeria is going to make it an economic and technological epicenter.–Ed)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: How are we going to have all these companies build robots in the U.S.? What will be our manufacturing? What will be our place in this world? What do we think about the American future in manufacturing? Do we think about a post-capitalist future where scale is not what we think about? How does the world change?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Will manufacturing be driven by 3D printing? It’s not yet. We’re starting to use 3D printing for components of machines. Electron (a New Zealand company) that launches satellites from New Zealand—they 3D print their rocket motors. But they can afford to do that because it’s such a high-value thing. As 3D printing becomes more general, in the same way information technology and payment systems got adopted in the third world more quickly than in the US, 3D printing will become the engine of manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, the supply chain is the reason China is so effective. Chinese manufacturing companies realized they had to diversify and started building supply chains in places like Malaysia, Vietnam. But if 3D printing really gets to be effective, the supply chain becomes all about raw materials that get poured into the front of those 3D printers. It’ll be about certain chemicals, about raw materials, because then every item would ultimately be 3D printed. That completely breaks the dynamic of what made Chinese manufacturing so strong—the supply chain of components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: But then that flies in the face of manufacturing jobs being the savior of any economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: I was at a Brown University commencement giving a talk. And we were bemoaning the loss of US manufacturing. I asked the parents of the about to be Brown graduates—do who wants your kids to work in a factory? Oh no, not us! The poor people need the jobs, not my child. Who aspires that their kid is going to work at the sewage company? This bemoaning of manufacturing being lost is a little duplicitous—it’s not for us, it’s for the poor people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OM: Manufacturing jobs are like a political hot potato. Politicians love to talk about manufacturing jobs as it wins votes. If you believe in the robotic revolution and 3D printing, things are going to be very different 25 years from now. I recently saw a video of BYD’s new factory in China. It is supposed to be as big as the city of San Francisco and it will have only 40,000 people making cars. The rest are all BYD-made robots. That’s the future of manufacturing at scale. This is very counter to the idea of “manufacturing jobs” as politicians like to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: That’s why I brought up 3D printing. There’ll be other technologies that come in, not just robotics. One of the most interesting things is applying AI to creating materials—you can make predictions about what material properties will be and you don’t have to laboriously make each material and test it. As materials change, there’s 3D printing, changes in materials, a whole bunch of things that can come together. My answer is I don’t know, but I know it’s going to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: Before you go, how should we correctly think about robotics and AI. Right now there is a hype way of thinking about it, there is a negative way of thinking about it. What is the right way?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: The right way of thinking about it is that appearance alone is not everything. There are things that are incredibly hard for us to do with technology at the moment, which we just don’t know how to do. So many of the promises of the hype of robotics and AI gloss over things we don’t know how to do well. We do not know how to manipulate things with robot hands. Everyone is excited about a robot hand, and Chinese companies are making the same mistake, thinking that it’s dexterous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the way that we do stuff with our hands, we have no way of reproducing, nor should we think that hands should be five-fingered. When this first structure appeared in animals, it was the first creatures that crawled out of the ocean onto the land. They had five bones to make pads that could be pushed around. This is an accident of evolution. Maybe in the future, the dexterous things will look more like sea anemones, lots of tentacles filled with cilia and they just pour stuff in and it gets manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the correct thing is not to think about it as being a duplication of humans. It’s never a duplication of humans that is the optimal solution or the most cost-effective solution. So it will be different from humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: You’ve said something about quantum computing having an impact and materials and physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: The effective quantum computers for the next 10 years are going to be using quantum computers to simulate physical systems, not doing classical computation way better. That’s still a long way off. I used to make the joke, people would ask me, “When are we going to get quantum computers?” And I would say, “I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure they’re going to be fusion powered.” Now we’re starting to see a diversity of approaches to fusion. Never say never, but for the next few years quantum computers are going to be much more about simulating physical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: If you were to describe yourself right now, would you describe yourself as an optimist about AI or maybe not so much?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: I model myself as a realist. I’ve lived through so many hype cycles in AI. They weren’t as big in public as this one, but they were brutal amongst AI practitioners. The arguments were strong and deeply held—screaming matches would happen. I’ve seen that happen again and again. Neural is ascendant at the moment, but neural was ascendant four or five times before and then got crushed. Something else took over, came back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see that in agentic AI. Now suddenly everyone’s got agent-based AI. They didn’t have it six months ago. I suspect it’s a little more marketing than reality. But when was the first paper on agentic AI published? It was in 1959 by Oliver Selfridge. There’s been agent-based systems—SOAR, there’s been lots. They come and go, all these ideas, and they get improved every time they come back. I’m not saying it’s stupid, I’m just saying as someone who’s been involved, it is not just the shiny new thing. This thing that looks shiny now may not be so shiny in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: But when I think about it, I feel that the amount of money being poured into this sector is going to have an impact. It’s going to push things along much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: It’s going to have an impact and a lot of it will be wasted too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: The networks were overbuilt and then that allowed a company like Google to come in and build out its own network and offer search so cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: There is an upside. Let me tell you my upside version—thinking of how to use all these data centers once the crash comes in training generative AI models. There will be so much competition in these data centers, just sitting there waiting to be used. I’m not going to use it to mine bitcoin, but smart people would be thinking beyond the crash of how to use—as you said, the networks were there, they were overbuilt, they were ready. So I think these data centers are getting overbuilt. They’ll be ready to be used for something new. If you can figure out how to do that, if some kid can figure out how to do that, they’re going to be working right now on it in obscurity and poverty and then boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om: It would have been fun to keep talking, but I know we’ve gone over our time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rodney: Thank you for the conversation. It’s been stimulating to think through these ideas with someone who understands both the technical and broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Governor Newsom signs SB 53, advancing California’s world-leading artificial intelligence industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you need to know: Governor Newsom today signed legislation further establishing California as a world leader in safe, secure, and trustworthy artificial intelligence, creating a new law that helps the state both boost innovation and protect public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SACRAMENTO — Governor Newsom today signed into law Senate Bill 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA), authored by Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) – legislation carefully designed to enhance online safety by installing commonsense guardrails on the development of frontier artificial intelligence models, helping build public trust while also continuing to spur innovation in these new technologies. The new law builds on recommendations from California’s first-in-the-nation report, called for by Governor Newsom and published earlier this year — and helps advance California’s position as a national leader in responsible and ethical AI, the world’s fourth-largest economy, the birthplace of new technology, and the top pipeline for tech talent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it – but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governor Gavin Newsom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;California works closely to foster tech leadership and create an environment where industry and talent thrive. The state is balancing its work to advance AI with commonsense laws to protect the public, embracing the technology to make our lives easier and make government more efficient, effective, and transparent. California’s leadership in the AI industry is helping to guide the world in the responsible implementation and use of this emerging technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“With a technology as transformative as AI, we have a responsibility to support that innovation while putting in place commonsense guardrails to understand and reduce risk. With this law, California is stepping up, once again, as a global leader on both technology innovation and safety. I’m grateful to the Governor for his leadership in convening the Joint California AI Policy Working Group, working with us to refine the legislation, and now signing it into law. His Administration’s partnership helped this groundbreaking legislation promote innovation and establish guardrails for trust, fairness, and accountability in the most remarkable new technology in many years.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senator Scott Wiener&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a group of world-leading AI academics and experts — convened at the request of Governor Newsom — released a first-in-the-nation report on sensible AI guardrails, based on an empirical, science-based analysis of the capabilities and attendant risks of frontier models. The report included recommendations on ensuring evidence-based policymaking, balancing the need for transparency with considerations such as security risks, and determining the appropriate level of regulation in this fast-evolving field. SB 53 is responsive to the recommendations in the report — and will help ensure California’s position as an AI leader. This legislation is particularly important given the failure of the federal government to enact comprehensive, sensible AI policy. SB 53 fills this gap and presents a model for the nation to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Last year Governor Newsom called upon us to study how California should properly approach frontier artificial intelligence development. The Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA) moves us towards the transparency and ‘trust but verify’ policy principles outlined in our report. As artificial intelligence continues its long journey of development, more frontier breakthroughs will occur. AI policy should continue emphasizing thoughtful scientific review and keeping America at the forefront of technology.”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;California’s AI dominance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;California continues to dominate the AI sector. In addition to being the birthplace of AI, the state is home to 32 of the 50 top AI companies worldwide. California leads U.S. demand for AI talent. In 2024, 15.7% of all U.S. AI job postings were in California — #1 by state, well ahead of Texas (8.8% and New York (5.8%), per the 2025 Stanford AI Index. In 2024, more than half of global VC funding for AI and machine learning startups went to companies in the Bay Area. California is also home to three of the four companies that have passed the $3 trillion valuation mark. Each of these California-based companies — Google, Apple, and Nvidia — are tech companies involved in AI and have created hundreds of thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the law does:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SB 53 establishes new requirements for frontier AI developers creating stronger:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Transparency: Requires large frontier developers to publicly publish a framework on its website describing how the company has incorporated national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices into its frontier AI framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Innovation: Establishes a new consortium within the Government Operations Agency to develop a framework for creating a public computing cluster. The consortium, called CalCompute, will advance the development and deployment of artificial intelligence that is safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable by fostering research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Safety: Creates a new mechanism for frontier AI companies and the public to report potential critical safety incidents to California’s Office of Emergency Services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Accountability: Protects whistleblowers who disclose significant health and safety risks posed by frontier models, and creates a civil penalty for noncompliance, enforceable by the Attorney General’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;✅ Responsiveness: Directs the California Department of Technology to annually recommend appropriate updates to the law based on multistakeholder input, technological developments, and international standards.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year PlasticList discovered that 86% of food products they tested contain plastic chemicals—including 100% of baby food tested. The EU just lowered their "safe" BPA limit by 20,000x. Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seemed like a solvable problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: https://laboratory.love&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the tofu reports, I really don't know what to make of them. Is there a way to give more meaning to them for the average person? Also, I'd love to see a sort by "almost funded" option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love this idea. I imagine it could be extended to other types of testing - for example, I've always wished there was a way to more readily verify whether the contents of vitamins were as specified on the label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I LOVE this idea. Tangentially, a more pimitive case: in trying to recycle or reuse jars or carboard containers food comes in, I wish there was a simple service for ranking brands. For example, some jam jars have labels that can be immediatey removed - others tear and stick to the jar. Similarly, some brands use excessive plastics and packaging, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great. I thought about a different model even before plasticlist: make a subscription and test various products, but people will have a number of upvotes based on their sub streak. They vote for food to test, and then you show results to everyone subbed. Kind of like what examined does, but they do deep dives into medical topics for subs. I think this model will work better than the one you currently have. Awesome project anyways!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is extremely weird to me that countries don't do that on taxpayers money and show the results publicly, this is what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I definitely considered a voting mechanism, but there are a few million active, buyable CPG UPCs in the U.S. at any given time. When conducting some basic market research for this project, I found that most people are only willing to pay to find results about the specific products they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would be a good strategy to prevent companies from cottoning on to this and gaming the system? They could for example change packaging on production runs for a product that’s undergoing laboratory.love funding campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an interesting thought. Companies do change packaging somewhat regularly. However, the underlying skew usually remains the same. Changing the packaging and/or the SKU is very expensive. It's probably cheaper and more beneficial to your company to do your own Plastic Chemical testing and get ahead of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My suspicion is if this was gameable, this would be a solved problem by a number of companies. The truth is there is no single simple or even hard step to take, it’s mostly like numerous steps that multiple actors would need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React + Vite + Tailwind on the frontend; Netlify Functions for backend with Stripe, Supabase, and email integrations; content via Markdown build script; deployed on Netlify; linted with ESLint; JavaScript-only codebase&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so incredibly important, well done. The problem of our food being steeped in plastic hits the news here and there, but it should be front and center in my opinion. Testosterone has been plummeting for decades and it scares the heck out of me. The hormone whose job is "form goals, shrug off failure, and try again!" is being destroyed and corporations are given a free pass to pump us full of phthalates and bisphenol. It's infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And anecdotally, I've still been forming goals and shrugging off failure five years into suppressing most of my endogenous testosterone with exogenous estrogen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well that's great for you, but I was making a generalized statement about the role of testosterone, scientific data showing huge decline, and more and more studies linking it to plastics. We can't just alter a key hormone within the span of a few decades and shrug it off. My levels are great for a 40 year old&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes there are certainly other factors, but that's not what the original comment was talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery. Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure. Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision. The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space. Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base. The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically "just works" as opposed to requiring a ton of training. We are debuting at a tradeshow in October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m currently hacking away at a project which turns your keyboard into a clipboard manager, password vault and barcode reader as parts of it. I just need to come up with a better name than totally normal keyboard (:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a solo startup that I've been working on for 2 years now. It's a labor of love and I'm very lucky and thankful that it's big enough to surprisingly pay all of our bills. Still constantly feeling FOMO over all of my startup buddies working with AI and LLMs while I plug away at old maps and GIS .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets ~80K MAUs and just slowly and consistently is growing organically through word of mouth through history focused communities. I'm currently playing with expanding the coverage internationally as I still only support the US which is a wickedly fun project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got into it because I was interested in the technical challenge of registering GPS to maps which are very warped compared to reality, like very old maps or illustrated tourist maps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you looked into speaking with the various SHPOs in each US State/Territory?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've worked with several of them a fair bit and they have a ton of old maps hidden internally. Especially for small, specific areas of the state, like historical districts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023 a friend and I started a monthly dinner club with the goal of eating around the world without getting on a plane. We gather once a month at a restaurant on Long Island for a meal focused on a theme or region of the world. The meals are around 10+ courses and include a drink. We work with the restaurant to craft a menu that is as close to authentic to the region as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first dinner was with 13 friends and has since grown into a group of just about 1,000 members. Last year we generated around $140k for local restaurants on off nights (dinners are on Tues and Wed when business is slow).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we are working on evolving into more of a lifestyle brand for people who love food. I'm currently working on our clothing line and new site, which we quietly launched a few days ago (there's still a few odds and ends to finish): https://www.deadchefssociety.com. Would love any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a new type of git forge[1], optimized for speed and work with patches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes to extreme lengths to ensure great performance, i.e. rewritten most server-side parts of git from scratch, so there is no "exec"-ing git nor calls to libraries like libgit2. The frontend should also be very fast thanks for HTMX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on an ISBN database that fetches information from several other services, such as Hardcover.app, Google Books, and ISBNDB, merges that information, and return something more complete than using them alone. It also saves that information in the database for future lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly because I’m working on a personal library management service called Shelvica to solve my own problems[1], and none of those services provided all the information on a book. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything, so I decided to work on something of my own (called Librario).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Shelvica is the focus, Librario could become its own thing in time, so I don’t mind the sidetracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also plan on having a “ISBN Search” kind of website that feeds from that database as a way to let users search for information about books, which then feeds the service’s database, making it stronger for Shelvica.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I open source everything I make, but I’m still wondering if these will be open sourced or not. I’ll probably go with the EUPL 1.2 license if I do decide on open sourcing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1]: My wife and I have a personal library with around 1800 books, but most applications for management are either focused on ebooks or choke with this many books. Libib is the exception, but I wanted a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Didn’t have the time yet, but it’s on my todo list. I have extractors for Google Books, Hardcover.app, and ISBNDB already working, and Amazon, Goodreads, and Anna’s Archive in the todo list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do plan on including a link to the book on Anna’s Archive in the “ISBN Search” website. At least to the search page with the filters already filled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I attempted something like this because I wanted a good books search service which provided me at-a-glance information I needed from Storygraph &amp;amp; Goodreads. The main things I look for when I search a book is genres/Storygraph's "moods", number of pages, whether it's part of a series, rating across services &amp;amp; how much does it cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey I'd like to learn more about what you're doing. I'm working on a tangentially related service but focusing on audiobooks. One big stumbling block I ran into early on was trying to find something close to a unified ISBN datasource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're up for it, shoot me an email at charles@geuis.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm super curious if anybody will pick it up and do something useful with it. This was a couple of years of my life and I absolutely loved working on it but having a child put a hard stop to such entertainment for many years. Now, a good 30 years later I finally found the time to resurrect it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure yet if I am going to do more work on it or leave it as it is, it's good enough to give someone new to OS development a running start and a foundation to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Happy Coder, an open source Codex and Claude Code native mobile app (plus a web app).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy lets you spawn and control multiple Codex/Claude Code sessions in parallel. Happy Coder runs on your hardware, works from your phone and desktop, costs nothing, End to End encrypted, and permissive MIT License.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy Coder is a unix style "do one thing well" project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is zero workflow disruption. I want to be able to run CLI coding agents on any internet connected computer, and control them with my phone. Happy has a command line wrapper for Codex and Claude Code that let you start a session in your terminal, and then continue it from your phone with real time sync. So type in your terminal and see it on the phone, type into your phone and see it in your terminal. So you can switch back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an optional voice agent some contributors have been hacking on that lets you talk to the voice agent first, and the voice agent then writes prompts for Codex/Claude Code and answers questions about what the coding agent running on your computer is doing/did. The voice agent feature is pretty neat, but in my opinion needs a bit more iteration, so any ideas or help would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next steps are to create more schematics with Circuitscript as examples to test the limitations of the language and to generate PCB designs with KiCAD. The Circuitscript tool (currently only the desktop cli tool) is able to generate KiCAD netlists and this can be imported into PCBnew.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a 3D voxel-based game engine for like 10 years in my spare time. The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is so neat. I built something a little bit like this for a simulator of a 3D portal mill. Trying it on real wood got expensive fast so for debugging runs and trials of designs I would run a simulation where the toolbit would hack out the shape out of a three dimensional array of voxels. This was then displayed using a very simple engine built with PyGame. I got a lot of use out of that and it saved days (and a small forest).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great to see something along those lines but with much better visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make an RF lightning detector small enough to trivially add to my motorbike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in Viet Nam, and driving through bad storms this time of year is pretty miserable, and they happen fast and are local enough that weather prediction is not terribly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of problems with EMI. Lots of ungrounded brushed motors everywhere that make the RF bits hard. If I succeed, I'll publish the PCB designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also got some educational products in production right now, about Vietnamese history. I'd share a link, but my website probably can't handle the traffic right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Pruno (https://pruno.dev/), it's similar to Dependabot/Renovate bot but it removes dependencies instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My team suffers from dependency creep. As soon as your system grows, the number of dependencies skyrockets. In Python/Javascript projects it's especially hard to determine which dependencies are not used anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pruno saves time for your team by automating this work. It's still WIP, but I'd like to get feedback. How are you dealing with your dependencies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It prioritizes accessibility, longevity, performance, and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the autoloader, one script tag loads components dynamically without downloading the entire library. (npm also available.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Theming uses color-mix() and OKLAB to create uniform color palettes from a single CSS property. Adaptive palettes are used for dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All form controls are form-associated via ElementInternals and work with native validation APIs (required, pattern, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dialogs, popovers, tooltips, etc. use Popover API for top-layer access without having to portal or hoist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the more fun components include: Joystick, Stamp, Mesh Gradient, Flip Card, Random Content, Intersection Observer, Typewriter, Lorem Ipsum, Slide Activator&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library is free for personal, educational, non-profit use. Commercial use requires a license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the side, I‘m building a platform that allows to run MCP servers on demand, making them reachable under a public URL, but password-protected. You also get an embedded VNC viewer, and thus you can watch what an AI-agent is doing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes it possible to use your own, dedicated MCP server instances from, for example, n8n workflows, without thinking about infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently building Visirya, an app that helps people record their night dreams and transforms them into short videos and written journals. The bigger goal is to use this dream data to create dream cartographies, essentially maps of recurring themes, emotions, and symbols—to uncover patterns and insights across dreams over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we've built the video generation and dream journaling features. The app is live on TestFlight, and we're preparing a major update soon that includes a new better UI, and dream questionnaire to help with pattern recognition and dream mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear thoughts, feedback, or connect with others working on similar intersections of tech and the mind! If you're interested in trying it out, you can find the TestFlight link on our website: https://visirya.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is nice, but I wonder if a generated video can have any resemblance of the actual dream. At least for me, dreams are very tied to emotion, and the visuals are kinda blurry, so i don’t know if that sort of thing can provide any satisfaction. But I know certain aesthetics can feel “dreamlike”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Super cool! I'm building in the same space but for Muslims - Dreamstate: Interpret your dreams Islamically https://dreamstateai.replit.app/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried your app - it's quite abrupt to go straight to Access Microphone permissions. The voice recording took a long time to analyse, it timed out for me. It's a great idea but didn't work for me unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a webapp for critically think with others about a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that you build a diagram that contains all the details about the problem and people's thoughts on it, and it's organized in such a way that it's easy to just keep refining, down to the smallest detail. So you build this concrete, shared understanding, and move it forward and forward, until hopefully y'all can make some best decision to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot to do. Currently working on UX to allow hiding intermediate nodes and still have indirect edges drawn. Want to add an LLM integration to generate/update diagrams via natural language, which I think will help a lot with usage barriers to using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted something similar for a worldview. I want an app where I can dump all the things that actively go into shaping my worldview and then when someone wants to know why I think the way I do, I will share them the link of my worldview board. We are not famous people to have our memoir written but this is another way to peek into minds of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a cool idea. Seems like there would be a ton of things contained in an individual's worldview, that it'd be hard to build all of it up. Perhaps when you encounter something that makes you think of some core philosophy, you note it and the philosophy, and eventually there would be a loose picture that forms amongst all the relations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certainly would be helpful for trying to understand someone else. Not sure if this is totally appropriate, but it does seem like something that a chatbot would be good at combing through to find examples to suggest why one thinks a certain way about a new topic. You could even ask it about your own worldview!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building an iOS app for metronome sequencing to get faster at playing guitar and reaching "shred" speeds at different subdivisions/time signatures in a single sequence. Planning on adding accuracy indicators and scoring so rushing or dragging can be easily identified when finishing a saved routine. I.e., some post-routine metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been playing guitar for a little under 6 years and ran into the common problem among many intermediate guitarists fall into, which is stagnating into a plateau at a certain BPM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most effective solution I've found is to take the top speed hit playing a chunk of a lick and simply increase it 20-50 BPM past that limit, attempting one's best to stay in tempo. Regardless of how sloppy it sounds. Then roughly halve that increased addition of BPM, it will become relatively easier to play. For example, if you are stuck at 120 BPM, upping it to 150 BPM with sloppy attempts, then dropping it back down to 130-140 BPM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've gone cleanly from alternate picked 140 BPM triplets to 220 BPM triplets in two months after being stuck at 140 BPM for over a year with this method. Sometimes even hitting 280 BPM triplets when I have the focus and time for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even then, I want a more consistent, and variable way of customizing a practice session using a metronome from a hobbyist perspective without using a DAW. With a simpler interface for doing so. As well as encourage with said method above for other guitarists in the pursuit of speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great instructional video. First place I learned E natural minor with his scale fragments section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, not a new technique by any stretch of the means. AFAIK John Petrucci takes a less aggressive approach with raising BPM. Funnily, Shawn Lane goes into a very similar methodology &amp;gt;30 years ago[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least a couple more weeks. Hopefully less than a month out from now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have most of the UI done for sequencing. Workflows for speed building and metronome sequencing will be completely free, which is also a top priority for me to get out the door first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Typegres, a new data layer for the modern stack (TypeScript + PostgreSQL).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My take is that for years, ORMs have hidden the power of PostgreSQL behind generic, database-agnostic abstractions. This made sense in 2010, but now it's a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typegres rejects this. It's a "translator, not an abstraction," designed to express the full power of PostgreSQL (all statements, built-in functions, etc.) in a type-safe TypeScript API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest killer feature my take of "object-relational mapping done right": class-based models with methods that are actually composable SQL expressions. This lets you extend your tables with expressive logic and fully-composable relations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Https://KushtyBuckRecords.com Been thinking a lot about tools for modern musicians/artists/producers. Not tools for creating the music but tools for communication. Email subscriber lists, event creation (image and text) combined with ability to generate QR codes and send them with easy to use dashboard, some kind of insights into the QR scans, merchandise (integrations with Shopify), hn style link aggregation around music.. been building it with my son who also becomes my product manager since he the one using the tools. For now a private repo consisting of a rails API and a react TS frontend app. Everyday I come up with some small improvements in my head but alas not enough time in the world. With the day job an all, this is purely a passion project and a way to help my son follow his passion, putting on house music events and DJ/producing. If anyone interested, plz reach out contact@kushtybuckrecords.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building https://resolver.one - a DNS server that returns GeoIP data as TXT records. Query an IP directly as the hostname (e.g. dig TXT 8.8.8.8.rslvr.one) and get back country, ASN, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always been fascinated by repurposing established protocols for unintended uses - DNS is everywhere, passes through firewalls, and has built-in caching. Seemed like a fun way to deliver location data without HTTP APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Super niche, definitely a bit odd, but that's the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data source is IPinfo Lite MMDB file, which seems to be offered freely without restrictions. I'd love to offer comprehensive GeoIP attributes but I'm afraid to even ask how much the DB download of that costs... I'm working on supporting new data sets now like security CVEs, shodan integration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building LookAway[1] - an antidote to seductive screens. Many people have been facing issues like eye strain, digital fatigue, CVS, posture issues, and more due to prolonged screen use and I aim to solve it with this product. I believe managing screen time is as important as managing sleep (if not more).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://finbodhi.com — It helps you track, understand, and plan your personal finances — with a proper accounting foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a double-entry personal finance tool where you own your data. It’s local-first, syncs across devices, and everything’s encrypted in transit. Soon with multi-currency support. Currently targeted for desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's interesting in many way. Using double-entry (it's a perspective shift and a power tool), the challenges and advantages of building local-first app, UI/UX &amp;amp; visualizations, privacy and more. For personal apps, local-first is a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solo-building this project for some time, going to launch the first version in a week or so!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://elmo.dev - a tool that automatically builds a searchable knowledge base around your project based on your conversation with coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works automatically and doesn't require your attention. To build KB it uses same tool as you (claude/codex/gemini) so it uses the same quota and you don't have to pay additionally for the AI running it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is ./elmodocs directory in the root of your project. You can reference CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md to this directory or directly include the whole directory or its parts into the coding context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very close to releasing V3 of my Obsidian template vault with huge improvements, first class AI support, included Bases, a solid productivity system, and a ton more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Release engineering for FreeBSD 15.0-RELEASE. Major releases are always a lot of work, but this is probably the biggest release in 20 years due to the new base system distribution system landing. (We're switching from "here's a tarball containing everything" to "here's 500 packages", with resulting changes in the build process, download/update mirrors, installer, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that this is a major release, there are fairly wide error bars on that; it could be as much as 3 weeks earlier if the first release candidate turns out to be perfect, and of course it could be later if things go badly (but I very much hope to get it out by the end of 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitely a massive job. Some FreeBSD developers have stepped up to volunteer tremendous amounts of help (and also the FreeBSD Foundation has paid staff helping out with parts of this) but my best guess is that I'll be spending around 300 unpaid hours making this release happen; I've been doing pretty much full time hours on this in September and I'm really hoping that once pkgbase moves from "need to implement the stuff which isn't implemented yet" to "need to iron out some bugs" I'll have time for other things... like my paid job, Tarsnap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently released JazzEar, an iOS app for ear training. Specifically focuses on improving recognition of chord progressions you would hear in jazz standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I'm working on a smaller app for jazz musicians to manage their tune list and act as a tool to help practice and review tunes. I wanted this app to tell me what tunes on my list I haven't played in a while (and might forget), or try different keys or exercises on the tune and track what I found difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building an app to help people memorize Kanji by turning the characters into vivid, memorable images with accompanying mnemonic stories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think AI image and video models have reached a point where they can offer a completely new approach to language learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I'm planning to add features that use AI to generate comic strips (using Seedream or Nano Banana), songs (using Suno) and videos (using Veo 3 or Seedance) to make learning Kanji even more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the side, custom coloring books for kids using nano banana, started with a project for my son, and its a little janky for some photos but have had some interest already: https://bespokebooks.io. I think it needs to be a phone app to really work for most people though, so that's next on my to do list besides some prompt tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there are a lot of really fun projects possible now in the child book creation space, particularly as you build tools that they can use themselves (like adding voice interfaces to building a book or story).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is outside my 996 job of AI Agent/Assistant infra + ops :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every two months there’s a 15-day tournament where 670 rikishi(sumo wrestler) fighting ~160 matches each day. I’m recording all the results and kimarite (winning moves) into a browsable database with charts and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I have been using Gemini to process and edit the daily match videos. It works surprising well. It can detect the start/end of each bout, recognise the wrestlers and assign the correct rikishi id to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still early, but if you want to get into Sumo feel free to join! Its fun to watch and the matches are quick!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sumo fan here, this is cool. UI is great. I assume you know about sumodb? I don't say that to discourage you, but people are tracking stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since you are good at UI, here's something I would really like: a Natto-style page for each bout that I can manually page through as I watch the basho. Since Natto is underground, I have to watch the basho on NHK or Abema or via Kintamayama - all fine, but I miss the Natto graphics. If you could do that in a way that I could tap through each match, I'd use it every day of the basho and I think so would everyone on r/sumo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BTW if you don't know what I'm talking about, reach out and I will explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was testing something like this with https://sumostats.com/live (a second-screen style page, so you can quickly look up the current match and it follows along live).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think I know what you mean... I'll check out Natto graphics again (haven't seen it in a while) and will try make something up for next basho!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started a company to grow unlimited eggs from stem cells, based on the work from my recent PhD. This will solve nearly all female infertility and help prevent genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you making a joke, or is there some use for that? (I would think of all species on earth, chickens are the easiest to get eggs for once you exclude the insects, but lack of domain knowledge means I could easily be missing something)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very much a hobby, but I'm working on a Pinterest alternative built on ATProto called Scrapboard[1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bluesky ecosystem is a really great platform to build social media on and with Pinterest being overtaken by AI content I figured I'd give it a shot. There is definitely not as much content there, but it is of much higher quality and the culture of providing alt text on images really makes search work rather well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building an app where 1 pushup = 1 minute of scrolling allowed [1]. We've fiiinally started to grow and reached a whooping $30k in the last month!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was literally thinking about quitting in August. My motivation is now at an all-time high - some users have done &amp;gt;8k pushups :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, the key has been the marketing (10M views on Instagram). But we have to improve the product to make people love it even more. So the roadmap is more full than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Active recall studying app that allows a user to practice active recall[0]. The app hides user provided content at first and asking the user to try to remember all they can before reading the content. Then the user goes through the material slowly revealing each paragraph from their input. At the end they try to actively remember what they learned and can even compare to what they knew at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Mixtape sharing platform for midwest emo[1] which is a genre I've really gotten into over the past few years. The community is pretty strong on YouTube for creating "mixtapes" so I wanted a spot that was just for these videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- PhotoForge[2] Photographer's companion app which can help me choose photos using a Tinder-esque swiping mechanism. It also has some AI stuff for generating Instagram descriptions. Finally has a watermark tool. Still trying to think of other stuff to add. This was an AI code weekend project so it's like a house on stilts at the moment but I plan to give it some more love soon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A webscraping / data pipeline to get the .pdf "Explanation of Benefits", "Proof of Coverage", and "Drug Formulary" for every Medicare Advantage plan in the USA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These docs are gonna be used in a product for medicare brokers (if you are/know one please reach out open enrollment starts Nov.1!), and the pipeline is horizontally scalable to ingest updated 2026 plans overnight @ start of open enrollment (though some companies are posting updated plans earlier)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some clever tricks at play but mostly it's bog-standard browser automation; I'm also in an interview process with 2 entities (one funded startup and one massive corporation) talking about web automation roles, and while it's frustrating that they're moving so slowly it's working out to give me time to build this well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I pride myself on being pretty well organized with my digital life, especially files and folders. I’ve been using Hazel (God Knows, since it's beta). Recently, I realized it has become a muscle memory for me to name/rename files, and drop them where they belong while I'm working on or as it happens. This works for me now because I have a weekly routine of digital chores that picks up any slack and missing things that I missed during my days. Compound this with the fact that I have reduced a lot of clutter, minimized things that I’m involved in. That worked. I did away with Hazel since the beginning of 2025 and I didn’t missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I’ve been sheepishly and shamefully looking at either an AI-assisted solution to even do away with the last mile cleanups and organization that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your text above is good enough marketing for me, and your website’s content sealed it. Didn’t even look further. I’m your customer now. And, personally, have always loved supporting other founders/builders building interesting tools and utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: I just realized this is not compatible with Intel Macs which I wanted to use on too. I didn’t read everything on the website, did I?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suggestion: Please send me an email after successful purchase, so I have a record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be what I've been looking for. On the first of every month I have Hazel put everything in ~/Downloads/yyyy-mm (previous month), with the intent to move each file to the correct project/area folder in my actual file structure. But I'm about 1.5 years behind on that...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you looked at competitors? If so, what are they? I haven't found anything that does this as elegantly as Fallinorg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a fantasy football rankings app using claude code, and it has been blowing up in the fantasy football subreddit. Funny enough, it's forcing Yahoo to change their site and improve their layout which ruined all my automation. Surprised how much traffic it's receiving every week just for a better layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to do a lot of historical review of early AI stuff. Just finished the Semantic Information Processing[1] book edited by Marvin Minsky, and now I'm reading Volume 1 of the Parallel Distributed Processing[2 book by Rumelhart and McClelland. After that, I have Principles of Semantic Networks[3] by John F. Sowa queued up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with all of that, still working on a lot of stuff using Jason[4] / AgentSpeak[5]. I created a fork[6] of Jason that is meant to be easier to integrate with Spring Boot, and to take more of a "run headless on a server" approach, which meant taking out references to a Swing based in-process logging/management tool. In place of that, I'm implementing a JMX based management interface, and recently I've started to work on replacing the old Swing app with a JavaFX app that can connect using JMX Remoting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's funny you say that. I already do run a weekly "book club" group, but it's at work at my $dayjob employer. And, for various reasons, we've drifted away from the book focus and turned into a more presentation/discussion oriented group. But I still love to read physical books, and wouldn't be opposed to trying to come up with something to structure some discussion around some of these "outside of work" readings that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want, drop me and email (prhodes@fogbeam.com) and maybe we can set something up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to build https://crucialexams.com/, a platform that helps people prepare for IT certifications like CompTIA, AWS, and Microsoft/Azure. It offers realistic practice tests and study tools. I also have partnered with educators and universities who now offer it to their students and get dashboards to review student progress and identify where they are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an audiobook service (currently for myself) that will fill in major missing features for platforms like Audible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Ignore AI voiced books&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Show me unread books in series that I have in my library&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Experimenting with better search. I have experience with building semantic search systems and have been highly disappointed with Audible's extremely sub-par search capabilities. I want results that are actually based on books, authors, and narrators that I have already purchased, read, or listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Get automatic notifications when new books from authors and narrators that I subscribe to become available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's at least a few more gripes I want to address, but these are the high priority ones that come to mind right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest issue these days, is that after spending 1000 hours messing around in eleven labs, almost all female american audiobook narrators sound AI generated to me. I feel like as a demographic they must have sold a lot of voice recordings to the platform for analysis. I have DNR'ed a few audiobooks recently due to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Macscope (https://macscope.app), a better Cmd+Tab for macOS. I built it because macOS window management feels slow compared to the keyboard-driven speed of a terminal or code editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It augments your existing muscle memory: a quick tap of a shortcut switches apps like normal, but holding it opens a powerful interface with features like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unified Search: Instantly find any window, app, or browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scopes: Save and restore entire window layouts for different projects (perfect for after you unplug a monitor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Placement Modes: Snap windows to screen halves as you switch to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to make the OS feel as fast as my other tools. I'm always looking for feedback on how to make window management less frustrating!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as a solution to LLM front ends having terrible native branching features. But slowly I realize most of our data will be going through LLM's so Yggdrasil is evolving into a platform which consumes all your LLM queries, while keeping it easy to query and reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now I have begun to realize how detrimental LLM assisted coding can be to someone who starts depending on it too much, so Yggdrasil is a bet in the other direction as compared to mainstream. Instead of agents/AI doing everything I believe human + ai assistance will win in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yggdrasil has a simple agent called Valkyrie, so they have their place, but that I believe should be the last step, after the developer has discussed and planned thoroughly through our tree interface, Heimdall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if someone replaces the dev, they can browse their conversations with the LLM, observe their mind map, what questions they asked, what extra things they considered (branches), the whole thought process easily navigable and visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally after using Yggdrasil, I feel quite confident in using the LLM, as I can ask all the silly questions I want, without worrying about context pollution. It aligns really well with the natural exploratory tangential thoughts we have when trying to find solutions or learn something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm finally organising 20 years of voice notes. Some were quite outdated - I probably no longer need the mozzarella cheese I reminded myself to buy in early 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To organize them, I'm writing a Python Qt application with Claude Code. It started off as vibe coding, but I'm now developing it using processes very similar to those I would use when managing software teams. I've picked up a lot of good tips about that here on HN. I've got Whisper, and fallback online services, transcribing the audio and summarizing it and adding tags. After much UI experimentation, I've landed on something that looks not unlike an email client, with tags in the left pane, a center pane which lists transcriptions and notes about each audio file, and a right pane with more detailed information about the selected audio file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next step is to serve it all as a model context protocol server - I need to pick an agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fluxmail is an AI-powered email app that helps you get done with email faster. I think there's a significant opportunity for AI to change the way we use email, and I'm experimenting with ways to improve the status quo. I'd love to hear what features you'd like to see in such an app!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a job board for AI jobs and companies. The job market in AI is pretty hot right now, and there are a lot of cool AI companies out there. I'm hoping to connect job seekers with fast-growing AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on FastFileLink (https://fastfilelink.com/), yet another file-sharing CLI/app that uses WebRTC for P2P transfer but exposes HTTPS links, making it compatible with browsers and tools like curl/wget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's ~90% production-ready. We use it internally to move files between containers and hosts (especially when volumes aren't mounted), and for WFH employees to exchange large files without a relay server. For huge files, there's resumable upload to our infra-backed server — fast global downloads included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CLI will also support receiving files via WebRTC, but that feature hasn't been released yet. It is open source (https://github.com/nuwainfo/ffl), but the README hasn't been updated yet and the code is not synced with the latest version (working on these).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another production-used tool I'm working on is MailTrigger (https://www.mailtrigger.net/) — a programmable SMTP server that turns any email into a message on LINE, Slack, Teams, Telegram, SMS, or basically anything. If your app can send email, it can trigger multi-channel notifications with zero extra code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it as “SMTP to Anything,” or an email-native IFTTT/Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports JS and WASM for preprocessing, routing, and automation — you can write custom logic, auto-reply with LLM-generated messages, or forward alerts intelligently. We use it for price drop alerts, server health monitoring, and integrations with Jenkins/Sentry to push incidents to our DevOps Telegram channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also experimenting with LLM-assisted rule creation: you can define notification logic in natural language instead of writing code — for example, auto-reply with an LLM-generated joke or handle customer support queries dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docs are more complete than the website (which is still evolving), and the pricing page is currently a placeholder. Already running in production for us and a few early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m solo-coding the clear commercial project smmdealfinder.com which is not ground-breaking or amazing as these other great projects here, but its been an amazing journey for me personally for the last 18 months and has developed me probably from a junior engineer to senior+/staff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whilst I’m recently really critical of most AI posts here, this wouldn’t have been possible without AI, but mainly because AI could feed my curiosity and barely any riddle was unsolvable, when I put it into pieces and combined it with debugging (and checking docs). Actually most riddles on my level weren’t unsolvable before, but AI reduced the friction and speed of learning for me. This actually goes beyond coding. In life I just ask and learn a lot about, washing, cooking and domain-specific terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Listening Facts[0], a music habits visualization tool based on your top tracks. Inspired by Receiptify and every day nutrition facts labels[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started out as a Spotify oriented project but due to their recent API changes[2] I ended up focusing more on a Last FM integration. This wasn't that bad as their API provides more details such as play count per song. I've also added an Apple Music integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted about it[3] on Last FM's subreddit and I was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of people shared their labels on the comments and seemed to like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on language detection, I think it'd be cool to get a language breakdown of the songs you listen to and for that to be part of the displayed items within the label. Something along the lines of EN- 80%, ES- 15%, FR - 5%&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also tried getting Adsense on the website but I keep getting denied on "Low Content Value" grounds. I tried some alternatives but the quality of their ads was ridiculous (stuff like "your device has a virus, click here to clean it up")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a personal recruiter / talent agent for my smartest dev/product/design friends (and theirs) https://www.hedgy.works&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key problems we're solving:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Everyone wants to be doing meaningful, fun work that feels like their "life's work". Few feel like they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- In recruiting, the AI spam problem is real and only getting worse, essentially killing the cold application pipeline. You need a referral.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Optimizing your career feels like annoying politicking for a lot of the most talented folks who just want to focus on building cool stuff. But, as an employee, if you don't test the market (e.g. take a recruiter conversation) from time to time, your comp can really stagnate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that Deus Ex remaster fiasco, I wanted to see how the famous Unreal 1 dithering technique would look on Quake's software renderer. Getting a clean build of it on Linux was fun in itself: https://github.com/klaussilveira/exp-quake&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a tool called Materia[0] for managing Podman Quadlets on hosts, GitOps style and I think it's really starting to hit its stride. I just released a new version yesterday: https://github.com/stryan/materia/releases/tag/v0.3.0 .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's been a couple attempts in this space before but they usually seem to peter out after a while. I'm hoping to avoid that by staying flexible and focusing on just managing files instead of creating a new compose-like DSL. But even if it doesn't become popular I'm just happy I don't have to manage my homelab with Ansible anymore :) .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on https://www.hessra.net/, an identity + authorization service built around [Biscuits](https://www.biscuitsec.org/) instead of JWTs. The goal is to decompose auth primitives so they’re easier to use in service-to-service cases, while also showing off what Biscuit tokens make possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JWTs feel like problems waiting to happen. I think biscuits give stronger guarantees and are harder to get wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One piece I’ve shipped is an identity token that can be delegated offline. For example, “company:alice” can delegate to “company:alice:agent,” and that token can then be used to request an authorization token. This makes for a neat API key model: you can issue a simple opaque identity token to your customer (e.g. “customer123”) without having to maintain a DB of hashes/expirations, since those are encoded into the token. Later, you can upgrade security by exchanging the identity token for an authorization token, or let customers delegate access (e.g. “customer123:marketing”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also been experimenting with higher-order authorization flows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Service chains: each step in a request’s path (edge → app → DB) can add attestations, so later services can validate the full chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Multi-party authorization: requiring two independent services/orgs to co-sign an authorization token, useful for cross-org or on-prem deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I’m building an OAuth 2.1 profile where the identity token replaces a refresh token and the authorization token stands in for the access token. I’m especially interested in hearing where people find OAuth clunky in practice, or stories from folks who’ve built auth systems with other token types (macaroons, biscuits, etc.) or for use cases where OAuth didn’t fit well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biscuits are in the same family as macaroons in that they are bearer tokens that can be attenuated offline, but they go further. A biscuit carries a chain of signed “blocks” that can contain facts, rules, and checks in a small Datalog-like logic language. That lets the token itself express richer authorization context, not just restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key differences from macaroons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Crypto model: Macaroons use HMAC, so every verifier needs the shared secret. Biscuits use public/private keypairs so any verifier with the public key can check validity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Expressiveness: Macaroons only add caveats (restrictions). Biscuits can encode facts, rules, and checks, enabling more complex policies to travel with the token. so you can attest and attenuate (and do some other tricky stuff if you want)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Delegation: Both support attenuation, but biscuits do it with signed blocks that are verifiable and can be chained across services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So conceptually similar, but biscuits aim to be more decentralized and policy-rich.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on exploring an exploit in physical security systems that I haven't seen anyone investigate before (at least, not published on the internet). It's involved an interesting combination of reverse engineering, pentesting and regular prototyping/hardware development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently writing a run-through of it to publish on my website. I'm not sure how secretive to be - I think I just want to be the first to actually release my findings. In my post I'll detail the steps to reproduce my results so more people can look into this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I haven't found any critical ways to (ab)use this access control system weakness, as it only typically applies to the outer layer of physical security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm actually in the middle of a complete redesign of the AI layer, but there is a POC video linked from the GitHub README that demonstrates the interaction I'm going for using an earlier version. The POS is a very bare-bones system where the "kernel," as it were, is implemented in Rust. There's an MCP atop that to allow the AI and UI layers to drive the POS. Stores may be implemented as extensions that plug into the POS kernel, and that's where language, currency, item databases, and such are defined. The AI cashier knows what items are for sale, how to modify items (in a restaurant context), how to translate from other languages, how to interpret what the customer actually wants, and seamlessly lead the customer through a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current code is quite ugly and full of a lot of unfortunate hacks, but it was a good education. The new design puts the AI much more in charge, without as much code-level orchestration. I'm applying a lot of my knowledge from the retail POS and self-service checkout domains to this, as well as learning a lot about applying AI to a "legacy" software domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks like Markdown is having a bit of a heyday with it being the default mode of docs for AI coders. And it became apparent that there is no simple, but powerful Markdown viewer for the Mac, so I made one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports all the usual Markdown formatting but also diagrams and equations so you can get Claude to not only write up your system docs but also supply a diagram of the database structure, logic, or AWS services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be cool if you gave it a go :-) It is in the Mac app store "ViewMD"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are building an operating system for making sustainability compliance trivial. Currently we are using a combination of modern AI agents and traditional methods. If you are a hyperscaler or in a heavy industry or just need support for dealing with e.g. California's SB 253 and SB 261, shoot me a message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focusing on ergonomics improvements. Just released an improvement to the __repr__ for Invalid types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potentially working on expanding the ability to generate validators from arbitrary typehints, ie `get_typehint_validator(list[str | int])`. It has good coverage, but I suspect I'm blind to some obvious holes. Would love feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not the core of koda-validate, and yeah lots of libraries have a similar capacity. Feedback I'd be interested in is if there are gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general the value prop of koda-validate is that it turns validation into typesafe building blocks, which makes validators very re-usable -- and flexible. Some other notable differences from pydantic are that it doesn't `raise` on validation errors, you don't need a typing plugin, and it's fully asyncio-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently it mainly focuses on libGDX which is my most favorite framework. I prefer code-centric approach because that's how game development should be in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the tutorials are just pure coding with algorithms explanations. My goal is to build one of the most resourceful website for libGDX because it's quite underserved at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the future I may expand to other code-centric frameworks and more general game development topics, let's see how it go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typing is an extremely underrated skill and especially in the age of LLMs, it is the bottle neck in a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve never been fond of existing typing apps; excessive ads, typing random words, etc so I built my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can practice typing code, use your own text, etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a paid plan for features where you can type natural text that targets your weak points (via SmartPractice) and many others. Other than that, it’s both free to use (and ad-free)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clicking items in the tensors explains where they came from and where they are used in the output. The input tensors can be modified too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a one-man side project that's been half building the site framework, and half re-implementing pytorch functions in javascript. Plenty more functions to go, but hopefully people can already find it useful. I'm planning on doing a Show HN once I've added ~10 more functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posting this from a throwaway account because my main account is locked due to `noprocrast`!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been contributing to a project called Folk computer[1]. It's focused on creating a physical medium for computing (think printing out a program, which is then tracked by the computer. There's some really cool spatial interaction that happens). Folk v2 is currently in development, so I've been digging into the guts of the datalog-like engine. It's been a lot of fun to pick up C and see it applied to a project I can directly interact with!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm rebuilding OnlineOrNot's frontend to be powered by the public REST API. Doing this both as a means of dogfooding, and adding features to the REST API, that I easily dumped into the private GraphQL API without thinking too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically I've realised GraphQL has taken me as far as it can, and I should've gone with REST to start with. That, and after I finish the first milestone (uptime checks + cron job monitors), I'll be able to start building a proper terraform provider, and audit logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a daily word puzzle game with a twist!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Tiled Words you rearrange tiles to solve clues and rebuild a broken crossword.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can play a demo at https://tiledwords.com - it’s free and web based so it works on whatever device you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll be officially launching on October 19th at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo. You can sign up to be notified on launch. Starting then there will be a new puzzle every day!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I’ve gotten really positive feedback and have around 100 people signed up to get notified. It’s been a lot of fun to build!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cool idea. One suggestion is to allow a selection box to be dragged around a block of letters. Once selected, all of the tiles in the area could be dragged at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would reduce the frustration of having to move a large chunk of words around piece by piece. It would be better than the existing affordance, which moves the whole grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to re-legalize "neighborhood commercial" by right in the city I live in. Things like corner stores or small barber shops or coffee shops or converted restaurants. ACUs or Accessory Commercial Units, home conversions... different ways of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great. I assume you live in the US ? Your urban planning law are atrocious. In countries like thailand for instance it's very common to have a shop in the house. Things go nicely and it's more lively. Good luck, that a good project at the root of so many issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a shop in a house in Thailand and a crazy person decides he likes the shop and stays in front of it all day yelling, in Thailand, the people in the house call the police, who make the crazy person leave. In the US, every person, crazy or not, has Freedoms and Rights, and the police won't do anything to help the people in the house because it would be wrong according the the US way of thinking to curtail the Rights and Freedoms of the crazy person (who is yelling all day near the shop, which is very near the house).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, owners of houses in the US try to make it as boring as possible and as useless as possible for any crazy person, homeless person or group of teenagers to hang around near the house. One way they do this is to make sure the house is surrounded only by other houses, trees, parking spaces and roads (and there is not anything as useful or interesting as a shop in easy walking distance).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a bit of an exaggeration, but it is directionally accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it's mostly just car-brain where people think that cities should be designed around cars cars and cars, and then if there's room left over, maybe some shops and homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So they worry about a neighborhood shop taking up the precious, precious parking spots or causing 'traffic!' even if in reality it reduces it because people have something close by their home they could even walk or bike to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the root problem is not the American commitment to rights and freedoms (especially for the disadvantaged) that Americans discuss constantly -- often in heated, emotional or abstract terms and sometimes in frankly ideological terms. According to you the root problem is an irrational and destructive commitment to automobiles, which (at least after the 1960s) Americans talk about much less than they talk about rights and freedoms -- and when they talk about them, they talk mostly in pragmatic terms, e.g., miles per gallon, turning radius, maintenance costs and space for car seats for children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in a city of 100K people, where there really aren't that many visible people with mental health issues or drug problems. I also go to a lot of city council meetings and hearings and observe local social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on cataloging a curated list of craft beer venues across the world at https://wheretodrink.beer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsure what the plan is going forward with it, apart from adding more venues and more countries. As long as it's fun for me I'll just keep adding things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next addition will be to add health inspection data from countries that have that in open datasets or APIs, so if anyone know of that I'd be appreciative of hints (know of UK, Norway and might have found for France).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of our jobs consist of working with tools. Yet it’s very hard to get insights into which tools are required most, are growing in your area, etc. So I decided to keep track of tools and technologies mentioned in the data space by keeping track of job openings for the last two years. Now I’ve opened up that data set. Here’s an analysis for jobs per data warehouse: https://selectfrom.work/insights/data_warehouses&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just upload a picture and pick a design type and it generates a thumbnail for you. Got good feedback last time I posted, steadily and slowly growing now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly organizing my dotfiles across Windows, macOS, Linux and BSD, however, I have really fallen for Ansible. I discovered at work awhile back, but was able to grok how to make and run a playbook, and I've been hooked since. It also finally allowed me to click the difference between Imperative and Declarative programming!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a partition-oriented declarative data build system. The inspiration comes from working with systems like Airflow and AWS step functions, where data orchestration is described explicitly, and the dependency relationships between input and produced data partitions is complex. Put simply, writing orchestration code for this case sucks - the goal of the project is to enable whole data platforms to be made up of jobs that declare their input and output partition deps, so that they can be automatically fulfilled, enabling kubernetes-like continuous reconciliation of desired partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means, instead of the answer to "how do we produce this output data" being "trigger and pray everything upstream is still working", we can answer with "the system was asked to produce this output data partition and its dependencies were automatically built for it". My hope is that this allows the interface with the system to instead be continuously telling it what partitions we want to exist, and letting it figure out the rest, instead of the byzantine DAGs that get built in airflow/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comes out of a big feeling that even more recent orchestrators like Prefect, Dagster, etc are still solving the wrong problem, and not internalizing the right complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very much agree that to this is the direction data orchestration platforms should go towards - the basic DAG creation can be straightforward, depending on how you do the authoring - (parsing SQL is always the wrong answer, but is tempting) - but backfills, code updates, etc are when it starts to get spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a few utility libraries to make it easier to develop web services, basically exporting packages that I find myself using or rewriting often and exporting them as their own modules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on https://github.com/hxtk/aip as a collection of libraries giving safe default choices to implement Google’s API improvement proposals in ConnectRPC services. It borrows (with attribution per the license) an unexported implementation of AUP-160 filters from the LuCI project, and I intend to expand it to support data sources other than SQL databases and page tokens, and it also exports an implementation of AIP-161 field masks (which have different semantics compared to standard field masks) and middleware to help with using them for AIP-157 read filtering. I intend to export more middleware that I use frequently, but I don’t know if it’ll live in this module or its own yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An open-source protein/molecule viewer, molecular dynamics sim, and general structural biology toolkit, written in Rust. And an ecosystem of libraries to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm putting a bunch of security tools / data feeds together as a service. The goal is to help teams and individuals run scans/analysis/security project management for "freemium" (certain number of scans/projects for free each month, haven't locked in on how it'll pan out fully $$ wise).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to help lower the technical hurdles to running and maintaining security tools for teams and individuals. There are a ton of great open source tools out there, most people either don't know or don't have the time to do a technical deep dive into each. So I'm adding utilities and tools by the day to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, there's a built in expert platform for you to get help on your security problems built into the system. (Currently an expert team consisting of [me]). Longer term, I'm working on some AI plugins to help alert on CVEs custom to you, generate automated scans, and some other fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a text editor inspired by ed, but instead of editing files on disk, it edits live network flows. In this model, files don’t exist as static objects—they exist in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating a file generates a self-sustaining pattern of packets circulating through the network, and editing it changes the flow itself. Multiple users can edit the same file simultaneously, because the file isn’t tied to any machine—it’s in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interface is familiar if you’ve used ed, with commands like append, delete, and substitute, but behind the scenes it’s all live traffic. You can even discover existing flows and jump into them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a Linux proof-of-concept using raw sockets, and the goal is to explore what files could be if we thought of them as living, circulating processes rather than static storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also working on DailySelfTrack ( https://dailyselftrack.com/ ), an app to track what matters to you in a way that you find relevant. So it is a mix of habit tracker, health log and journal. Like a spreadhsheet app, but with much better UX. And like a habit/health app, but with much greater customization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want this to be a tool highly useful for people who have complex health issues, are working towards ambitious goals, or just want to regularly reflect on their day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building it since I couldn't find a satisfying solution anywhere. It's local first and does not force you into a subscription, or tries to exploit you with any other dark patterns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have made a Bürgeramt appointment finder. It was down for a few weeks after the city of Berlin changed its anti-bot measures. I just released an updated version that works again: https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/appointment-finder&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My citizenship wait times page (https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/citizenship-wait-times) has also gotten enough feedback to be useful since its release last month. I'd like to make it more useful with better visualisations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I'm working on another iteration of my health insurance calculator (https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/health-insurance-calculator). It's kind of a big deal both because it's a huge financial decision for recent immigrants, and because it funds a big chunk of all the free stuff I'm putting out. This is especially important with ChatGPT and AI summaries halving my traffic. This iteration will recommend health insurance combinations that work for a visa application and for a long-term stay in Germany. It will provide far better explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I'm testing a new insurance broker with far shorter response times, so people can directly ask an expert to help them choose. They're reachable via Whatsapp, and that made a huge difference in how people get advice. It worked so well that I want to do the same for other topics. I'm already talking with an immigration lawyer who's interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I joined two current interests, my need to learn better JavaScript (since I never used it much) and the discovery of programs like PICO-8. I realize TIC-80 is basically the same but allows me to use other languages, so I’m trying to write small games using JS. I’m still on the struggle phase, trying to learn how to make sound effects, music etc. but I like the fact it comes with everything you need to create whatever you want. Also like how it makes you forget about all the giant software complexity nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to build a next gen quickbooks competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something that doesn't nickle and dime you, very cheap (perhaps even open source), has all of the extensibility of a modern ERP, a great UI, and handles complex use cases (revenue rec, expense management, inventory cogs, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like this is solving a real problem, but have no idea how to break into the industry. Just trying to solve my own problems for business accounting but would be nice to know other folks would be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I might be taking a contracted job to help provide AI/ML guidance for a friend's company here soon, but all I really do is use ChatGPT/Claude Code a lot and don't really have explicit AI/ML tool building experience. They know this and mostly just want me for competency and comfort going from 0-1 with a new project, but I'm still pretty nervous! So I'm trying to conjure up some simple ideas to inspire me to learn :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently trying to predict student absenteeism in the future based on historical indicators with synthetic data using basic ML modeling and then using LLMs to generate helpful guidance for relevant parties. Basically letting parents know there's concern and citing leading indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure what I'll do next, but hoping to come up with a few other ideas to put my mind at ease. It's fun having some actual motivation to keep up with the current hype instead of just being a consumer, though!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am launching (tomorrow) a service that helps builders and businesses fix their vibe coded apps and get them production-ready and integrated into their organization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been making and selling my electronic social battery pin badges for a while now (https://hortus.dev/products/social-battery) and I'm expanding the range with seasonal versions like a Christmas mood badge, and a halloween themed ghost badge that's coming soon. I'm lucky enough that these projects have gone down well and are making enough money to fund some more complicated (and expensive) projects that I wouldn't have otherwise had the guts to try. Currently I'm working on an RGB digital sand timer with customizable timing sequences so that you can use it for things like the pomodoro technique - I have a working prototype and at the moment I'm experimenting with interfaces for setting the sequences. I wanted to use a combination of buttons and an accelerometer for this but it's not as intuitive as I'd like so I may end up making a small smartphone app to configure it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on Danger World (https://danger.world), my casual 2D narrative adventure with turn-based RPG elements. Built in Flame, on top of Flutter for iOS, Android, Windows and MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're getting close! It's just a matter of polishing and polishing and polishing, but I'm really excited about how close we are to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was "choker" back in the day, which I actually never heard about since I wasn't into chess back then. But (1) there was no web version, and (2) it had a specific gameplay that seems too slow for my taste. My version is highly customizable on the setup/rounds/rules, too. From my research, the original was also overrun by bots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking up choker online I found this reddit thread:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It’s a cool concept, but terrible app design and it’s all just bots you connect with, making it terribly easy to win almost every game&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sounds like this game needs a better AI opponent then? I don’t know anything about this game but something that learned from your gameplay and figured out how to beat you would be very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I already have a better chess engine at different skill levels for 1-player mode. For two human players, I plan to start with sending a link to a friend given there won't be enough random players on the website to find one in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I proved the infinitude of primes, which I was pretty happy with. https://www.philipzucker.com/knuckle_primes/ A trivial theorem in the scheme of things, but one for which z3 certainly can't do it on it's own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on https://theretowhere.com, which is a website that makes it easier to find apartments and hotels/airbnbs close to people and activities you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The past couple months have been fun since I've implemented a lot of new highly-requested features into the site's city heatmapping capabilities. One thing I've found motivating is having my own private changelog that shows screenshots of feature requests people have given me, and then dates for when I finally finished those features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easy to forget how much stuff you've built in a month or two, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibescape: an immersive meditation app. This one is currently featured at the top of the App Store, yay! Launched as a day one app on Vision Pro, new update has what I think is the best immersive environment I've made yet that comes alive with music: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vibescape/id6476827678&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made my pops a walnut multi-guitar stand a couple months ago and I’d like to get some nice pics done and make one of those eCommerce web site things to sell them. Here's a bad pic https://bradlyfeeley.com/onokura.jpg&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing jig for a traction control system for a locomotive. Microcontroller connected to a DDS waveform generator simulates the sensor that picks wheel speed, various ADCs and DACs read in analog voltages that are compared to determine loss of traction. 1980s analog computing at its finest. If I had a choice I would be doing anything else ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm toying around with a language that's like Python but with Hindley-Miller interference and some functional stuff. It's not a superset or anything, because I can't do that, but it's interesting how well HM (plus some well-encapsulated escape hatches) map onto the Python ecosystem with all its dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on my terminal editor, but I parked that for now -- https://github.com/bloomca/love. It is possible to load a file and edit it, copy/paste works, you can select text, etc. The next step is to integrate with the tree-sitter for syntax highlighting and then with LSP, but it took a bit more time than I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another project of mine is to play music from my audio CDs by myself. I built a simple Rust library to read TOC and raw PCM data from a CD drive -- https://github.com/Bloomca/rust-cd-da-reader (works on Windows, macOS and Linux), and a ripper -- https://github.com/Bloomca/audio-cd-ripper, which rips all tracks and encodes it as FLAC and fetches metadata from MusicBrainz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step is to play it. I looked into using cpal (https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal), but I feel like using low-level audio API for each platform is a better approach for learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Esperanto havas la mal- prefikso por krei specialcelan antonomion, sed la rezulto ofte mankas klarecon, kaj kiel morfemo mal mem estas morale kondamna: komparu malica, maligna, malversacio kie mal ne estas sinkrone disigebla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tial mi vorkas por krei liston de ĉiuj mal- vortoj kun sen mal- alternativoj. Fakte ĝi ankaŭ povas servi la kontraŭan celon, provizi pli ĝeneralajn mal- vortojn kiam oni deziras krei verkon pli facile akirebla de ĉia nivelo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I left my job to work on my side project (MCP-B: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44515403) full time. I set out with the goal of making the ability to vibecode a webMCP server for your website and inject it via userscript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While building that, I basically wrote a modern version of Tampermonkey with its own marketplace built in. So you can vibe code any userscript and publish it to the marketplace all within the extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The automation stuff is still the core value-prop, but this is a fun bonus feature while I work on solidifying the automation features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm writing a HN post for it. Excited to show everyone in a couple weeks here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone who's curious (I see lots of room for improvement in terminals!), I can't tell what this does from the website, other than the ability to load and view 3d models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MAXSTACK: Web framework for rapidly building SaaS apps with AI - trying to enable the next wave of 'fast-fashion saas'. Think of it like better-auth is doing for auth, I want to do for the rest of SaaS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- comes with common SaaS features pre-built (crud, blog, auth, etc.) - import templates from the framework until you want to customize them - create forms with just a zod schema - good docs, typescript interfaces, a CLI for common tasks, and MCP for your AI agent&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're building something now or want to - I'd love to help. Could use the experience to make things easier through my framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a map that shows which neighborhoods in a city are nice/not nice with a short description.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I visit a new city, just looking at Google Maps is pretty meaningless - it's just a bunch of gray land and streets. I end up looking up Reddit posts for where to go, searching for crime maps, trying to find annotated maps, etc. to get a better idea of where to visit in a city (or even live, like when I had moved to Austin). AI generated scoring and descriptions, while imperfect, have already helped me when visiting SF recently. Early stage, so please help with submitting corrections, if you'd like!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the idea! In my opinion (looking at SF) it’s still too low resolution. SF in particular can vary greatly in safety, walkability, etc. even a few blocks over within a neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very cool! I really like the idea, the way I'd develop this further is by having live crimes reporting on it so that you know which streets to avoid , similar to what waze does where people report items&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obsetico App (named after a friends' comment that "it's great for Obsessed people like my wife"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mobile app to track tasks, events and any info about anything you care about: your car, home, tools, workshop, appliances, pets, lab equipment... anything really.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lets you organize "resources" in a hierarchy (like "folders"). You can then define tasks, add pictures, geolocation, contacts, notes, events, etc to them. Recently added the feature to "share" resources with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on raytraced lighting in the Bevy game engine, using wgpu's new support for hardware raytracing in WGSL. The initial prototype is launching with the release of Bevy 0.17 tomorrow, but there's still a ton left to improve. Lots of experimenting with shaders and different optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working a coding agent, named VT Code. It is a Rust-based terminal coding agent with semantic code understanding powered by tree-sitter and ast-grep, and fully configurable and open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm pursuing my vision of "music-i18n": Open source music software that works for microtonal music and worldwide musical cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not a from-scratch effort, quite the contrary: I'm trying to tie in existing music standards (MIDI, MusicXML, SMuFL, MEI, etc.) and ensure that FOSS systems (MuseScore, Verovio, smaller components) implement enough of those standards to support music-i18n.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, this also includes extending the standards themselves when they are not fully capable of representing some non-mainstream musical aspect. For example, MusicXML lacks the ability of representing multiple accidentals per note (whereas MEI does), which is a must for microtonality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started down this path around 2018, as a music player who got interested in arranging Arabic songs in a "Real Book" style. It opened a giant rabbit hole that I'm still far from having fully explored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now and then, I collaborate with other devs who are interested in adjacent topics. I would love to hear from some of you here!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a product to break down information siloes for private market investors. A lot of data for private equity, private credit, and venture capital firms lives in memos, deal books, conversation notes, emails, and chats. In some cases, attempts to organize that data in a more structured format (e.g. using the CRM) has resulted in data not getting recorded because of the friction of managing those types of systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So basically, I'm building a system where users can query all of that unstructured data and add more with a little less friction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a Heroku / Render / Flyio alternative thats free, open source, built on top of Kubernetes for about 2 years now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found these services charge way too much per GB of memory (10x more than IaaS providers), but more importantly, offer terrible flexibility. You can’t schedule multiple apps on the same instance, and there aren’t many instance size options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Canine also supports deployments of any helm package (postgres, airbyte, dagster, etc) via helm charts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WithAudio a one-time payment, desktop text-to-speech app that helps users read better by highlighting text as it's spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current Challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical: It's difficult to consistently parse text from various document formats. The I also wants to expand to more platforms but I know I need to focus on marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-technical: The product has seen some success with minimal marketing, but I keep getting distracted by spending too much time on technical work. I know I need to do more for marketing but I keep going to my safe space (my IDE).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe in the product but it keeps reminding me how difficult is to get somethig to a polished, finished state for all users. 90% of the project takes 90% of the time and the other 10% takes another 90% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on my Go UI library called gooey [1] which aims to be a one stop framework to build webview/webview apps in Go and WebASM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started out with bindings for the DOM, Web, and Browser APIs, but as of today I now have custom Web Components support (which is a big deal considering Go's type system quirks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I'm gonna polish some of the UI components and start refactoring my git-evac [2] repo management tool which is the first app using the gooey framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Components are bad for web accessibility (aria- property fatigue).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been using web components as a vehicle to automate and auto validate accessibility aspects as much as possible, because I think the only way to truly make things sustainably accessible is to find a way to unburden the developer by either inferring as much as possible or making validation a natural part of development rather than a separate testing cycle that will invariably cause accessibility support to become out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sounds like you might have similar concerns. Do you have any insights to share along these lines for Gooey?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UI components that I wrote initially are just wrappers for the Browser provided input/form elements. As I'm relying on webview/webview to build desktop apps out of it, that also kind of implies WebKitGTK4 on Linux, WebKit on MacOS, and WebView2 (Edge) on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These work quite nicely together with a screen reader because you don't have to intercept the focus event (or others) that people browsing in caret mode or similar would use to navigate the page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally I decided to make single page applications using a main and section[data-view] elements so that the HTML and CSS alone is enough to hint screen readers on what's visible and so that there are no javascript codes necessary to tween things around, the JS/WebASM side of things literally just sets a data-view property on the main element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole idea behind gooey and the way it is structured is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- all states must be serializable in HTML&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Static HTML and CSS makes the page usable (apart from web forms and REST APIs, that's developer provided code)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Dynamic WebASM on top essentially translates the DOM to be interactive, so that things can be animated based on changing data or streams coming from the backend. All interactivity is rendered directly into the DOM, so that it can be serialized again at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Communication between Client and Server is JSON or any other Go implemented Marshaller, and using Fetch API behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided on purpose to not provide XMLHTTPRequest and other old APIs because I'm relying on WebASM and "modern Browser engines" anyways. This way I kinda force users of gooey to use modern JS from the WebASM context and I save a whole lot of trouble with compatibility issues (and don't get into the unsemantic div fatigue like React does, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bindings should also work with tinygo's compiler if you're careful with deadlocks (see docs/ERRATA.md).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haven't tested the typecasting that's required for the components yet though, they might break because of some generics quirks (e.g. Wrap/Unwrap helper methods).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a video platform called Nickel. 5-second clips and 5-minute (max) videos. I've been slacking on development but realized recently that I lack focus and am easily distracted by other projects. I wrote about this yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did figure out something I've long wondered about recently. Y'know how you can see previews of videos in Messages? I got it working! Here's an example video: https://nickel.video/6NI3n_IlIlII&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My inspiration for Nickel was 1) missing Vine and 2) not wanting to use YouTube to share my gaming clips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on a prediction market platform. Although big players like kalshi are pushing this narrative very hard right now i think there is space for a more social focused platform where users can play together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spanara - A word game inspired by the "license plate game" my wife taught me while we lived in Finland. License plates in Finland always start with 3 letters, so out on our walks we'd try to come up with a word quickly, and got more kudos for "good" words. This was a first attempt at a personal project using AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a new mode that is more like what played walking around: a few rounds in rapid fire, very little time to think before the next round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building an LLM powered map for the last 6 months. I'm working to reinvent how mapping applications interact with geocoders and routing engines to make much more powerful and easy to use map applications!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports Claude Code and Codex, but has you constantly working on multiple features in Git worktrees. This way you are always able to stay busy while waiting on your agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has built in tools for review, such as a diff viewer, and a quick button to run your application in different worktrees for testing. It has completely transformed the way I work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a desktop app built with Electron and React. I built to help newlywed couples to quickly sort thousands of wedding photos with a Tinder style swipe UI. It is offline first, fully private, and offers one click export of your selected pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started building it earlier this year after going through my own wedding photo experience and realizing how overwhelming it can be. I saw my wife dragging and dropping photos from one folder to other and thought there has to be a better way for non-photographer folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, I have a working prototype, a landing page live, and I am testing distribution and feedback from early users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, when I use generative AI to produce videos, the results are close to what I envision but rarely capture my imagination exactly. Prompting the AI to fix specific details can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. To address this, I'm developing solutions that make the creative workflow more intuitive. So far, I’ve built an app that allows users to provide visual clues as guides, along with a 3D environment where the camera can be freely manipulated within the generated scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The community is moving fast though. Now higgsfield allows using arrows and pointers to edit the video but so far, no one is doing a good camera control visually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Octelium https://github.com/octelium/octelium a FOSS unified zero trust secure access platform that is flexible enough to operate as a modern zero-config remote access VPN, a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)/BeyondCorp platform, an API/AI/LLM gateway, an infrastructure for MCP gateways and agentic AI architectures/meshes, a PaaS-like platform, ngrok alternative, and even as a homelab infrastructure. It is basically a unified, generic, Kubernetes-like, zero trust architecture (ZTA) for secure access and deployment, that can operate in many human-to-workload, workload-to-workload, and hybrid environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually did a SHOW HN exactly 3 months ago and received lots of invaluable critique regarding how dense, overwhelming and unreadable the docs and repo README were. I've actually spent a lot of time trying to improve the quality of the docs and README since then. I'd love to receive any feedback, negative included, regarding the current overall quality of the docs and README from whoever is interest in that space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m writing a Python framework to create Python home automation scripts driving Zigbee2MQTT with as little boilerplate as possible. https://pyziggy.github.io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had been unemployed for a year and worked a lot on DiffKeep (https://github.com/DiffKeep/DiffKeep), a cross platform AI generated image management program. Fortunately / unfortunately I got a job and haven't been able to dedicate much time to it lately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working to build a tool for macOS and Windows desktops to help non-technical users figure out what's wrong with their home internet and how to fix it. https://www.networkweather.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's literally just me in the garage right now banging out prototypes, talking to MSPs, and probing networks/WiFi/OS to make this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hope is that companies care whether employees are productive when remote/hybrid/on-the-road, or at least are sick of trying to triage first line helpdesk tickets about home network issues and Zoom glitches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to incentivize people to build IRL communities instead of AI-related apps because the demand for human interaction FAR outweighs the supply. My platform (https://onthe.town), is basically Shopify for social experience clubs. Anyone can start a club and create events based around bringing random people together IRL based on shared interests. You get your own website and infra that handles signups, payments, and matching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's largely based on platform-izing the extremely popular Timeleft app that simply matches 6 random people for dinner. With onthe.town, anyone can create a Timeleft-like app around any concept they're interested in. Some clubs people have created include a golf club (get matched with 3 other people to play golf with), a vinyl record sharing club, a lunch club for biotech networking, and a club to meet other parents for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a startup in my region who got popular with the simple idea of having a website/service that manages simple events, like talks, presentations etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it started with mostly students using it because there used to be a lot of university-related events like these, and eventually they’ve become the standard platform for that, at least in the State. It was all pretty simple, it managed payment etc. and you’d get a QR code by email or in the app that could be scanned in the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cordyceps: A port of Playwight that doesn't use CDP or Chrome DevTools Protocol either over websockets or chrome.debugger. Instead it uses pure DOM and Chrome Extension APIs. It includes a port of both Stagehand and Browser Use that run purely inside the Chrome Extension. [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doomberg Terminal: A Chrome Extension that performs algorithmic trading using Robinhood's web interface and market data. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;crx-mcp-over-cdp: This is a proof of concept demonstrating how to run a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server inside a Chrome Extension using Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) - no external server required. (Sort of, I left out the actual MCP library implementation. Ran out of time.) [2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Matry - it's a tool for designing in the browser. It's kind of like a cross between Webflow, Vim, Storybook, and Cursor. I'm trying to strike a fine balance that I don't see in existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing to demo yet, but hopefully I'll have something soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emilia, a personal relationship manager. Every once in a while I meet extended family (wives of cousins or their children) or I meet a fellow soccer parent and I forget their names, or who's related to who.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've used Monica HQ to keep track of this but thought I could tackle differently using AI. With AI you could ask questions like "who's everybody on my aunt's side? Like cousins and their family" and get a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afaik other "relationship managers" out there are professionally oriented, for sales people. A lot of them talk about LinkedIn integration, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a look at http://emilia-workers-website.inerte.workers.dev/ and if you're interested in Alpha testing, send me an email at inerte@gmail.com - I setup a Discord last week so early adopters can chat with me about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to document my current hobby project, but stuck in the analysis phase. I dont even know what it is. When I try to describe its purpose I get blank looks. People tend to need physical demonstrations to understand whats going on. Its not entirely new, or novel, its definitely not revolutionary, but it is a hybrid of so many things, in a very indirect sense, that its just beyond my verbiage. Not a humble brag, I dont think its amazing or anything. I have just failed to describe it. Have been trying to get a phd I know to look at it, and describe it for me, but he just straight up isnt interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, you read it right. 0 false positives. We scan the whole codebase for possible vulnerabilities, rank them, write the proof-of-concept for exploitation, spin up the software in a sandbox, and then attack. All of them happen autonomously without human involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end report? Only verified vulnerabilities are being reported without noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already reported some unknown vulnerabilities in open source projects. The good thing is we're just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since a few months back I am working on a side project to give a snapshot of the regional and global species and natural ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use manual (me) and automated tools (web and literature search tools, llms, visualizers ...) to search, extract, organize and visualize ecosystem literature and data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are some species that are you would like to see a snapshot of, and the region/location let me know and i will try to get a similar visualization. DM or as reply to the chat. Share the species name (common or scientific) and location (can be a city, town, region, province, country).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a work 8n progress, but I would be very happy to recieve feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate what you're doing here. I think it's really important to have this kind of high level overview of these species. I have a little feedback based on clicking around the site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you click on a country in the map view(under Elephants, for example), I think the map still has focus instead of the card. So this means you can't highlight text, click on links, etc within the card. Also if you scroll using the scroll wheel, you end up zooming in and out on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if it would be good to have a "see more" link or some such here, so you can view the same information in the card, but on its own discrete page for each country?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really appreciate that you checked out the website. It is a bit hacky, but for now i am happy with it. Indeed that is correct, the focus is on the map. I am going to fix that. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the see more, it is in my planning. I can do it manually, but I am waiting for some free time to automated that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my free time I’m still working on My Financé (I keep getting feedback this name is confusing), which is a fairly undifferentiated personal finance tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a labor of love, but I love it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m currently building a simulation engine that lets you forecast your spending, build scenarios (like taking a year off, getting a cat, move to a new city, etc based on your current spending patterns and assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know what it is about this name, but I read it as "My Fiancé". My brain did not register the first "n" and it wasn't until I read your parenthetical remark that I went back and re-read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The name isn't confusing, per se ("get married to/be exclusive with your finances", OK), but it also isn't very strong... "financé" is also very strange and awkward to pronounce as a native English speaker. Probably because it comes across more as Spanish-seeming despite it being a play on a French work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Will probably register a proper domain name close to release)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, Astro hasn't had an API like renderToString for React/Vue/etc. that takes a component and renders it on the server. That changed with the release of the Container API last year: https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/container-reference/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are still a lot of rough edges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Importing components is a hassle (you have to go dig through the Astro manifest or create a TS file that exports all your components)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No Vite integration (so no local dev support, or hot reload)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No styling support (this is probably the biggest one)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mighty will provide dev + styling support and a simple way to import your Astro components, with adapters for Hono and Laravel when first releasing. For Hono, it should be as simple as writing a few lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had problems sharing my photos on Instagram so I made an alternative: https://phofee.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made an install script for Arch Linux that sets up the bare essentials for a new install. You can fork it and edit it to your own liking. https://github.com/QCgeneral29/AIP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on https://fontofweb.com, a search engine for real-world web design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most design inspiration sites lean heavily on curated mockups (Dribbble) or award-winning showcases (Awwwards, Mobbin). That makes them polished, but they don’t reflect what most production sites actually look like. Font of Web takes a different approach: it sources directly from live websites, and the community can clip specific elements instead of entire pages. That means you can browse navbars, pricing cards, dashboards, etc., not just full screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each clip is enriched with metadata (fonts, color palettes, original domain). Search works across that metadata, natural language queries (“minimalist fintech dashboard”), and even visual similarity — so you can find results either by text or by image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also a Chrome extension to snip and save from any site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to hear from designers and frontend engineers: is this useful in your workflow? Anything obviously missing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a chat feature to my iOS app size analysis tool that runs locally on your Mac. My goal is to make everyone a build engineer, where you can chat with your builds and get insights and improvement areas. Testing out on-device Apple Intelligence models but need to find the time to do more validation testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm converting PG's essays into latex. It generates 4 "volumes", each with it's own mobile + PDF. It's still early, but am really happy with it so far!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on Fraim, open-source agents for cloudsec and appsec engineers to complement existing deterministic scanners. Born out of our 3 years of learnings building such scanners for IaC. Turns out in the real world policies are subjective enough to make this hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Policies are frequently subjective. Hard to codify, but LLMs can evaluate them more like a security engineer would. "IAM policies should use least privilege." What is "least" enough? "Admin ports shouldn't be exposed to the Internet." What's an admin port?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Security engineers are stretched thin. LLMs can watch PRs for potentially risky changes that need closer human review. "PR loosens authz/authn." "PR changes network perimeter configuration."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Traditional check runs (SAST, IaC, etc.) flood PRs with findings. Security doesn't have time to review them all. Devs tends to ignore them. Frequent false positives. LLMs can draw attention to the important ones. "If the findings are unusual for this repo, require the author to acknowledge the risk before merging."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building an ETL tool that “just works” and gets out of the way. I can write shell scripts and python to do this stuff but honestly I just want to drop my files/API results into a GUI tool and have it combine things for me. Landing page is at https://eetle.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;trying to build a webapp where i apply some recommender systems knowledge to TCG deckbuilding. MtG in particular is suffering from product fatigue and as someone who is both an MLE and a casual MtG player, it has been a fun challenge to apply my skills to a domain of interest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a new CAPTCHA designed to be very simple and user-friendly for humans, while maintaining strong LLM bot protection. I'm currently looking for pilot users (content creators, site owners, or anyone interested) to test it out and provide feedback. If you're interested, please comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picshift.io: upload an image, get a URL, change what shows at that URL whenever you want. Works anywhere an image link works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can randomize and schedule images to show up at the link as well. Super useful for marketing, maintaining screenshots on a website or in documentation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created a 2D platformer inspired by the classic Mario games. The game is called Jolly Land Adventure and I made it because I wanted a simple platformer that's easy to just pick up and play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is available on Steam for Windows, Mac and Linux. The demo contains the entire first episode with 30 levels for anyone who wants to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just an old hobbyist these days. I'm finishing up the written manual portion of a "breadboard helper" for playing with (learning) electronics. The current "helper" I am finishing up gives you instructions (and an explanation) for wiring up over a dozen transistor logic circuits with the aid of a small PCB + breadboard [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by Forrest Mims III, Don Lancaster and the "75 in 1" style electronic project kits my mom got for me for Christmas when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to sell them and then probably never recoup my investment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a notes app that is as simple as Apple notes, but has native markdown support and uses semantic search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uses SwiftUI for the UI, and Zig does most of the heavy lifting on the backend. It's inspired by ghostty which uses a similar setup[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now it only works for Mac, but I'll be porting to iOS as soon as I get the markdown renderer polished. It's not available to the public yet, but I'm using it as my daily driver and hope to release it later this year. I've open sourced it so you can see the source code here[2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been exploring the amazing GCAT space dataset - it’s been a good way to drive some dashboard feature experimentation using fun data. Still need to work on my dashboard design skills, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been sculpting a static site generator for myself in TypeScript. The focus is on accessible, clean, and semantic output. It's one of those endless projects but it's fun to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It focused on critical thinking and communication skills by having dialogues about recent news and announcements at the companies you want to work at. Have a 2 min dialogue and get feedback about how you think and speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-spam email/messaging protocol that is simple, cheap to implement, directly compatible with email/messengers, low false negative rate compared to current spam filtering, free for senders, and does not require the sender to pay to send a message. For people who receive too much marketing spam, survey spam, low-effort cold emails, and want to be able to easily filter spam successfully because you do not want to waste time on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future-proofed and will work on AI spam in the future too, unlike current spam filtering methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An “everything” feed reader. Its a plugable framework that allows you to push anything into an RSS feed reader type interface. Email, Slack notifications, RSS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want one place to manage ALL notification settings. So if I want to be notified of Slack messages that contain the word “cat”, I can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am also looking to add summarization and tagging using a local SLM. Trying to find a method that can run on older hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diplomium helps educators and event organizers create and deliver authenticated certificates at scale. Instead of manually designing and emailing PDFs, you upload a simple Excel, pick a template, and the system generates + sends personalized certificates automatically—each with a unique QR code for instant validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bigger picture: Certificates are often the only tangible outcome of a learning experience. By making them verifiable, permanent, and easy to distribute, organizations save admin time while learners get a trustworthy credential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Status: Running for 2 years, used by schools and training centers in Latin America. Now building AI-powered features for design editing and data extraction from PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A command-line tool called berk that is a versatile job dispatcher written in c. It is meant to replace big clunky tools like Jenkins, Ansible etc. It has syntax similar to git. It works pretty well, just need to iron out some kinks before final release. https://github.com/jezze/berk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banker (banker.so): An AI spreadsheet that excels at spreadsheet understanding (pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some AI spreadsheet products out there mostly as plugins along with MS Copilot. However my experience with them showed that they are bad at understanding spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason is that sheets are 2D data models. Because LLMs are trained on 1D data models (simply text), translation of 2D data models to formats an LLM can consume is a big context engineering task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read and implemented some of the algos mentioned in SpreadsheetLLM paper released by Microsoft. Ironic, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got it to a nice working state. Give it a go - if you need more tokens, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A super easy-to-install monitoring tool that doesn’t require bash scripts or config files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A mobile-friendly, UX-first interface where I can check everything from my phone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s now pretty feature complete. I can see a full picture of all the servers and VPS I run straight from my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup is one command, no config files, and everything else happens in the UI. There’s a catalog of predefined alert rules, and creating new ones is easier than anything else I’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on the Restful Atmos Sleep Lamp, a smart bedside lamp that automatically shifts throughout the day and night for the circadian rhythm, reducing blue light at night and maximizing blue light during the day. There is a machine learning layer that learns your preferences and automatically adjusts the intensity of the light, similarly to the Nest Thermostat [0].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, shipping Bedtime Bulb v2 next month. This is a hybrid LED-incandescent design meant for the evening that is the best of both worlds: low blue light, high color quality, perfect compatibility with dimmers, 10x less flicker than incandescent, includes near infrared, low energy use, long lifespan [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A burnout detector for SREs. The goal is to help teams identify incident responders who may be overworked/getting burned out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are looking at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Objective data: signals from incident management tools (Rootly/PagerDuty), GitHub, and Slack&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Self-reported data: asking the engineers how they feel via short survey&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this, we generate a CBI score (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory). We're still in beta, but we've received positive feedback from our beta testers, especially from manager of large and distributed orgs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://multi.dev, an AI coding agent with bunch of FOSS contributors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We took a great amount of learning from tools like Cline, Roo.. After spending some time on their tech as active users/devs, we decided to build multi from scratch with drastically different take on core features, tech stack, ux/devex..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are an active user of similar tools, and/or want to try multi.. We want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-- edit: I am one of the core contributors to multi. And we are in the process of open sourcing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a tiny cli project, tascli: https://github.com/Aperocky/tascli, a local fast and simple personal task and record manager. Specifically, I need to update it to support recurring task and records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codexes Factory: algorithmic tools to create, operate, distribute, and market entire publishing imprints. This week I am launching my first imprint, Xynapse Traces, with 66 books in the Korean pilsa (筆寫) style. Later in October, Nimble Ultra, devoted to the history and practice of intelligence and espionage. Last week I built a giant collection of 575 imprints that are a shadow superset of the ~540 imprints operated by the Big Five publishing houses (Penguin Random House, the largest has ~300). Teeny weeny tip of the iceberg at NimbleBooks.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a digital comic book store. Letterboxd with a buy button. It's really fun. We've got a lot of great publishers signed, and a great team. It's such a thrill to work in a space where people work their ass off to create art, in spite of the fact that the rewards are minimal. Our job, we feel, is to make them more money to make more art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scrolling Stock Price "LED" Ticker for Windows. I could never find one that did what I wanted so with the help of Copilot I built my own. Still has some bugs I am working on but I would love some feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gives you precise control over every shade/tint (no AI or auto generation!) so you can incorporate your own brand colors, and helps you build palettes that have simple to follow color contrast guarantees by design e.g. all grade 600 colors have 4.5:1 WCAG contrast (for body text) against all grade 50 colors, such as red-600 vs gray-50, or green-600 vs gray-50. There's export options for plain CSS, Tailwind, Figma, and Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm really open to feedback on what problems and needs people have for creating accessible designs!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving my 'Video game generator from photos'. The bottleneck of this kind of generator is 'how much time to obtain the video game". I managed on my last vacation (it's a side project) to reduced it to 2 hours. This is an example of one FPS made by my tool : https://free-visit.net/fr/demo01&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a site for filmmakers to help showcase themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LinkedIn isn't for creatives. Actor's Access is dated and charges a ton for basic extras Squarespace/wix is fine but everyone in 'the biz' has one and nobody wants to maintain it. Plus they're all silo'd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out my site if you wanna. You get to host your own headshots, resume, and reels. You can upload your screenplay there and hear it read outloud. You can put up your cinematic scores and make a place to send people to hear your music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a WordPress PaaS with dedicated lanes for bots. The status quo around WordPress is that you block bots using Cloudflare, else your site crashes. Since AI search is here to stay, we need a way to let bots crawl WordPress sites without crashing the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building with python/fastapi, react/tailwind/vite, with Claude Code and using test-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red-green-refactor is tedious for humans but perfect for AI. And the test names &amp;amp; code make great documentation of every micro decision, running in milliseconds to prevent regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software itself helps people perform construction approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old way: dozens of documents and versions sent back and forth over email. Many fiddly details that must be checked - to streamline the process we'll use AI to provide verdicts that help humans make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plan to create content &amp;amp; teach what I've learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i've been incrementally hiking the via francigena (https://www.viefrancigene.org/en/walking/) and am working through integrating my gpx, geotagged photos, and oura ring data to both illustrate my journey and analyze how different terrains and altitudes affected the collected biometrics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ingesting/parsing gpx layers into duckdb using python to extract tags and load api data. using minio right now but ultimately want to push to cloudflare free tools or vercel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to get my agentic software specification tool Arbiter to release (UI polish/debugging is so slow :/, browser shenanigans are harder than Rust fr). It's basically a tool that AI agents can use to construct a project specification. The twist to Arbiter is that the specs are structured and validated, and you can compile them to get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Services with stubbed endpoints, UIs with placeholder components, Dockerfiles/Terraform/K8s infra, E2E tests (via declared flows), Github/Gitlab epics/issues/subissues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also got github/gitlab webhook integration, so you can do stuff like trigger agents reactively when events occur on a repo, it includes cloudflare tunnel support so you can set up webhooks even in a local dev environment, and the project generator is fully customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nope, it's a structured spec agents construct using a CLI or MCP (you can also interact with the spec using a web UI). It's CUE, and validated against a schema. Instead of taking your conversation and generating a markdown document that agents might (but often don't) respect, the agent populates the spec in the service from your conversation, then when you're done you can use the CLI to automatically generate a bunch of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am all-in on a Unity game right now. Working with one other person and hoping to ship to Steam later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking about play testing at scale is a new thing for me. I've been getting into visualization techniques like using 3d textures to build voxel heat maps in-editor. We've managed to accumulate quite a bit of play testing telemetry already. The power of aggregated statistics in the editor views is absolutely mind-blowing to me. For level designers it's like having proper omniscience. Being able to see things like thousands of samples (manifesting as a bright red voxel) that wound up tripping over the same misplaced geometry is like cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://pneumatter.com to explore embodying articles of Programmable Architecture (self-assembling buildings)which are weather-compliant, resource generating, and optionally permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm vibe coding using GitHub Copilot and JetBrains AI Pro on a Blazor web app that tracks my investment in like index funds, stocks, ETFs, etc. It's a simple CRUD web app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is nearly completed, and Grok (preview in Copilot, currently free) wrote most of the CRUD pages with Entity Framework. Of course, it does get things wrong, and I use Claude 4 to fix the issues. (i'm a C# dev, I review code generated by Grok sometimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building AI workbench and tools for Home Service Business verticals. I found there is a lot of waste in targeting and workflows for business, focussing on improving them with advanced YOLO and LLM models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pptx-tools, a collection of cli tools for interacting with Powerpoint presentations. Covers use cases that PowerPoint doesn't support. Currently in the making:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* pptx-grep - find text across multiple powerpoints, yield file/slide no and text excerpt of match&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* pptx-dump - dumps extended info about a powerpoint, such as number of slides, applied master slides, used fonts etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* pptx-lint - allows to define validation rules for pptx based on content and/or formatting. E.g. presentation must not contain word "TBD", all text must be formatted in Arial etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Colanode, which is built to close the gap between the convenience of cloud tools and the ownership of local software. It brings chat, docs, databases, and files into one open-source, self-hostable workspace where data lives on your devices first and syncs in the background. Unlike typical SaaS tools, Colanode is local-first: everything works instantly and offline, infrastructure stays minimal, and you keep full control of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a bit of a checklist nerd, so I wrote a web app do to checklists: https://checkoff.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it is fashionable these days, it can create checklists with AI ("Fun things to do in Pittsburg"), you can create checklists from templates (some stuff you do every day), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also have an MCP server that allows you to plug it into your favorite LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone’s drowning in long articles, dense PDFs, and hour-long videos. I’m working on https://unrav.io , it lets you flip any article, paper, or YouTube link into the format you actually want (summary, mindmap, podcast, infographic, etc.) in one click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I’m experimenting with a simple bookmarklet trigger instead of a browser extension. Curious: how do HN folks feel about bookmarklets in 2025, still viable, or do you prefer extensions?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building Bloomberry - an alternative to Builtwith. While the latter focuses on frontend tech, I cover almost every SaaS product category. Want to know companies that use Microsoft Dynamics or Zoom? You can with Bloomberry, but not with Builtwith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;rovr, a terminal file explorer because there just isnt enough competing using the textual framework, i have proper mouse handling thanks to it, that i noticed was missing in superfile, or just wasnt nice to use in yazi im taking a look at asyncio to replace threads in the program to hopefully help performance https://github.com/NSPC911/rovr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just shipped 3pio, a drop-in test runner that context-optimizes your test output. It uses your existing test runner and tests so zero changes to your codebase or tooling to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IME it results in much less context clutter from your test output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am creating a webapp to let screenwriters collaborate when writing their scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have several friends in this industry and their tooling is either expensive, not localized for their market or straight away bad (I've seen terrible dataloss).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got some inspiration from linear and am building it on top of ruby on rails with CRDTs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scriptwriting require specific formatting (set by Hollywood ages ago). Doing this in google docs is really painful. Besides that, people who work in this industry are already used to the format, so if you wanna pitch something to studios, they expect to be in industry format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a personal knowledge system. It's a zettelkasten with an LLM substrate. It uses LLMs to build a model of the theses, arguments and facts used in cards, and uses these to both summarize the information on the card and to automatically link cards together based on shared concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this is really necessary, but I created it after doing an in-house CTF challenge, with no LLM rules, and I was giving several LLM CLI’s a lot of leeway and iterating very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im working on (slowly) a very very niche web app to help my wife manage her dog breeding program. Maybe it'll be useful enough for other breeders to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a super-simple budgeting app called https://4keynumbers.com, which is based on Ramit Sethi's Conscious Spending Plan. It currently syncs my expenses from Plaid and cooks it down into a single chart, with only savings, investments, bills/fixed, and "safe to spend" as categories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a "Data Governance in a Box" solution for small businesses that are using out of data routers and security practices. Starting here in Canada, but open to collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m at a crossroads with my Speed Cubing Competitions listing app (SCComps.com). It’s an iOS app built in Flutter, has around 250 downloads, and currently generates no revenue. I'm spending about $500 a year just to keep it running. There’s little community engagement, and I'm debating whether to double down and rebuild it in Swift—or just shut it down altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is mostly a nostalgia play--I'm pining for a time when app development was much easier. I'm trying to apply lessons from early Rapid Application Development while still providing a full-featured language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I confess that I haven't gotten any traction at all, but I find it incredibly useful for my own consulting business, so I'm going to keep on working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I've been working on https://terragonlabs.com which is a way to orchestrate Claude Code and other agents (Amp, Codex) as background agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like I am locally constantly bouncing between different agents for different tasks and really wanted to be able to do the same in a remote environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A script which will find random pictures of anyone in the family from the Immich database, resize them and add metadata on them like where they were taken and when and put them on the TV to show as kind of a screen saver when we're at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like this Facebook feature which shows you "Today 10 years ago", Immich, does have it in it's UI too and perhaps I will mix in those pictures also to show on TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to build a secure, configurable and easy to use authentication system (relative to my understanding)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have experienced knowledge gaps and blind spots that I am attempting to fix. For example most users worry about security of hashed passwords and yet they do not realize that the TOTP (eg Google Authenticator) use symmetric encryption and quite a lot of the authentication providers store the private key in plain text in their database. List goes on...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a text-based softball league simulator where you forcibly enlist your friends and family to join your co-ed softball team. You play as their manager/coach/fellow player.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every aspect of the games are narrated in real time so you know what's going on. I'm still in the prototype stage and I've seen some pretty hilarious interactions already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a self hosted reddit like suggestion board to Kinn (https://kinn.gg). We help game developers analyze player feedback from Discord, Steam, YouTube and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on writing two appendix sections on knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning for Machine Learning for Drug Discovery [1], which were initiated as tangents to expand coverage of material from a few earlier chapters. I hope to also write these appendix sections up as freely available articles (at least in a condensed form). Thankfully, I'll be able to finish the knowledge distillation section this month but, unfortunately, I need to pivot to finishing out chapter 11 to stay on schedule for full publication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suppose it has moved from “what are you working” to “what have you worked on” territory, but since I wrapped up the website just about a week ago it still feels quite fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always interested in feedback and what folks find useful! It’s focused on the mechanics of writing understandable software, which I think is especially important in the age of AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on an AI-optimized query language. Like a terse, logical SQL. So smaller models can translate natural languages to DB queries more accurately. Saves lots of compute in RAG.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterministic guarantees, and corrective behavioral monitoring for ai agents (starting with claude code, and ADK). Think security + performance bumper rails. At the cost of 0 context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was the feature requestor for Claude Code Hooks - and have been involved in ai governance for quite awhile, this is an idea I'm excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ping below if you want to early beta test. everything is open source, no signups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on character.ai for learning Chinese, you chat with characters at your level, and get instant feedback on your writing. It's a way to get a wide amount of comprehensible input in an engaging way that also practices output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is really cool, I'm interested in this as I'm also a chinese learner and I thought about doing sometihng kinda similar (just locally)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the UI, really cool project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the prompting might need more work to make it natural though. I just tried a "hungover chat with 996" worker, and the responses seemed to be lacking a little too much context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a specification for a personal library app in the hopes I can get AppSheet + Gemini to make one for me. I'm working on library science in general, so it will hopefully implement ideas I have about book classification and entity catalogs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve created an AI-powered app designed to help candidates prepare for Meta’s product manager interviews, with a focus on product execution questions. The app allows you to practice by speaking or typing your responses, then uses AI to score answers against a rubric and track your progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m looking for beta testers—happy to share early access if you’re interested! If you are please message me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a dumb phone. Been messing around with setting a phone number to call to get SMS directions and things of that sort. Then I wanted to build my own phone so I got a LTE module and been messing around with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About the first part, I am working on something similar for myself. If you want an api to get SMS for free, without needing any 10dlc stuff, check out groupme, which supports SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- hiragana / katakana / time reading / number reading quizzers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- learn kanji with FSRS, anki-style&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- vocab quizzer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- the coolest feature (imo) is a "reader": upload Japanese texts (light novels, children's books, etc), then translate them to your native language to practice your reading comprehension. Select text anywhere on the page (with your cursor) to instantly do a dictionary lookup. A LLM evaluates your translation accuracy (0..100%) and suggests other possible interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's all elixir+liveview+postgres+pgroonga (though there are times when I would like to have SolidJS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been considering open-sourcing it due to lack of commercial success, but might try an ad-based approach first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;creating a kanban editor for vscode that can integrate images, videos etc. i use it for planning and creating lectures over several weeks. it can export to a marp compatible presentation format. it's coded with claude, because i would not have had the time to do it othervise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional Knowledge: Constrained to Ibn Seerin's classical teachings — trusted by Muslims for over 1,000 years AI-Powered Analysis: Unlock the meaning of your dream with 4,300 dream symbols from the Dictionary of Dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Share your dream confidentially, answer a few context questions, and receive your authentic Islamic interpretation in under a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an MVP which I started &amp;lt;4 weeks ago. Currently validating Desirability, Feasibility, and Viability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confidentiality is very difficult to guarantee. You may want to put some brackets on what your users can realistically expect and give them tips on how they can stay anonymous. But lovely and novel idea, really neat to see these kind of cross-overs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the app's dream input page, it specifies a bit more "Your dreams are private and not stored or collected." - would that cover it? Thanks for your feedback and encouragement!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is a 'pinky promise', it may well be true and let's assume you are well intentioned but it leaves the door open to you not being trustworthy after all or someone intercepting the data while it is being processed (for instance, by compromising your service).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order for you to process the dream data you have to at least make a temporary copy. One way to get rid of that is to move the interpretation part to the client side if possible. Another thing you could do is if people are really concerned about the content of a particular dream to suggest they use TOR or some other anonymization (not perfect, I know) service to at least hide their internet location from you, the operator of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the app itself run entirely within your own infrastructure or does it call out for part of the work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, I'll probably send an email later to support to ask (no rush, since it's out of stock anyway), but I was checking for info on compatibility with Yamaha (e.g. my Cross Connect) ebikes. It's not on the compatibility list. They make their own (mid-drive) motors (PW-SE on mine I think) and proprietary batteries. They pulled out of the United States market altogether so getting more batteries from them again is doubtful. (Mine currently charges to ~85% and then throws an error code, but it still works for now.) It is a Yamaha 500Wh36V battery pack on the down tube with 3 wires (I just unscrewed where the battery plugs in to see).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been wondering for years if historical magazines/periodicals could ever be transformed into a modern ebook format. PDF doesn't cut it, but most other efforts are unsatisfactory... part of what makes a magazine a magazine is the rich, mixed content. So, for the past few weeks (months?) I've been taking a stab at it with the science fiction pulps. Started with Analog/Astounding, and I was able to re-typeset the cover (with original art), most of the interior, many of the ads, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm writing a programming language for feature-flags/remote-config. I figure a simple DSL has to be an improvement over YAML or a series of forms in a web app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also generally disappointed by the lack of testing that's performed on feature-flag definitions. So I'd like to have a test runner capable of asserting your feature flag's rules matches your intent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, I think it would be funny if you put plaintext that says "just bought the milliondollargpt.com and have no idea what to do with it...". Optionally as a hyperlink to your comment I am replying to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh hey I can post an update. My little electronic dictionary is finished. Software works and it's all dressed up in a stealth notebook case. (It runs Python now instead of Lisp though)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My theory of learning is that you learn the characters better if you learn how to read and write them at the same time. And flash cards are better by giving you as much information as possible about the character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is fundamentally different from e.g. WaniKani which only teaches you how to read the character and relies on pre-made mnemonics (plus SRS) for easier retention, and from Anki which (normally) has very minimal flash cards, showing only small bits of information per card. When you have the whole dictionary on each card it gives you the opportunity to create the easiest connection with what you already know. This may be some made up story about the components (radicals) in the kanji (like WaniKani does) a word you already know, other kanji sharing the components, etc. The more connections you make the easier it is to learn them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the features I personally use extensively is the ability to bookmark words containing the kanji, which will then pop up at the top of the words section in a later review. If I remember the meaning and the reading of the words I have bookmarked for this character during a reading review, I consider mark card as good. If I remember none of them I mark it “again”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A fast combinations calculation in jax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Idea of combinadic implementation is from https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2022/06/28/generating-the-mth-lexicographical-element-of-a-combination-using-the-combinadic and some useful information can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_number_system. Below I copied and aggregated some of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code demostrates the combinations calculation in numpy and via combinadics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    # setup
    n = 4
    k = 3
    totalcount = math.comb(n, k)

    # numpy
    print(f"Calculate combinations \"{n} choose {k}\" in numpy:")
    for comb in itertools.combinations(np.arange(start=0, stop=n, dtype=jnp.int32), k):
        print(comb)

    # combinadics
    print("Calculate via combinadics:")
    actual = n-1 - calculateMth(n, k, totalcount-1 - jnp.arange(start=0, stop=n, dtype=jnp.int32),)
    for comb in actual:
        print(comb)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the output from execution of the code is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Calculate combinations "4 choose 3" in numpy:
(0, 1, 2)
(0, 1, 3)
(0, 2, 3)
(1, 2, 3)
Calculate via combinadics:
[0 1 2]
[0 1 3]
[0 2 3]
[1 2 3]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of a combinadic as an alternate representation of an integer. Consider the integer &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combinadic of an integer is its representation based on a variable base corresponding to the values of the binomial coefficient &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With (&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of how a combinadic is calculated. Suppose you are working with (&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combinadic of 8 will have the form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to determine the value of &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point we have used up &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used up &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, continuing the first example above for the number &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table below shows the relationships among &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;m dual(m) Element(m) combinadic(m) (n-1) - ci
==============================================

[1]  8    { 0 1 3 }   ( 3 1 0 )     ( 1 3 4 )
[2]  7    { 0 1 4 }   ( 3 2 0 )     ( 1 2 4 )

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Safe zero-copy operations in C#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My attempt at talking about one of the most underrated features of C#.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C# is a versatile language. You can write mobile apps, desktop apps, games, websites, services and APIs with it. You can write it like Java with all the abstractions and &lt;code&gt;AbstractionFactoryClassProvider&lt;/code&gt;s. But differently from Java, you can write low-level and unsafe code too. When I say low-level, I mean without the GC, with raw pointers. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-level code is usually required for performance or interoperability with C libraries or the operating system. The reason low-level code helps with performance is that it can be used to eliminate runtime checks on memory accesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Array element accesses are bounds-checked in C# for safety. But, that means that there's performance impact unless the compiler can eliminate a bounds-checking operation. The bounds-checking elimination logic needs to ensure that the array index was already bounds-checked before, or can be assured to be inside bounds during the compile-time. For example, take this simple function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int sum(int[] array)
{
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; array.Length; i++)
  {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's an ideal situation for bounds-checking elimination because the index variable &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is created with known boundaries, and it depends on the array's length. The index variable's lifetime is shorter than the array's lifetime and it's guaranteed to be contained valid values throughout the function. The native code produced for &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; has no bounds-checking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;L0000	xor	    eax, eax
L0002	xor	    edx, edx
L0004	mov     r8d, [rcx+8]          ; read length
L0008	test    r8d, r8d              ; is empty?
L000b	jle	    short L001c           ; skip the loop
L000d	mov	    r10d, edx
L0010	add	    eax, [rcx+r10*4+0x10] ; sum += array[i];
L0015	inc	    edx                   ; i++
L0017	cmp	    r8d, edx              ; compare length with i
L001a	jg	    short L000d           ; loop if still greater
L001c	ret	&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, what if the function signature was slightly different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int sum(int[] array, int startIndex, int endIndex)
{
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = startIndex; i &amp;lt;= endIndex; i++)
  {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the C# compiler doesn't have a way to know if the passed &lt;code&gt;startIndex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;endIndex&lt;/code&gt; values are inside the boundaries of &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt; because their lifetimes are distinct. So the native assembly produced becomes way more involved with bounds-checking operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;L0000	sub		rsp, 0x28				
L0004	xor		eax, eax			; sum = 0
L0006	cmp		edx, r8d			; startIndex &amp;gt; endIndex?
L0009	jg		short L0045			; then skip the entire function
L000b	test	rcx, rcx			; array is null?
L000e	je		short L0031			; then cause NullReferenceException
L0010	mov		r10d, edx
L0013	or		r10d, r8d
L0016	jl		short L0031
L0018	cmp		[rcx+8], r8d		; array.Length &amp;lt;= endIndex ?
L001c	jle		short L0031			; then do bounds-checking
L001e	xchg	ax, ax				; alignment NOP
L0020	mov		r10d, edx
L0023	add		eax, [rcx+r10*4+0x10]   ; sum += array[i]
L0028	inc		edx					; consider i + 1
L002a	cmp		edx, r8d			; i &amp;gt; endIndex?
L002d	jle		short L0020			; no, go on
L002f	jmp		short L0045			; return
L0031	cmp		edx, [rcx+8]		; i &amp;gt; array.Length?
L0034	jae		short L004a			; bounds-checking failed. go to ----+
L0036	mov		r10d, edx												|
L0039	add		eax, [rcx+r10*4+0x10]	; sum += array[i]				|
L003e	inc		edx					; i++								|
L0040	cmp		edx, r8d			; i &amp;lt;= endIndex ?					|
L0043	jle		short L0031			; continue for loop					|
L0045	add		rsp, 0x28												|
L0049	ret							; return sum						|
L004a	call	0x00007ff857ec6200	; throw IndexOutOfRangeException &amp;lt;--+
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could use low-level unsafe functions and pointers in C# (yes, C# supports raw pointers!) to avoid bounds-checking altogether, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;unsafe int sum(int* ptr, int length)
{
  int* end = ptr + length;
  int sum = 0;
  for (; ptr &amp;lt; end; ptr++)
  {
    sum += *ptr;
  }
  return sum;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That also creates a very optimized code that supports passing along a sub-portion of an array:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;L0000	movsxd	rax, edx        
L0003	lea	rax, [rcx+rax*4]    ; end = ptr + length
L0007	xor	edx, edx            ; sum = 0
L0009	cmp	rcx, rax            ; ptr &amp;gt;= end ?
L000c	jae	short L0019         ; then return
L000e	add	edx, [rcx]          ; sum += *ptr
L0010	add	rcx, 4              ; ptr += sizeof(int)
L0014	cmp	rcx, rax            ; ptr &amp;lt; end?
L0017	jb	short L000e         ; then keep looping
L0019	mov	eax, edx
L001b	ret	                    ; return sum&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsafe code and pointer-arithmetic can be very performant as you can see. The problem is that it's too dangerous. With incorrect values of length, you don't simply get an &lt;code&gt;IndexOutOfRangeException&lt;/code&gt; but instead your app either crashes, or returns incorrect results. If your code happened to modify the memory region instead of just reading it, then you could have a nice entry point for a buffer overflow security vulnerability in your app too. Not to mention that all the callers of that function will have to have unsafe blocks too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it's possible to handle this safe and fast in C# without resorting to esoteric rituals like that. First, how do you solve this problem of indexes to describe a portion of an array and actual boundaries of the array being disconnected from each other? You create a new immutable type that holds these values together. And that type is called a span in C#. Other programming languages may call it a slice. Declaration of &lt;code&gt;Span&lt;/code&gt; type resembles something like this. Well, it's not exactly this, but I want you to understand the concept first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;readonly struct Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
  readonly T* _ptr;
  readonly int _len;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's basically an immutable pointer with length. The great thing about a type like this is that the compiler can assure that once an immutable Span is initialized with correct bounds, it will always be safe to access without any bounds-checking. That means, you can pass around sub-views of arrays or even other spans safely and quickly without the performance overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, how can it be safe? What if the GC decides to throw away the structure that &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; points to? Well, that's where "ref types" come into play in C#.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ref type is a type that can't leave the stack and escape to the heap, so it's always guaranteed that a &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; type will outlive a &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instance. That's why the actual &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; declaration looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;readonly ref struct Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;  // notice "ref" 
{
  readonly ref T _ptr;        // notice "ref"
  readonly int _len;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since a ref type can only live in stack, it can't be a member of a class, nor can it be assigned to a non-ref variable, like, it can't be boxed either. A ref type can only be contained inside another ref type. It's ref types all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Span-based version of our &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; function can eliminate bounds-checking despite that it can now have several super powers. The first one is that it can receive a sub-view of an array too with specific indices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int sum(Span&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; span)
{
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; span.Length; i++)
  {
    sum += span[i];
  }
  return sum;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance you can call this function with &lt;code&gt;sum(array)&lt;/code&gt; or you can call it with a sub-view of an array like &lt;code&gt;sum(array[startIndex..endIndex])&lt;/code&gt;. That wouldn't incur new bounds-checking operations other than when you're trying to slice the array using the range operator. See how the generated assembly code for &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; becomes optimized again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;L0000	mov	rax, [rcx]
L0003	mov	ecx, [rcx+8]
L0006	xor	edx, edx            ; sum = 0
L0008	xor	r8d, r8d            ; i = 0
L000b	test	ecx, ecx		; span.Length == 0?
L000d	jle	short L001e
L000f	mov	r10d, r8d
L0012	add	edx, [rax+r10*4]    ; sum += span[i]
L0016	inc	r8d                 ; i++
L0019	cmp	r8d, ecx            ; i &amp;lt; Length?
L001c	jl	short L000f         ; then keep looping
L001e	mov	eax, edx            
L0020	ret						; return sum&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another superpower you get is that the ability to declare the data structure you receive immutable in your function signature, so your function is guaranteed not to touch it, and you can find bugs instantly. All you need to do is to replace &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Then your attempts to modify the span contents will immediately cause a compiler error. Something impossible with regular arrays, even if you declare them &lt;code&gt;readonly&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;readonly&lt;/code&gt; directive only protects the reference from modification not the contents of the data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How is it related to zero-copy?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passing along a smaller portion of a larger data structure to relevant APIs used to involve either copying or passing the relevant part's offset and length values along with that data structure. It required the API to support calls with larger structures with offsets. It was impossible to guarantee the safety of such APIs as the relationship between parameters couldn't be established by the compiler or the runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's now both easy and expressive to implement zero-copy operations safely using spans. Consider a Quicksort implementation for instance; it usually has a function like this that works with portions of a given array:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int partition(int[] array, int low, int high)
{
  int midpoint = (high + low) / 2; // I know, we'll get there!
  int mid = array[midpoint];

  // tuple swaps in C#! ("..^1" means "Length - 1")
  (array[midpoint], array[^1]) = (array[^1], array[midpoint]);
  int pivotIndex = 0;
  for (int i = low; i &amp;lt; high - 1; i++)
  {
     if (array[i] &amp;lt; mid)
     {
       swap(array, i, pivotIndex);
       pivotIndex += 1;
     }
  }
  (array[midpoint], array[endpoint]) = (array[endpoint], array[midpoint]);
  return pivotIndex;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function receives an array and offsets that designate a part of it, and rearranges the items based on a picked value in it. Values smaller than it move to the left, larger than it move to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mid = array[midpoint]&lt;/code&gt; has to be bounds-checked because the compiler can't know if the index is inside the bounds of this array. The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop also performs bounds-check for array accesses in the loop, which some of them can be eliminated, but not fully guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also an overflow error because we pass array ranges using &lt;code&gt;high&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;low&lt;/code&gt; values: &lt;code&gt;(high+low)&lt;/code&gt; can overflow for very large arrays, and the results would be catastrophic, can even cause buffer overflow exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;partition&lt;/code&gt; function gets recursively called many times by &lt;code&gt;Quicksort&lt;/code&gt; function below, so that means bounds-checking can be a performance issue. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void Quicksort(int[] array, int low, int high)
{
  if (array.Length &amp;lt;= 1)
  {
    return;
  }

  int pivot = partition(array, low, high);
  Quicksort(span, low, pivot - 1);
  Quicksort(span, pivot + 1, high);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With spans, the same Quicksort function looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void Quicksort(Span&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; span)
{
  if (span.Length &amp;lt;= 1)
  {
    return;
  }

  int pivot = partition(span);
  Quicksort(span[..pivot]);
  Quicksort(span[(pivot + 1)..]);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See how expressive using spans are especially with the range syntax? It lets you get a new span out of an existing span or an array using double dots (&lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt;)? And the partition function even looks much better too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int partition(Span&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; span)
{
  int midpoint = span.Length / 2; // look ma, no buffer overflows!
  int mid = span[midpoint];
  (span[midpoint], span[^1]) = (span[^1], span[midpoint]);
  int pivotIndex = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; span.Length - 1; i++)
  {
     if (span[i] &amp;lt; mid)
     {
       swap(array, i, pivotIndex);
       pivotIndex += 1;
     }
  }
  (span[midpoint], span[^1]) = (span[^1], span[midpoint]);
  return pivotIndex;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because C# spans are also zero-based, it's harder to have buffer overflow problems caused by formulae like &lt;code&gt;(low + high) / 2&lt;/code&gt;. Now, the implementation is as fast as an unsafe implementation with raw pointers, but still extremely safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New zero-copy operations in .NET runtime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used a recursive example here to show how sub-portions of a larger data structure can be passed to another function, but spans can be used almost everywhere, and now .NET runtime supports zero-copy alternatives of popular functions too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take &lt;code&gt;String.Split&lt;/code&gt; for example. You can now split a string without creating new copies of every split portion of the string. You can split a CSV line into its parts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;string csvLine = // .. read CSV line
string[] parts = csvLine.Split(',');

foreach (string part in parts)
{
  Console.WriteLine(part);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with that is, now you're dealing with newly created 5 buffers with varying lengths. .NET allocates new memory for them, GC keeps track of them. It's slow, it hogs memory. It's problematic especially in loops, and can create GC pressure, slowing your app even more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can instead cast your CSV line into a &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and iterate over its components to write it to the output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great ROI of that experiment is making zero memory allocations after reading CSV line into memory. A similar logic that improves performance and memory efficiency can be applied everywhere that can receive a &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of an array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Embrace the future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spans and slice-like structures in are the future of safe memory operations in modern programming languages. Embrace them. The quick takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use spans over arrays in your function declarations unless you explicitly require a standalone array in your function for some reason. Such a change opens your API into zero-copy optimization scenarios, and calling code will be more expressive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't bother with unsafe/pointers if you can code the same logic with spans. You can still perform low-level memory operations without wandering into the dangerous parts of the forest. Your code will still be fast, and yet safer.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use spans, wherever possible, mostly readonly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to create an OS from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to learn how to make an OS from scratch. In college I was taught how to implement advanced features (pagination, semaphores, memory management, etc) but:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I never got to start from my own boot sector&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;College is hard so I don't remember most of it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'm fed up with people who think that reading an already existing kernel, even if small, is a good idea to learn operating systems.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by this document and the OSDev wiki, I'll try to make short step-by-step READMEs and code samples for anybody to follow. Honestly, this tutorial is basically the first document but split into smaller pieces and without the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Updated: more sources: the little book about OS development, JamesM's kernel development tutorials&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This course is a code tutorial aimed at people who are comfortable with low level computing. For example, programmers who have curiosity on how an OS works but don't have the time or willpower to start reading the Linux kernel top to bottom.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is little theory. Yes, this is a feature. Google is your theory lecturer. Once you pass college, excessive theory is worse than no theory because it makes things seem more difficult than they really are.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The lessons are tiny and may take 5-15 minutes to complete. Trust me and trust yourself. You can do it!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the first folder and go down in order. They build on previous code, so if you jump right to folder 05 and don't know why there is a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mov ah, 0x0e&lt;/code&gt;, it's because you missed lecture 02. Really, just go in order. You can always skip stuff you already know.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Open the README and read the first line, which details the concepts you should be familiar with before reading the code. Google concepts you are not familiar with. The second line states the goals for each lesson. Read them, because they explain why we do what we do. The "why" is as important as the "how".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Read the rest of the README. It is very concise.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(Optional) Try to write the code files by yourself after reading the README.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look at the code examples. They are extremely well commented.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(Optional) Experiment with them and try to break things. The only way to make sure you understood something is trying to break it or replicate it with different commands.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: First read the README on each folder, then the code files. If you're brave, try to code them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will want to do many things with our OS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boot from scratch, without GRUB - DONE!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enter 32-bit mode - DONE&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jump from Assembly to C - DONE!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interrupt handling - DONE!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Screen output and keyboard input - DONE!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A tiny, basic &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt;which grows to suit our needs - DONE!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write a filesystem to store files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a very simple shell&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe we will write a simple text editor&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple processes and scheduling&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably we will go through them in that order, however it's soon to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we feel brave enough:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A BASIC interpreter, like in the 70s!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A GUI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Networking&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a personal learning project, and even though it hasn't been updated for a long time, I still have hopes to get into it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm thankful to all those who have pointed out bugs and submitted pull requests. I will need some time to review everything and I cannot guarantee that at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please feel free to fork this repo. If many of you are interested in continuing the project, let me know and I'll link the "main fork" from here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FAA decides it trusts Boeing enough to certify the safety of its own planes again&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Jet maker only gets to issue certs every other week, though, freeing up FAA inspectors to do more poking around&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of relying on the FAA to certify its jets as airworthy, Boeing is finally going to be allowed to do so itself – sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday that it was granting Boeing "limited delegation" to issue its own airworthiness certificates for the 737 Max and 787 aircraft, which it hasn't been able to do since 2019 and 2022, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boeing lost its ability to certify the airworthiness of the 737 Max after a pair of crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. The agency took 787 certification out of Boeing's hands due to what the FAA said was "production quality issues."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we've previously reported, the 787's problems include things like a need to be power cycled every 51 days due to faulty software, easy hackability of plane systems, melting batteries, and other issues pointed out before the FAA took control of its airworthiness. Not that things have become much better for the 787 since the FAA assumed responsibility for its airworthiness, mind you: Since then Boeing has delayed 787 deliveries due to faulty horizontal stabilizers, and a whistleblower has argued that chronic fuselage gaps have left the entire 787 fleet in a position to fly apart at the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 737 Max has continued to have problems since the FAA took over inspection of that Boeing model, too. It was a 737 Max 9 which lost a door plug in flight last year. The FAA grounded 737 Max aircraft following the door plug incident, after which United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, the only carriers with Max 9s in their fleets, discovered a chronic problem of loose bolts on the questionably-airworthy aircraft. A Congressional look at internal Boeing documents found emails from engineers saying in 2020 that they wouldn't put their own families on the 737 Max over safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FAA gave Boeing 90 days to fix a number of safety shortcomings it flagged in a February 2024 report it published following the door plug blowout. It's well past that 90-day deadline, but the FAA now says that they're at least partially content with improvements the company has made since it started scrutinizing the firm, again, last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airworthiness certification custody sharing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The FAA will only allow this step forward because we are confident it can be done safely," the agency said in its Friday press release – but being done safely still means Boeing will be subject to FAA scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Per the Administration, Boeing will only get to issue airworthiness certificates every other week, with the FAA handling things the other half of the time. Far from being simply an acknowledgement that Boeing is doing better, the FAA is going to use its every-other-week model to spend more time keeping a watchful eye on the assembly process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By alternating weeks, we are creating more opportunities to directly observe how Boeing is carrying out this responsibility in practice," an FAA spokesperson told The Register.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boeing going backwards as production's slowing and woes keep flowing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boeing offloads some software businesses to private equiteer Thoma Bravo&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boeing's Starliner may fly again, pending fixes to literally everything&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Report claims FAA ignores most whistleblower complaints&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The FAA's role is to provide oversight of Boeing's performance, ensuring that it issues certificates only when airplanes meet all applicable safety requirements," the spokesperson continued. "Alternating weeks strengthens our ability to identify trends, intervene early if concerns arise, and maintain confidence in the overall safety of Boeing's system."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FAA didn't tell us whether the agreement was temporary, or how long it might take Boeing to earn its complete trust and confidence in its ability to issue reliable airworthiness certificates. Boeing didn't respond to questions for this story. ®&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Welcome to the online Awakening Bell, inspired by the teaching of Thich Nhat Hanh. Many people around the world take pleasure in stopping and consciously breathing in and out three times when they hear the sound of the bell. Click below for examples of the sound made by the big and the small bell. Either can be used by inputing a time interval, an exact time, or a random interval.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 3 months, I've interviewed 134 engineers - students, mid-level, seniors and even CTOs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main takeaway: there is a huge pool of exceptional junior engineers that most companies wonât even consider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While everyone else is fighting over seniors, smart companies can get a significant advantage by going the other direction. If you wonât, your competitors will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm not alone here. In the beginning of 2025 Shopify recently hired 25 interns (and their head of engineering said he aims for 1000(!) more by the end of the year, saying that: â...interns bring energy, drive and intensity that pushes the whole team forward.â)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why do companies avoid juniors?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every company has a different excuse:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In small startups - âwe are a very small team and we donât have time to mentor juniors, we need engineers who will be very productive from day 1"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In medium-sized companies - âwe are going to grow very fast, we need engineers who can handle scale and have faced such challenges before"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In big companies - âour infrastructure is super complex, itâll take juniors too long to ramp up".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's safer to hire someone with 4+ years of experience who can contribute from day one, even if their ceiling isn't as high as a motivated junior engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So colleges continue churning out graduates who can't get a job, while companies complain about how hard it is to find senior engineers (and pay premium rates for them).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is that many of these "experienced" hires aren't actually that much more productive than a well-mentored junior engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software development is not rocket science. There are diminishing returns, you will get better with time, but the pace will become slower. You can tell the difference between a developer with 1 year of experience and one with 5, but between those with 10 vs 15? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most critical parts (motivation, ambition, character, and brains) have little to do with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What companies are missing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main mistakes companies make:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Old assumptions about onboarding time. Companies assume junior engineers need 6-12 months to become productive, but AI-savvy juniors can get up to speed much faster. They can use it to understand codebases (without interrupting team members), generate boilerplate code, and learn new technologies at an accelerated pace.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Outdated interviews - most technical interviews still focus on algorithm memorization and whiteboard coding. These skills are less relevant when AI can handle all those known problems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They don't know where to find amazing juniors - companies recruit from the same places and miss the hidden gems. A perfect example: engineers who applied to Y Combinator but didn't get in. They are very often impressive people with strong motivation and drive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I share my take on junior interviews, letâs talk about whatâs so great about them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why I love working with juniors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Juniors are not restricted by what they know. They haven't been trained to think "that's just how we do things." Theyâll not try to reuse the same technologies from previous companies, or recreate those âamazingâ design patterns that were useful only in a specific context. Itâs not just being AI-native, itâs about having less resistance to change.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Great juniors learn fast and search for feedback. Itâs easier to manage them. They want to improve and know what you think about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Loyalty. engineers who you train from the beginning tend to stay longer. They understand your systems deeply and can mentor the next generation of junior engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Higher ceiling. A motivated junior engineer often has more upside. You're getting someone at the beginning of their growth curve rather than the middle or end.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juniors bring fresh energy to the team - they want to learn, and they have a drive to prove themselves and succeed. Their motivation can be contagious!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The existing seniors in your team will enjoy working with smart and motivated developers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we continue, a side note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The argument here is not to stop hiring seniors. To be effective, juniors need people to mentor them, do high quality code reviews, and so on. And in addition, for some critical challenges, you would still want people whoâve done those before at other places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so youâve decided itâs worth giving some juniors a chance. Now comes the hard part. As there are so many juniors looking for a job, it can be difficult to find the right ones. Hereâs the process that worked for us:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to hire the right junior engineers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most companies are still hiring like it's 2019. AI has fundamentally changed how we write software. If your hiring process hasn't changed, you're probably hiring the wrong people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, companies still ban AI during technical interviews. They're optimizing for skills that matter less while ignoring the skills that actually determine success on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs our hiring process in 5 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;1. Filter for the right mindset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask about projects they've built, then drill deeper. Ask "Why did you build this?" and "How does that work?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Keep drilling down until you hit the bottom of their understanding and whether they can think through complex problems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look for passion and curiosity. You want the ones who light up when talking about their projects. They should show real excitement about the problems they've solved. These conversations should be energizing for both of you!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Watch out for red flags. The ones who get defensive when you ask follow-up questions or can't explain their work past the surface level are probably just chasing a tech salary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;2. âUse whatever tools you like" home assignment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small and realistic coding challenge with explicit permission to use any tools they want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key is what happens next - we schedule a 30-minute follow-up where they walk through their solution. We ask them to explain their approach, then drill deeper on their reasoning - asking "Why did you make that choice?" or "how does this part work?". We keep going until you reach the limits of their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do they understand the code they submitted? Can they explain design decisions and trade-offs? How deep is their knowledge of the technologies they chose?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;3. Problem solving without AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ~40-minute interview to test their ability to think through complex problems and design solutions. We focus on system design, architectural decisions, and reasoning through trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, they will use AI in their job even in those tasks, but we also want to see if they can think for themselves, and what is their fundamental engineering thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;4. Live implementation with AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We give them 20 minutes for a small live coding task and see how they work with AI tools. Their prompting strategies, how they iterate on AI output, and whether they can effectively guide the AI toward solutions that make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;5. Evaluate their AI strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we ask candidates to walk us through their typical development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ask them to explain when they choose AI assistance versus manual coding, ideally with specific examples from projects they've built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineers who canât think without AI hit walls when they encounter new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ones who resist AI are outpaced by peers who go all-in with the new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We look for engineers who excel in both phases - the ones who understand the huge benefit AI provides, but also know where it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making it work after the hire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congrats! Youâve hired a new junior engineer. Whatâs next?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs my take:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in mentoring infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Donât just assume they can use AI to learn everything. Make sure your experienced engineers have the time to pair with them, create clear learning paths, and be available for their needs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be patient with short-term productivity. Donât expect them to produce magic because they are âAI-nativeâ. Yes, they should be fast, but give them the proper time to learn the basics of your company.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Measure the right metrics. Track how quickly junior engineers become productive, their retention rates, and their main blockers. We (very objectively) suggest using Weave to benchmark them to your current engineers and industry standards :)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Talk to them! Ask them about their experience, and what they think you could improve for the next juniors. Use the fresh perspective they bring, and come with an open mind to their suggestions. Also - make sure to appreciate their work and tell them when you do. Even if they are superstars - they might not know it, and could use some encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start small. Don't hire 10 juniors and let them run amok on your codebases. Start with 1-2 and learn what works (from the previous steps) before scaling up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters more than ever&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe most companies are making a huge mistake by avoiding juniors entirely. They're missing out on AI-native engineers who can learn quickly, adapt to new tools, and grow into really exceptional senior engineers quite fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This market inefficiency won't last forever. As weâve seen with the Shopify example, smart companies will figure out how to hire and develop junior engineers effectively. They will build incredible teams while their competitors fight over the same pool of expensive senior talent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing your time in passionate junior developers will pay off in the long run. The question is whether you'll start now or wait until everyone else figures it out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's September 2025. We have Claude Opus 4.1. GPT-5. Nano banana. There has never been a better time in the history of computing to build software. Here are a few ideas I wish existed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A camera app that uses nano banana to make my mediocre iPhone photos look like they were taken on a Leica.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A single-purpose AI agent that can take any frontend project and automatically add support for light mode, dark mode, and custom theming. It should be able to use vision to see the UI changes, and then iteratively make changes based on the rendered UI.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Another single-purpose AI agent that can decompile and debug minified code into an interpretable codebase. This also requires a strong code-then-debug loop.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A hybrid of Strong (the lifting app) and ChatGPT where the model has access to my workouts, can suggest improvements, and coach me. I mainly just want to be able to chat with the model knowing it has detailed context for each of my workouts (down to the time in between each set).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A recommendation engine that looks at my browsing history, sees what blog posts or articles I spent the most time on, then searches the web every night for things I should be reading that I’m not. In the morning I should get a digest of links. I also want to be able to give feedback on which were good suggestions and which weren’t to improve the next day’s digest.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A calorie tracking app that’s a chat app grounded by nutrition databases. Just minimize the cognitive effort it takes me to log a meal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A minimalist writing app that lets me write long-form content. A model can also highlight passages and leave me comments in the marginalia. I should be able to set different “personas” to review what I wrote.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An AI agent that can build one-off specialized AI agents. I want to describe a task like “build me an agent that can decompile code” and this agent will go off and build a hyper-specialized code decompilation agent for me.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A minimalist ebook reader that lets me read ebooks, but I can highlight passages and have the model explain things in more depth off to the side. It should also take on the persona of the author. It should feel like an extension of the book and not a separate chat instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Deep Research agent that can reason for multiple days. I want to give it very complex queries and let it know it can spawn hundreds of sub-agents and reason for 3 days before it needs to return a response.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A paint-by-number filmmaking app. I want to be able to brainstorm an idea for a short film in the app, have the model create a detailed storyboard, and then I just need to use my phone to film each of the storyboarded shots. Kind of like training wheels for making movies.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A local screen recording app but it uses local models to create detailed semantic summaries of what I’m doing each day on my computer. This should then be provided as context for a chat app. I want to ask things like “Who did I forget to respond to yesterday?” I've been using Rewind for a year now, and it's nowhere near as useful as it should be.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Semantic filters for Twitter/X/YouTube. I want to be able to write open-ended filters like “hide any tweet that will likely make me angry” and never have my feed show me rage-bait again. By shaping our feeds we shape ourselves.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An agent that can create a detailed curriculum for very niche topics. I should be able to say something like “I want to learn everything we know about the science of progress” and it would search the web for people, blog posts, YouTube videos, essays, and textbooks. Then it should read through all the content, and give me a guided curriculum that will take me from beginner to expert.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An actually good book recommendation engine that first quizzes you about things you’ve read in the past, what your goals are, and the sort of things you enjoy reading. Then once it knows a lot about you, another agent simulates what you might think of the books the main agent suggests. It only surfaces books that you’re very likely to enjoy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A semantic search engine for TikTok and Instagram Reels. There’s so much useful information locked away in short-form videos. I want to be able to query it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A sleep fitness app that pulls in data from my Apple Watch (HR, VO₂), Eight Sleep, Oura Ring, workout apps, and combines them to give me practical recommendations for how to improve my sleep and recovery. I want it to proactively message me. Something like “I noticed your HRV has gone down this week, maybe you’re overtraining?”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A massive component library designed to be rendered within the context of a chat interface. Most existing component libraries have primitives that are too low-level. Less customization, more high level widgets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A minimal voice assistant for my Apple Watch. I have lots of questions that are too complicated for Siri but not for ChatGPT. The responses should just be a few words long.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A writing app that searches the web for the topic you’re writing about, then composes a “suggested reading” list based on what it thinks might be helpful for you to read. (Writing apps should never write for you.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A running app that creates a personalized plan, tracks your running pace and heart rate, and then iteratively adjusts the training program based on real world data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A nano banana photo-editing app where I don’t have to write a prompt. Just give me hundreds of templates from trying out different haircuts to seeing what you and your partner’s kid would look like to making me look like The Rock. A photo editing super-app.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Same.energy but for finding YouTube videos with similar vibes. Let me put in a URL and have it find similar videos. YouTube's algorithm today is not this. It just tries to maximize the median user’s engagement.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A Sony Walkman-style device that you can give to children so they can ask questions to an LLM. It should be voice-first, and focused on explaining things. There shouldn’t be a single screen on the device. Offline-first would be a plus.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A search engine for biographies of people where the query is a questionnaire about the current problem you’re facing, your stage in life, your field, etc. The engine’s results should be chapters from biographies or autobiographies from great people throughout history who have gone through and written about similar circumstances.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A screen-recording agent that observes how I’m using my computer and phone. Each day it audits the content I’ve been consuming. Screen Time is not specific enough. I want to know the exact nutritional value of the tokens I’m consuming.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A marketplace for AI agents. I don’t think today’s general agents will be better than an agent designed for a specific use case. I want a hyper-specific agent catalog for niche tasks like finding an apartment to rent in San Francisco. There should be tens of thousands of these agents that I can use via the web or call via API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A writing app that lets you “request a critique” from a bunch of famous writers. What would Hemingway say about this blog post? What did he find confusing? What did he like?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're building anything on this list, please let me know. I'd really like to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
