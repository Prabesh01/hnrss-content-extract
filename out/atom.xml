    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Many Hard Leetcode Problems are Easy Constraint Problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use the right tool for the job.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first interview out of college I was asked the change counter problem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given number. IE for USA coinage and 37 cents, the minimum number is four (quarter, dime, 2 pennies).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented the simple greedy algorithm and immediately fell into the trap of the question: the greedy algorithm only works for "well-behaved" denominations. If the coin values were &lt;code&gt;[10, 9, 1]&lt;/code&gt;, then making 37 cents would take 10 coins in the greedy algorithm but only 4 coins optimally (&lt;code&gt;10+9+9+9&lt;/code&gt;). The "smart" answer is to use a dynamic programming algorithm, which I didn't know how to do. So I failed the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you only need dynamic programming if you're writing your own algorithm. It's really easy if you throw it into a constraint solver like MiniZinc and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int: total;
array[int] of int: values = [10, 9, 1];
array[index_set(values)] of var 0..: coins;

constraint sum (c in index_set(coins)) (coins[c] * values[c]) == total;
solve minimize sum(coins);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try this online here. It'll give you a prompt to put in &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; and then give you successively-better solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;coins = [0, 0, 37];
----------
coins = [0, 1, 28];
----------
coins = [0, 2, 19];
----------
coins = [0, 3, 10];
----------
coins = [0, 4, 1];
----------
coins = [1, 3, 0];
----------
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of similar interview questions are this kind of mathematical optimization problem, where we have to find the maximum or minimum of a function corresponding to constraints. They're hard in programming languages because programming languages are too low-level. They are also exactly the problems that constraint solvers were designed to solve. Hard leetcode problems are easy constraint problems.1 Here I'm using MiniZinc, but you could just as easily use Z3 or OR-Tools or whatever your favorite generalized solver is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a question in a different interview (which I thankfully passed):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given a list of stock prices through the day, find maximum profit you can get by buying one stock and selling one stock later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easy to do in O(n^2) time, or if you are clever, you can do it in O(n). Or you could be not clever at all and just write it as a constraint problem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
var int: buy;
var int: sell;
var int: profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];

constraint sell &amp;gt; buy;
constraint profit &amp;gt; 0;
solve maximize profit;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder, link to trying it online here. While working at that job, one interview question we tested out was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given a list, determine if three numbers in that list can be added or subtracted to give 0?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a satisfaction problem, not a constraint problem: we don't need the "best answer", any answer will do. We eventually decided against it for being too tricky for the engineers we were targeting. But it's not tricky in a solver;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;include "globals.mzn";
array[int] of int: numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array[index_set(numbers)] of var {0, -1, 1}: choices;

constraint sum(n in index_set(numbers)) (numbers[n] * choices[n]) = 0;
constraint count(choices, -1) + count(choices, 1) = 3;
solve satisfy;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, one last one, a problem I saw last year at Chipy AlgoSIG. Basically they pick some leetcode problems and we all do them. I failed to solve this one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "proper" solution is a tricky thing involving tracking lots of bookkeeping states, which you can completely bypass by expressing it as constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;array[int] of int: numbers = [2,1,5,6,2,3];

var 1..length(numbers): x; 
var 1..length(numbers): dx;
var 1..: y;

constraint x + dx &amp;lt;= length(numbers);
constraint forall (i in x..(x+dx)) (y &amp;lt;= numbers[i]);

var int: area = (dx+1)*y;
solve maximize area;

output ["(\(x)-&amp;gt;\(x+dx))*\(y) = \(area)"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's even a way to automatically visualize the solution (using &lt;code&gt;vis_geost_2d&lt;/code&gt;), but I didn't feel like figuring it out in time for the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is this better?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if I actually brought these questions to an interview the interviewee could ruin my day by asking "what's the runtime complexity?" Constraint solvers runtimes are unpredictable and almost always slower than an ideal bespoke algorithm because they are more expressive, in what I refer to as the capability/tractability tradeoff. But even so, they'll do way better than a bad bespoke algorithm, and I'm not experienced enough in handwriting algorithms to consistently beat a solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real advantage of solvers, though, is how well they handle new constraints. Take the stock picking problem above. I can write an O(n²) algorithm in a few minutes and the O(n) algorithm if you give me some time to think. Now change the problem to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maximize the profit by buying and selling up to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;max_sales&lt;/code&gt;stocks, but you can only buy or sell one stock at a given time and you can only hold up to&lt;code&gt;max_hold&lt;/code&gt;stocks at a time?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a way harder problem to write even an inefficient algorithm for! While the constraint problem is only a tiny bit more complicated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;include "globals.mzn";
int: max_sales = 3;
int: max_hold = 2;
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array [1..max_sales] of var int: buy;
array [1..max_sales] of var int: sell;
array [index_set(prices)] of var 0..max_hold: stocks_held;
var int: profit = sum(s in 1..max_sales) (prices[sell[s]] - prices[buy[s]]);

constraint forall (s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] &amp;gt; buy[s]);
constraint profit &amp;gt; 0;

constraint forall(i in index_set(prices)) (stocks_held[i] = (count(s in 1..max_sales) (buy[s] &amp;lt;= i) - count(s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] &amp;lt;= i)));
constraint alldifferent(buy ++ sell);
solve maximize profit;

output ["buy at \(buy)\n", "sell at \(sell)\n", "for \(profit)"];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most constraint solving examples online are puzzles, like Sudoku or "SEND + MORE = MONEY". Solving leetcode problems would be a more interesting demonstration. And you get more interesting opportunities to teach optimizations, like symmetry breaking.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re announcing the OpenAI Grove, a new program for technical talent at the very start of their company-building journey. The Grove is not a startup accelerator or traditional program: it offers pre-idea individuals deeply curious about building in AI a dense talent network, co-building with OpenAI researchers, and resources designed to accelerate your journey. As participants explore early concepts, they will receive counsel from the OpenAI team and community with peers in OpenAI Grove. &lt;lb/&gt;This program is the starting point of a long-term network. It will begin with five weeks of content and programming hosted in the OpenAI San Francisco HQ, including in-person workshops, weekly office hours, and mentoring from OpenAI technical leaders. In addition to technical support and community, participants will also have the opportunity to get hands-on with new OpenAI tools and models prior to general availability. Following the program, participants will be able to explore raising capital or pursue another avenue, internally or externally to OpenAI. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first Grove cohort will consist of approximately fifteen participants. We recommend individuals from all backgrounds, disciplines, and experience levels apply. To apply, please submit the form below by September 24th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications are due by September 24th, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Joining the qgis-users mailing list&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chatting with other users real-time. Please wait around for a response to your question as many folks on the channel are doing other things and it may take a while for them to notice your question. The following paths all take you to the same chat room: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Using an IRC client and joining the #qgis channel on irc.libera.chat.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Using a Matrix client and joining the #qgis:osgeo.org room.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At the GIS stackexchange or r/QGIS reddit, which are not maintained by the QGIS team, but where the QGIS and broader GIS community provides lots of advice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Other support channels&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How FOSS Projects Handle Legal Takedown Requests&lt;/head&gt;Posted on Sep 10, 2025 by F-Droid&lt;p&gt;When a legal takedown request arrives, whether itâs about copyright, censorship, privacy, or something more vague, how a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project responds can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handled well, a takedown request can be a manageable administrative step. Handled poorly, it can cause panic, disrupt infrastructure, or even put contributors at legal risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Pattern Emerges&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite differences in jurisdiction, size, and mission, a few common themes from our research emerged when we asked how other projects handle takedown requests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Donât Be a Soft Target&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal threats often follow the path of least resistance. FOSS projects that publish a formal takedown policy, require legal submissions through specific channels, and insist on a valid legal basis are much less likely to receive, or comply with, vague or harassing demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One FOSS organization, for example, requires all legal correspondence to be submitted by postal mail in the national language and citing local law. Most complaints evaporate once asked to comply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Creating a transparent and documented process&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several digital rights organizations advised setting up structured response steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Require submissions to a dedicated legal@ or abuse@ email.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Insist on full documentation: legal basis, jurisdiction, evidence of the infringement and identity of the complainant.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Review for sufficiency, proportionality, and standing before acting.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates proper documentation to process valid claims, while protecting projects from illegitimate or unfounded requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Use Jurisdiction Strategically&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects based in civil law jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, are often better positioned to deflect legal demands from foreign entities. Several organizations emphasized that complying with vague or extrajudicial requests, especially those originating outside your jurisdiction, can increase risk unnecessarily. Instead, they recommended requiring a valid legal basis grounded in the projectâs home country. Formal legal processes, such as court orders or official government channels, were seen as the appropriate threshold, not informal emails or unverifiable demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notification and Appeals: Fairness and Transparency&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the projects we consulted emphasized the importance of notifying developers whose apps are being targeted, informing them (if possible) of the seriousness of the claim, and the proposed strategy F-Droid is taking to handle the claim.Â&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a threat is deemed to be valid and a developerâs content is flagged for takedown:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The developer or maintainer is informed, unless prohibited by law (gag orders).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A window for response (commonly 14 days) is offered, unless unfeasible due to seriousness and time restraints of the request itself&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If the developer disputes the claim and provides supporting information (e.g. license, public domain status, fair use justification), the claim is reviewed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If the claim is upheld, the content is removed, but always with an internal record and opportunity to appeal.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mirrors principles embedded in international norms (like the Manila Principles and GitHubâs DMCA takedown policy) and avoids overcompliance with weak or abusive claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Transparency, Censorship, and What You Can (Legally) Publish&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takedown requests occupy a complex space between legal enforcement and censorship. While some are legitimate claims, like copyright violations or privacy breaches, others are vague, politically motivated, or intended to silence dissent. For FOSS projects that have a global user base, itâs not always obvious how to respond. Complying too quickly can reinforce censorship practices; resisting without process can lead to full website shut downs, domain names being taken away (as in the US) or large and costly legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One strategy that helps balance this tension is radical transparency. Several projects we spoke with emphasized the importance of documenting what actions were taken and why, not just for accountability, but as a form of resistance. A well-known example is GitHubâs DMCA takedown policy (as of July 2025), which mandates compliance with valid takedown requests, but also posts each one publicly in their github/dmca repository. The result: potential abusers know their requests will face public scrutiny, which acts as a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all jurisdictions allow this kind of transparency. In India, for example, we were informed that it is often illegal to disclose that you have received a government request, even to the developer of the affected app. In contrast, in Russia, takedown requests can often be legally posted, though by doing so you may be putting yourself at risk for retaliation, additional takedown requests and legal troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, some best practices for FOSS projects include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Publishing biannual transparency reports, even if redacted or aggregated.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Maintaining an internal log of all takedown activity, with public disclosure where legally possible.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Explaining the general reasons for content removals, who made the request, under what law, and what action was taken, unless legally prohibited.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Being explicit about what cannot be shared, and why.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency wonât prevent all forms of censorship, but it can slow them down, raise awareness, and provide a record that strengthens the broader FOSS ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Weâre Doing at F-Droid&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;F-Droid is revising its own takedown policy, informed by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Dutch law and EU regulations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The structural support provided by The Commons Conservancy&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Practical lessons from long-standing FOSS organizations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our draft process includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Written takedown submission request to legal@f-droid.org including the required information.:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Identify the specific material in question (e.g. app name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Include valid legal basis under applicable jurisdiction (e.g. copyright law, court order statutory basis)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Indicate jurisdiction in which the legal basis is claimed to apply&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Include sufficient evidence of the alleged infringement (e.g. copyright certificate, ownership declaration)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Clearly state that the complaintant is authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Include full contact details and a verifiable identity (subject to exceptions, such as gag orders or whistleblower protection)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Verification of jurisdiction and legal basis, including evidence&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Developer notification and appeal procedures&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rejection of requests lacking documentation or legal authority may be rejected or ignored&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Biannual transparency reports and public tracking of takedown requests&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weâre also working to improve contributor education about potential exposure when contributing to F-Droid, document internal escalation paths, and ensure consistent handling of international claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takedown requests are not going away in fact, theyâre becoming more frequent and more complex. But FOSS projects donât have to face them unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building processes, establishing clear jurisdiction, and protecting individuals through structure and policy, we can handle these challenges with the seriousness they deserve without letting them derail our mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Legal Disclaimer&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content provided in this article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;EU Court Rules Nuclear Energy is Clean Energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WePlanet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5 minutes ago&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 min read&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I launched Dear Greenpeace with my fellow youth climate activists alongside WePlanet two years ago, I had no idea just how quickly the anti-nuclear dominoes would fall across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, and what seems like a lifetime ago, Austria launched their legal action against the European Commission for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. At the time they were supported by a bulwark of EU countries and environmental NGOs that opposed nuclear energy. Honestly, it looked like they might win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But today, that whole landscape has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Germany, long a symbol of anti-nuclear politics, is beginning to shift. The nuclear phase-outs or bans in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Italy are now history. Even Fridays for Future has quietened its opposition, and in some places, embraced nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This moment matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It shows what’s possible when we stick to the science. The evidence only gets clearer by the day that nuclear energy has an extremely low environmental impact across its lifecycle, and strong regulations and safety culture ensure that it remains one of the safest forms of energy available to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Court of Justice has now fully dismissed Austria’s lawsuit. That ruling doesn’t just uphold nuclear energy’s place in EU green finance rules. It also signals a near-certain defeat for the ongoing Greenpeace case – the very lawsuit that inspired me to launch Dear Greenpeace in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But instead of learning from this, Greenpeace is doubling down. Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, called the court decision “a dark day for the climate”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let that sink in. The highest court in the EU just reaffirmed that nuclear energy meets the scientific and environmental standards to be included in sustainable finance, and Greenpeace still refuses to budge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the climate crisis gets worse. Global emissions are not falling fast enough. Billions of people still lack access to clean, reliable electricity. And we are forced to spend time defending proven solutions instead of scaling them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s now up to the court whether we will get our time in court to outline the evidence in support of nuclear energy and the important role it can play in the global clean energy transition. Whether in court, on the streets, or in the halls of parliaments across the globe, we will be there to defend the science and ensure that nuclear power can spread the advantages of the modern world across the planet in a sustainable, reliable and dignified way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Austria stands increasingly isolated among a handful of countries that still cling to their opposition to nuclear energy. Their defeat in this vital high stakes topic is a success not just for the nuclear movement, but for the global transition as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have made real progress. Together, we’ve helped defend nuclear power in the EU, overturned outdated policies at the World Bank, and secured more technology-neutral language at the UN. These wins are not abstract. They open the door to real investment, real projects, and real emissions cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the work is not done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We still need to overturn national nuclear bans, unlock more funding, and push democratic countries to support clean energy development abroad: especially where it is most needed to compete with Russia’s growing influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fight will not be done until every single country in the world can boast a clean, reliable energy grid, ready to maintain a modern dignified standard of living, for everyone, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a great success for the movement and it would not have been possible without the financial support, time and energy given by people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Solidarity, Ia Aanstoot&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time I learned about UTF-8 encoding, I was fascinated by how well-thought and brilliantly it was designed to represent millions of characters from different languages and scripts, and still be backward compatible with ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically UTF-8 uses 32 bits and the old ASCII uses 7 bits, but UTF-8 is designed in such a way that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every ASCII encoded file is a valid UTF-8 file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every UTF-8 encoded file that has only ASCII characters is a valid ASCII file.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing a system that scales to millions of characters and still be compatible with the old systems that use just 128 characters is a brilliant design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: If you are already aware of the UTF-8 encoding, you can explore the UTF-8 Playground utility that I built to visualize UTF-8 encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Does UTF-8 Do It?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding designed to represent every character in the Unicode character set, encompassing characters from most of the world's writing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It encodes characters using one to four bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first 128 characters (&lt;code&gt;U+0000&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;U+007F&lt;/code&gt;) are encoded with a single byte, ensuring backward compatibility with ASCII, and this is the reason why a file with only ASCII characters is a valid UTF-8 file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other characters require two, three, or four bytes. The leading bits of the first byte determine the total number of bytes that represents the current character. These bits follow one of four specific patterns, which indicate how many continuation bytes follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;1st byte Pattern&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;# of bytes used&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Full byte sequence pattern&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0xxxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0xxxxxxx&lt;p&gt;(This is basically a regular ASCII encoded byte)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;110xxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;110xxxxx 10xxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1110xxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11110xxx&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the second, third, and fourth bytes in a multi-byte sequence always start with 10. This indicates that these bytes are continuation bytes, following the main byte.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining bits in the main byte, along with the bits in the continuation bytes, are combined to form the character's code point. A code point serves as a unique identifier for a character in the Unicode character set. A code point is typically represented in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "U+". For example, the code point for the character "A" is &lt;code&gt;U+0041&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here is how a software determines the character from the UTF-8 encoded bytes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read a byte. If it starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaiing 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the byte didn't start with a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, then:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;code&gt;110&lt;/code&gt;, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;code&gt;1110&lt;/code&gt;, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;code&gt;11110&lt;/code&gt;, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If it starts with &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read the next byte and repeat the process.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example: Hindi Letter "अ" (open in UTF-8 Playground)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hindi letter "अ" (officially "Devanagari Letter A") is represented in UTF-8 as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;11100000 10100100 10000101 Here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first byte 11100000 indicates that the character is encoded using 3 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining bits of the three bytes: xxxx0000 xx100100 xx000101 are combined to form the binary sequence 00001001 00000101 (&lt;code&gt;0x0905&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal). This is the code point of the character, represented as &lt;code&gt;U+0905&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code point &lt;code&gt;U+0905&lt;/code&gt; (see official chart) represents the Hindi letter "अ" in the Unicode character set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example Text Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we understood the design of UTF-8, let's look at a file that contains the following text:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Text file contains: &lt;code&gt;Hey👋 Buddy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text &lt;code&gt;Hey👋 Buddy&lt;/code&gt; has both English characters and an emoji character on it. The text file with this text saved on the disk will have the following 13 bytes in it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;01001000 01100101 01111001 11110000 10011111 10010001 10001011 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Byte&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Explanation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01001000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1001000&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11110000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;11110&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's the first byte of a four-byte character.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10011111&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's a continuation byte.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10010001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's a continuation byte.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10001011&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, indicating it's a continuation byte.&lt;p&gt;The bits from these four bytes (excluding the leading bits) combine to form the binary sequence 00001 11110100 01001011, which is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1F44B&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal, corresponds to the code point &lt;code&gt;U+1F44B&lt;/code&gt;. This code point represents the waving hand emoji "👋" in the Unicode character set (open in playground).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;00100000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;0100000&lt;/code&gt; represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01000010&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1000010&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01110101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1110101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now this is a valid UTF-8 file, but it doesn't have to be "backward compatible" with ASCII because it contains a non-ASCII character (the emoji). Next let's create a file that contains only ASCII characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Text file contains: &lt;code&gt;Hey Buddy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text file doesn't have any non-ASCII characters. The file saved on the disk has the following 9 bytes in it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;01001000 01100101 01111001 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Byte&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Explanation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01001000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1001000&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;00100000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;0100000&lt;/code&gt; represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01000010&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1000010&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01110101&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1110101&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01100100&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1100100&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;01111001&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Starts with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits &lt;code&gt;1111001&lt;/code&gt; represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this is a valid UTF-8 file, and it is also a valid ASCII file. The bytes in this file follows both the UTF-8 and ASCII encoding rules. This is how UTF-8 is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other Encodings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a quick research on any other encoding that are backward compatible with ASCII, and there are a few, but they are not as popular as UTF-8, for example GB 18030 (a Chinese government standard). Another one is the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings are single-byte encodings that extend ASCII to include additional characters, but they are limited to 256 characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The siblings of UTF-8, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, are not backward compatible with ASCII. For example, the letter 'A' in UTF-16 is represented as: &lt;code&gt;00 41&lt;/code&gt; (two bytes), while in UTF-32 it is represented as: &lt;code&gt;00 00 00 41&lt;/code&gt; (four bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus: UTF-8 Playground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was exploring the UTF-8 encoding, I couldn't find any good tool to interactively visualize how UTF-8 encoding works. So I built UTF-8 Playground to visualize and play around with UTF-8 encoding. Give it a try!.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Emacs: a paradigm shift&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I read this beginners guide to extend Emacs. The guide is perfect for starting out with elisp and it shows a lot of care in teaching how to interact with Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, the most important bit though is this one, from the section aptly named Emacs Wants You to Extend It.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I havenât written plugins for other editors extensively, but I can tell you this: emacs doesnât just make deep customization available, but it actively encourages you to make an absolute customization messes masterpieces. Core editor functions arenât just documented, but often include tidbits about âyou probably want to see this other variableâ or âhereâs how you should use thisâ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but emacs happily hands you functions shaped like nuclear warheads like advice-add (that let you override any function) that can absolutely obliterate your editor if you hold it the wrong way. Of course, this also grants you unlimited power.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember that emacs is designed to be torn apart and rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the core bit of the argument. Emacs, as a system, wants you to extend it and it gives you all the means to do so. This is in contrast with systems that can be extended through scripting and instead donât give you all the means to do so!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the tutorial is a fantastic example of doing things right. There is a well-thought example, a constructive approach where the solution grows to a full package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is problematic. You may get the impression that extending Emacs is only possible if you do things right and that is definitely not true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make my point I want to walk you through an example. I will show you how I used standard Emacs extension-points to extend org-mode to sort my reading lists automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What do I want?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The behavior I want is that when I save an org file the entries are ordered automatically. I keep a timeline of the papers I am reading and it is annoying to keep them kind of ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the content of an example buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I add a paper to my reading list I run &lt;code&gt;org-sort-entries&lt;/code&gt; and
interactively select to order the entries by the value in the property
&lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt;. Initally this was nice to have but now itâs just annoying that
I have to keep doing it. Letâs extend org-mode so that this is done automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A simple solution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to automate the interactive part. Lucky for me this is easy as &lt;code&gt;org-sort-entries&lt;/code&gt; is both a function and a command. I can call it in a
script just as I can run it as a command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This solves one part of the problem. Letâs solve the other one, automatically calling &lt;code&gt;org-sort-run&lt;/code&gt; whenever an org-mode buffer is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emacs already has support for this use-case through the use of hooks. We can run &lt;code&gt;org-sort-run&lt;/code&gt; all the times we want to save a buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two together solve the problem but the solution presented is âjust more codeâ. We tapped into the hook extension point but this would be possible in any scriptable system that exposes well-defined extension points such as hooks and commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Leveraging Emacsâ extensibility to extend org-mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to show that even if something is not thought with extensibility in mind Emacs allow us to extend it. Most importantly, while we want to extend org-modeâs behavior we would like this not to be an extension to org-modeâs code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs the updated problem statement. Have the buffer be automatically sorted and have the sorting criteria be in the buffer itself. We will specify the sorting as a in-buffer setting and use Emacs to support this never thought before org-mode behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our example buffer changes to the following.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard part of this is to find how org-mode reads in-buffer settings from the header. A M-x find-library later we are in orgâs sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching for &lt;code&gt;+STARTUP&lt;/code&gt; (Ctrl+s +STARTUP), one of the
supported settings, leads us to &lt;code&gt;org-startup-folded&lt;/code&gt; and that in turn
(Ctrl+s org-startup-folded) leads us to &lt;code&gt;org-startup-options&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;org-startup-options&lt;/code&gt; is the used by (again Ctrl+s org-startup-option)
&lt;code&gt;org-set-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the documentation for this function is not very convincing, its code does make sense for what we are after. I copied it here for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this function calls &lt;code&gt;org-collect-keyword&lt;/code&gt; with a list that we cannot
touch. There is no custom variable to set to pass our own keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this was a ânormal programming environmentâ we would make our changes to this function body and forever maintain a fork of org-mode. As this is elisp instead we have choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the best choice is to use &lt;code&gt;advice-add&lt;/code&gt; and have Emacs call our
advice code every time &lt;code&gt;org-set-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt; is called. We will copy
what we need from the function body but that will be all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what I ended up with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We keep a buffer-local variable &lt;code&gt;org-sort-option&lt;/code&gt; around to store the
property name read from &lt;code&gt;#+SORT: property-name&lt;/code&gt;. This variable is initially
&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; and will be set from the property name in &lt;code&gt;#+SORT: property-name&lt;/code&gt;. To do so
we have a function &lt;code&gt;org-sort-set-option&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when to call &lt;code&gt;org-sort-set-option&lt;/code&gt;? The easy way out is to have Emacs call it whenever
&lt;code&gt;org-set-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt; is called on a file visit. To achieve this we
tap into &lt;code&gt;advice-add&lt;/code&gt; and ask Emacs to run &lt;code&gt;org-sort-set-option&lt;/code&gt; after
&lt;code&gt;org-sort-regexps-and-options&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have now succesfully interposed ourselves in the control flow of the org-mode library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Org-mode did not provide any interposition point for us, there is no thought ahead etension-point or configuration variable we can use to achieve our goal an yet here we are with a sorted buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We succeeded in our effort because Emacs wants you to extend it and it gives you all the means to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have made a horrible hack and it works. I have learnt nothing about how org-mode works or Emacsâ file-visiting extension-points.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 98 runs surprisingly well in QEMU via UTM SE, but it requires some care in setting it up. It’s a great way to run old 90s Windows and DOS software on your iPad (and Mac too, though you have other options available to you, or an iPhone if you don’t mind the HID difficulties).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post provides some suggestions and tips for installing Windows and selecting the best emulated devices. The guidance is intended for UTM users on Apple platforms, but should apply to anything QEMU based (or QEMU itself). The advice might also be useful for other operating systems in UTM/QEMU as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Plug and play BIOS issues (or: how to install with ACPI)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install Windows 9x, PCI devices might be broken, and you’ll see a Plug and Play BIOS device with problems in the device manager:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems to be a bug in SeaBIOS or QEMU; I haven’t yet seen an issue tracking this. Many guides (i.e. this one or this one) suggest changing the device and hoping devices re-enumerate correctly. However, there’s a simpler method available when using Windows 98 SE. (If you’re using Windows 95, you won’t be able to do this.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 98 can use ACPI to enumerate devices instead of the legacy PnP BIOS. Unfortunately, it doesn’t use ACPI by default. (There seems to be an allowlist of known good ACPI BIOSes, as it was early days for ACPI.) To make it use ACPI anyways, boot with CD-ROM support from the Windows 98 CD instead of running the installer, then run Windows setup with the &lt;code&gt;/p j&lt;/code&gt; flag, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C:\&amp;gt; D:
D:\&amp;gt; cd WIN98
D:\WIN98&amp;gt; setup /p j&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible to convert an existing system to ACPI, but it’s much easier to do this from the start. When Windows is installed this way, it should correctly enumerate all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Device selection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;System&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QEMU can emulate devices Windows 98 supports out of the box, which is good as there are no VirtIO drivers. Make sure you’re using the i440-based “&lt;code&gt;pc&lt;/code&gt;” rather than the Q35 based system, as it’ll be better supported for legacy systems. You don’t need to worry about selecting i386 vs. x86_64, as Windows 98 will obviously never touch 64-bit mode, so they’ll be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(As a tip, if you’re running NT 4, you’ll need to select a different CPU to make sure it’s happy with the CPU flags as the default one is too new. A Pentium II should be sufficiently old.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Input&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may need to disable USB (or at least, USB input devices) to avoid hanging on startup, at least with UTM (It’s possible the ‘Force PS/2 Controller’ option might work, but I haven’t had much luck with it. Unfortunately, this means you won’t have absolute mouse input (through the USB tablet) and must capture your cursor. With UTM SE on an iPad, this doesn’t hurt as much, as it can automatically capture the trackpad or external mouse, while leaving the touchscreen for interacting with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most sensible video option for Windows 98 is the Cirrus VGA (&lt;code&gt;-vga cirrus&lt;/code&gt;). There are unfortunately some bugs (flashing in 16 bit colour modes, blitting issues in 8 bit colour modes), but it’s the only option with accelerated drivers out of the box. (Of course, there is no 3D acceleration with such a card.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently, Rage 128 emulation is being worked on (&lt;code&gt;ati-vga&lt;/code&gt;), but currently only works for Power Mac emulation, and is in rough shape so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Networking and getting files in&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For getting files into the VM easily, you’ll want a network. SLiRP NAT works fine for using a browser or SMB shares, for example. (Note this works better on Windows 98 than 95; 95 has issues with mounting SMB shares by IP and doesn’t come with a browser.) QEMU can emulate a variety of network cards. The tulip (DC2114x), NE2000 (PCI and ISA), and PCNet should all work out of the box with older Windows. I’d recommend using a PCI card if possible, since it saves you the ISA setup headache unless you need it for something old. If you do need to set up an ISA NE2000, it’s at address 300h, IRQ 9, which might require manual configuration in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sound&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sound hardware, there are a few options available, with different tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you want to run DOS software, the SoundBlaster 16 (&lt;code&gt;sb16&lt;/code&gt;) emulation works out of the box, but there is no OPL3 or MPU-401, so MIDI won’t work correctly, just PCM. Games will have a hard time with this unless they’re entirely PCM. For setting up your SB16 for DOS games, use&lt;code&gt;SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 T5&lt;/code&gt;(that’s address 220h, interrupt 5, 8-bit DMA 1, our non-existent MPU-401 at 330h, 16-bit DMA 5).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Note that QEMU supports adding an AdLib (OPL2 based) separately, which might help with some software.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CS4321A I haven’t tested, but might work with WSS or Crystal-specific drivers. As with the SoundBlaster 16, there is no OPL3. QEMU sets this up at 534h, IRQ 9, DMA 3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Gravis UltraSound (&lt;code&gt;gus&lt;/code&gt;) emulation works surprisingly well, but the Windows 95 drivers are crusty for the version of the card it emulates (GF1/GUS Classic), so use it only if you want to run old trackers or demoscene stuff. Note you may need to turn off the LPT port (&lt;code&gt;-parallel none&lt;/code&gt;) to free up an interrupt used for the UltraSound.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because of this, the ES1370 might be the best card to emulate for plain Windows usage, as it has relatively few quirks and I believe has drivers on the Windows 98 CD. However, it’s not ideal for DOS software as it requires TSRs to make it work right.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The AC97 emulation will require Realtek drivers. I haven’t tested this.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Potpourri&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In UTM, you may want to turn off the entropy device, to reduce unknown device clutter in Device Manager, though it’s harmless. The VirtIO console device will still be present in Device Manager with UTM’s default flags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other quirks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In UTM SE, sometimes rebooting might hang when switching video modes. If this happens, it seems safe to shut down the machine and start it again. Avoiding reboots in favour of shutting down seems wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance characteristics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While TCG in QEMU doesn’t have the best reputation for performance, it might be good enough for your needs. On my MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro, benchmarks show performance somewhat around about a 750 MHz Pentium III, albeit with worse floating point performance. This is pretty usable, although most 3D games won’t be usable as even software rendering will be a bit sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using UTM SE on iOS, the interpreter is slower, but not unusable for 90s software. On my M1 iPad Pro, I get Pentium 100 performance, with similar penalties for FP. This is good for games up to about 1995 or 1996; titles like MechWarrior 2, Widget Workshop, many edutainment titles, and SimCity 2000 are playable this way, though MIDI or CD music will be missing. Non-game software like Office 97 or Visual C++ will run fine, of course. For OSes, this also puts things like Windows 2000 and beyond just out of reach performance wise – stick with Windows 98 for the best compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Less is more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meow is yet another modal editing mode for Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meow aims to blend modal editing into Emacs with minimal interference with its original key-bindings, avoiding most of the hassle introduced by key-binding conflicts. This leads to lower necessary configuration and better integration. More is achieved with fewer commands to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key features compared to existing solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimal configuration – build your own modal editing system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No third-party dependencies (try it without touching your configuration)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Doesn’t occupy too many keys &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Much easier to remember for people trying modal editing&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;More keys available for your own key-bindings&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Most of the time, you don’t even need to hold shift!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lightning fast (unlike Evil)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimizes modifier usage (e.g. &lt;code&gt;SPC x f&lt;/code&gt;for&lt;code&gt;C-x C-f&lt;/code&gt;) inspired by god-mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better workflow for kmacro application at multiple locations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interactive selection manipulation and expansion inspired by avy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Selection as top-tier object, and keybindings built around selection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compatible with the vanilla Emacs keymap (or any other keymap from any package)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Effortless uniform keymaps across modes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Key-binding conflict handling made easy&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the third piece of the fourth part of our series (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb) looking at the lives of pre-modern peasant farmers – a majority of all of the humans who have ever lived. Last time, we started looking at the subsistence of peasant agriculture by considering the productivity of our model farming families under basically ideal conditions: relatively good yields and effectively infinite land.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week we’re going to start peeling back those assumptions in light of the very small farm-sizes and capital availability our pre-modern peasants had. Last week we found that, assuming effectively infinite land and reasonably high yields, our farmers produced enough to maintain their households fairly securely in relative comfort, with enough surplus over even their respectability needs to potentially support a small population of non-farmers. But of course land isn’t infinite and also isn’t free and on top of that, the societies in which our peasant farmers live are often built to extract as much surplus from the peasantry as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But first, if you like what you are reading, please share it and if you really like it, you can support this project on Patreon! While I do teach as the academic equivalent of a tenant farmer, tilling the Big Man’s classes, this project is my little plot of freeheld land which enables me to keep working as a writers and scholar. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on Twitter and Bluesky and (less frequently) Mastodon (@bretdevereaux@historians.social) for updates when posts go live and my general musings; I have largely shifted over to Bluesky (I maintain some de minimis presence on Twitter), given that it has become a much better place for historical discussion than Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Land Holdings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Returning to where we left off last week, we found that our model families could comfortably exceed their subsistence and ‘respectability’ needs with the labor they had assuming they had enough land (and other capital) to employ all of their available farming labor. However, attentive readers will have noticed that the labor of these families could work a lot of land: 30.5 acres for The Smalls, 33.6 acres for The Middles and 56 acres for The Biggs. That may not seem large by the standards of modern commercial farms, but few peasants had anything like such large landholdings; even rich peasants rarely owned so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We might compare, for instance, the land allotments of Macedonian and Greek military settlers in the Hellenistic kingdoms (particularly Egypt, where our evidence is good). These settlers were remarkably well compensated, because part of what the Hellenistic kings are trying to do is create a new class of Greco-Macedonian rentier-elites1 as a new ethnically defined military ruling-class which would support their new monarchies. In Egypt, where we can see most clearly, infantrymen generally received 25 or 30 arourai (17 or 20.4 acres), while cavalrymen, socially higher up still, generally received 100 arourai (68 acres).2 That infantry allotment is still anywhere from two thirds to less than half of what our model families can farm and yet was still large enough, as far as we can tell, to enable Ptolemaic Greco-Macedonian soldiers to live as rentier-elites, subsisting primarily if not entirely off of rents and the labor of others.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternately, considering late medieval Europe through the study of Saint-Thibery,4 out of 189 households in 1460 in the village just fifteen households are in the same neighborhood of landholdings as the Smalls’ 33.6 acres above (so roughly 55 setérée and up)5 only six as much as The Biggs (about 90 setérée and up). In short our assessment so far has assumed our families are extremely rich peasants. But of course they almost certainly are not!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, as we noted in our first part, the average size of peasant landholdings was extremely small. Typical Roman landholdings were around 5-10 iugera (3.12-6.23 acres), in wheat-farming pre-Han northern China roughly 100 mu (4.764 acres), in Ptolemaic Egypt (for the indigenous, non-elite population) probably 5-10 aroura (3.4-6.8 acres) and so on.6 In Saint-Thibery in Languedoc, the average (mean) farm size was about 24 setérée (~14.5 acres) but the more useful median farm size was just five setérée (~3 acres); the average is obviously quite distorted by the handful of households with hundreds of setérée of land.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we might test three different farm sizes; once again, I am going to use Roman units because that’s how I am doing my background math. We might posit a relatively a poor household farm of roughly three iugera (1.85 acres). In Saint-Thibery, 68 of the 189 households (36%) had land holdings this small or smaller, so this is not an unreasonable ‘poor household’ – indeed, we could posit much poorer, but then we’re really just talking about tenant farmers, rather than freeholding peasants. Next, we can posit a moderate household farm of roughly six iugera (3.8 acres); reasonably close to the median holding in Saint-Thibery and roughly what we think of as the lower-bound for ancient citizen-soldier-peasants. Finally, we can posit a large household farm of nine iugera (5.6 acres), reflective of what seems to be the upper-end of typical for those same citizen-soldier-peasants; at Saint-Thibery in 1460 there were a couple dozen families seemingly in this range.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the sake of a relatively easier calculation, we can assume the same balance of wheat, barley and beans as last time, which lets us just specify an average yield after seed per iugerum of 81.2-189.5 kg of wheat equivalent (achieved by averaging the per-acre wheat equivalent production across all three crops, with seed removed),8 with each iugerum demanding between 11 and 15 working days (averaging the labor requirements across all three crops). Finally, we need to remember the fallow: in this case we’re assuming about a third of each farm is not in production in any given year, meaning it is both not consuming any labor nor producing any crops. That lets us then quickly chart out our peasant families based on the land they might actually have (keeping in mind the household size and household land holdings aren’t going to match; the larger household in people won’t always be the one with more land). First, a reminder of the basic labor availability and grain requirements of our households.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Smalls&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Middles&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Biggs&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Labor Available&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;435 work-days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;507.5 work-days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;797.5 work-days&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bare Subsistence Requirement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~1,189.5kg wheat-equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~1,569kg wheat-equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~2,686kg wheat-equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Respectability Requirement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~2,379kg wheat-equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~3,138kg wheat-equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~5,376kg wheat-equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then for the smallest, 3 iugera farm, the numbers work like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Small Farm (3 iugera)&lt;p&gt;2 iugera cropped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 fallow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Smalls&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Middles&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Biggs&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Labor requirement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22-30 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22-30 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22-30 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Labor surplus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;405-413 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;477.5-485.5 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;767.5-775.5 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Production after Seed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;162.4-378.8kg wheat equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;162.4-378.8kg wheat equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;162.4-378.8kg wheat equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Percentage of Subsistence:&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14-32%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10-24%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6-14%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then for the medium-sized farm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Medium Farm (6 iugera)&lt;p&gt;4 iugera cropped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 fallow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Smalls&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Middles&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The Biggs&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Labor requirement&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;44-60 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;44-60 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;44-60 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Labor surplus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;375-391 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;447.5-463.5 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;737.5-753.5 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Production after Seed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;324.8-757.6kg wheat equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;324.8-757.6kg wheat equivalent&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;324.8-757.6kg wheat equivalent&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the larger (but not rich peasant) farm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Large Farm (9 iugera)&lt;p&gt;6 iugera cropped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 fallow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Labor surplus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;345-369 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;417.5-441.5 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;707.5-731.5 work days&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Production after Seed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;487.6-1,136.5kg wheat equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;487.6-1,136.5k wheat equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;487.6-1,136.5k wheat equivalent&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Percentage of Subsistence:&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;41-96%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;31-72%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18-42%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we immediately see the problem: only the Smalls manage to get close to subsistence on very favorable (8:1) fertility assumptions on the small farm they own. Now it is possible for the peasants to push a little bit on these numbers. The most obvious way would be focusing as much as possible on wheat cultivation, which has higher labor demands but also the highest yield-per-acre (or iugerum), producing around 50% more calories than beans and 35% more calories than barley per-acre (see last week’s post for specifics). But there’s a limit to going ‘all in’ on wheat to meet food shortfalls: the land might not be suitable for it and wheat exhausts the soil, so our farmers would need some sort of rotation. That said, peasant diets were overwhelmingly grains (wheat and barley) for this reason: they provide the most calories for a favorable balance of land and labor. Our farmers might also try to supplement production with high-labor, high-density horticulture; a kitchen garden can take a lot of work but produce a lot of nutrition in a small space. But hitting household nutrition demands entirely with a kitchen garden isn’t going to work both because of the labor demands but also because the products of a kitchen garden tend not to keep well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead the core problem is that our peasant households are much too large as units of labor for the farmland they own. When we say that, what we mean is that given these households are both units of consumption (they have to provide for their members) and units of production (they are essentially agricultural small businesses), an efficient allocation of them would basically have each household on something like 30 acres of farmland, farming all of it (and thus using most of their labor) and selling the excess. But the lack of economically sustainable social niches – that is, jobs that provide a reliable steady income to enable someone to obtain subsistence – means that these families are very reluctant to leave members without any land at all, so the holdings ‘fractionalize’ down to these tiny units, essentially the smallest units that could conceivably support one family (and sometimes not even that).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve already seen folks in the comments realizing almost immediately why these conditions might make conquest or resettlement into areas of land easily brought under cultivation so attraction: if you could give each household 30-40 acres instead of 3-6, you could realize substantial improvements in quality of life (and the social standing of the farmers in question). And of course that kind of ‘land scarcity’ problem seems to have motivated both ancient and early modern settler-colonialism: if you put farmers next to flat, open ground owned by another community, it won’t be too long before they try to make it farmland (violently expelling the previous owners in the process). This is also, I might add, part of the continual friction in areas where nomads and farmers meet: to a farmer, those grazing fields look like more land and more land is really valuable (though the response to getting new land is often not to create a bunch of freeholding large-farm homesteaders, but rather to replicate the patterns of tenancy and non-free agricultural labor these societies already have to the point of – as in the Americas – forcibly trafficking enormous numbers of enslaved laborers at great cost, suffering and horror, to create a non-free dependent class whose exploitation can enable those patterns. Most conquering armies dream of becoming landlords, not peasants).9&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternately as farms these holdings could be a lot more efficient if they had fewer people on them and indeed when we read, for instance, ancient agricultural writers, they recommend estates with significantly fewer laborers per-unit-land-area than what we’d see in the peasant countryside. But that’s because the Big Man is farming for profit with a large estate that lets him tailor his labor force fairly precisely to his labor needs; the peasants are farming to survive and few people are going to let their brother, mother, or children starve and die in a ditch because it makes their farm modestly more productive per unit labor. Instead, they’re going try to do anything in their power to get enough income to have enough food for their entire family to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no real way around it: our peasants need access to more land. And that land is going to come with conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Big Man’s Land&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now before we march into talking about farming someone else’s land, it is worth exploring why our farmers don’t get more land by just bringing more land under cultivation. And the answer here is pretty simple: in most of the world, preparing truly ‘wild’ land for cultivation takes a lot of labor. In dry areas, that labor often comes in the form of irrigation demands: canals have to be dug out from water sources (mainly rivers) to provide enough moisture for the fields as the most productive crops (like wheat) demand a lot of moisture to grow well. In climates suitable for rainfall agriculture, the problem is instead generally forests: if there’s enough rain to grow grain, there’s enough rain to grow trees and those trees have had quite the head start on you. Clearing large sections of forest by hand is a slow, labor-intensive thing and remember, you don’t just need the trees cut down, you need the stumps pulled or burned. Fields also need to be relatively flat – which might demand terracing on hilly terrain – and for the sake of the plow they need to be free of large stones to the depth of the plow (at least a foot or so).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, clearing farmland was both slow and expensive and all of this assumes the land can be made suitable and that no one has title to it. Of course if the forest is the hunting preserve of the local elite, they’re going to object quite loudly to your efforts to cut it down. And a lot of land is simply going to be too dry or too hilly or too marshy to be made usable for farming ona practical time-scale for our peasants. Such land simply cannot be brought usefully into cultivation; you can’t farm wheat in a swamp.10 So it is quite hard and often impractical to bring new land into cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean new land wasn’t brought into cultivation, it absolutely was. We can sometimes track population pressures archaeologically by watching this process: forests retreat, new villages pop up, swamps are drained and so on as previously marginal or unfarmable land is brought into cultivation. Note, of course, if you bring a bunch of marginal fields into cultivation – say, a drier hillside not worth farming before – your average yield is going to go down because that land simply isn’t as productive (but demands the same amount of labor!). But that process is generally slow, taking place over generations in response to population pressures. It isn’t a solution available on the time-scale that most of our households are operating. In the moment, the supply of land is mostly fixed for our peasants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which means our peasants need access to more land (or another way of generating income). There are a range of places that land could come from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Peasant Households without enough labor to farm their own land. In order to make our households relevant at every part of the process, I haven’t modeled the substantial number of very small households we talked about in the first section, households with just 1 or 2 members. If none of those householders were working-age males (e.g. a household with an elderly widow, or a young widow and minor children, etc.) they might seek to have other villagers help farm their land and split the production. For very small households, that might be enough to provide them subsistence (or at least help). Consequently those small, often ‘dying’ households provide a (fairly small) source of land for other households.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rich peasants likewise might have more land than their household could farm or cared to farm. Consider the position The Smalls would be if they were a rich peasant household with, say, 25 acres of land (in Saint-Thibery, 26 households (of 189) had this much or more land). That’s enough land that, under good harvest conditions it would be easy enough to shoot past the household’s respectability requirements. At which point why work so hard? Why not sharecrop out a large chunk of your land to small farmers and split the production, so you still make your respectability basket in decent years, but don’t have to work so darn hard?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Big Man. Another part of this ecosystem is invariably large landowners, who might have estates of hundreds of acres. Columella , for instance, thinks of farm planning (he is thinking about large estates) in units of 100 iugera (62.3 acres) and 200 iugera (124.6 acres; Col. Rust. 12.7-9). An estate of several hundred acres would hardly be unusual. Likewise in the Middle Ages, the Big Man might be a local noble whose manor estate might likewise control a lot of land. The Big Man might also be a religious establishment: temples (in antiquity) and monasteries and churches (in the Middle Ages) often controlled large amounts of productive farmland worked by serfs or tenants to provide their income. Naturally, the Big Man isn’t doing his own farming; he may have some ‘built in’ labor force (workers in his household, enslaved workers, permanent wage laborers, etc.) but often the Big Man is going to rely substantially on the local peasantry for tenant labor.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, the Big Man is likely to represent the bulk of opportunities here, but by no means all of them. As I noted before, while local conditions vary a lot, you won’t be too far wrong in thinking about landholdings as a basic ‘rule of thirds’ with one third of the land controlled by small peasants, one third by rich peasants and one third by the Big Man (who, again, might be a lord or a big landowner or a church, monastery or temple (in the latter case, the land is owned by the god in most polytheistic faiths) or even the king). But of course only a little bit of the small peasant land is going to be in search of workers, since most peasant households have too many hands for too little land; some of the rich peasant land will be looking for workers (either tenants or hired hands), but rich peasants are still peasants – they do some of their farming on their own. By contrast, the Big Man is marked out by the fact that he doesn’t do his own farming: he needs some kind of labor supply – wage laborers, enslaved/non-free laborers or tenants – for all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that also means that something like half (or more!) of the land around our peasant village might be owned by a household that needs outside labor to farm it. So we have peasant households with surplus labor that need more land to farm and richer households with surplus land that needs labor. The solution here generally was some form of tenancy which in the pre-modern world generally came in the form, effectively of sharecropping: the landowner agreed to let the poorer household farm some of his land in exchange for a percentage of the crop that resulted. That ‘rent-in-kind’ structure is useful for the peasants who after all are not generally keeping money with which to pay rent. At the same time, it limits their liability: if the harvest on tenant land fails, they may suffer a shortfall, but they aren’t in debt some monetary quantity of rent (though they may end up in debt in some other way).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the question is: on what terms?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tenancy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the answer here won’t surprise: bad terms. The terms are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a useful discussion of this in L. Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” JRS 980 (1990), which in turn leans on K. Finkler, “Agrarian Reform and Economic Development” in Agricultural Decision Making, ed. P.F. Barlett (1980) to get a sense of what the terms for tenant farmers might normally look like. Foxhall notes in this and a few other studies of modern but largely non-industrial farming arrangements that almost no households in these studies were entirely uninvolved in sharecropping or tenancy arrangements, but that the terms of tenancy arrangements varied a lot based on the inputs supplied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key inputs were labor, traction (for our pre-industrial peasants, this is “who supplies the plow-team animals”), water and seed. The most common arrangement, representing almost a third of all arrangements, was where the tenant supplied labor only, while traction, water and seed were supplied by the landlord; the tenants share in these arrangements was a measly 18.75%. A number of arrangements had the tenant supplying not only labor but also some mix of traction, water or seed (but not all) and often the tenant’s share of the production hovered between 40 and 60%, with exact 50/50 splits occurring in about a quarter of the sample. In just one case did the tenant supply everything but the land itself; in that case the tenant’s share was 81.25%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that is obvious from just this example is that arrangements varied a lot and are going to depend on need and bargaining power. A ‘landlord’ who has land they want under cultivation but can supply basically nothing else may be relatively easy to negotiate into a fairly generous deal; a peasant who is absolutely destitute save for the labor of their hands is easy to exploit. An even 50/50 landholder, tenant split seems to have been the norm in much of Europe though, reflected in terms for sharecropper (métayer in French, mezzadro in Italian, mitateri in Sicilian, mediero in Spanish) which all mean ‘halver,’ though again the terms (and the share split) varied, typically based on demand but also on what exactly the landlord was providing (seed, plow teams, tools, physical infrastructure (like a farmhouse), etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the sake of simplicity in our model, we can assume something like a 50/50 split, with our tenants supplying half of the seed, so that our net yield is exactly half of what it would have been. We can then take those assumptions back to our model. To establish a baseline, let’s run the numbers assuming first a ‘medium’ sized (6 iugera, 3.8 acres, with 4 iugera cropped and 2 fallowed) farm, with our fertility estimate set modestly to 6:1, a ‘good but not great’ yield. We’re going to ’round up’ to the nearest even iugerum and assume an average of 13 days per iugerum of labor, just to make our calculations a bit simpler. How hard is it for our peasants to meet their needs if they have to sharecrop the added land they need?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we can see, tenancy dramatically changes the picture for our peasants. Under these relatively typical assumptions, of our three families all can make subsistence in a normal year but only the Smalls have the right combination of a lot of labor and a relatively small family to have a shot at getting all of their respectability needs (in practice, they’d probably fall short once you consider necessary farm labor not in the fields – fence repair, tool maintenance, home repair and the like). It also isn’t hard to see how we might alter this picture to change our assumptions. Changing the size of the owned farmland has a significant impact (even though it is already so small) because our peasants realize twice the production per unit-land-area for land they own over land they rent (again, terms might vary). Put another way, under these assumptions, somewhat marginal owned farmland that gives an OK-but-not-great yield of 4:1 is of the same use to our peasants as really good tenant-farmed farmland giving a 7:1 yield (both offer 81.2kg of wheat equivalent per iugerum after rent is paid).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the fact that our peasants end up with enough labor to comfortable exceed their subsistence requirements, but not their comfort requirements is favorable for extraction, which we’ll discuss below. These are households with spare labor who can’t fulfill all of their wants entirely on their own, giving the state or local Big Men both a lot of levers to squeeze more labor out of them and also giving the households the available above-subsistence labor to squeeze. By contrast if these peasants had enough land to meet all of their needs themselves, there would be fewer opportunities to compel them to do additional labor beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even before we get to extraction, tenancy is also changing our peasants’ incentives. Economics has the concept of diminishing marginal returns, the frequent phenomenon where adding one more unit of a given input produces less and less output per additional input-unit. You will find more errors in the first hour of proofreading than the fiftieth hour, for instance. There’s also the concept of diminishing marginal utility: beyond a certain point, getting more of something is less valuable per unit added. Getting one bar of chocolate when you have none? Fantastic. Getting one bar of chocolate when you have ten thousand? Solidly meh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are working on our farmers to press their natural production inclination not to maximum labor or even hitting that respectability basket but just subsistence and a little bit more. On the diminishing marginal returns front, naturally when it comes to both owned land and rented land, our peasants are going to farm the most productive land first. This is why when we talk about expanding population and expanding agriculture, we often talk about marginal land (less productive land) coming under cultivation; because all of the really great land was already being farmed. But poor farmland doesn’t demand less labor time (indeed, it may demand more), it just produces less. So while we’ve been working here with averages, you should imagine that the first few acres of farmland will be more productive and the latter few less productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tenancy puts this into even more sharp contrast because it creates a really significant discontinuity in the value of farming additional land: the rents are so high that sharecropped or tenant land is much less useful (per unit labor) to the peasant than their own land. So you have a slow downward slope of ‘land quality’ and somewhere in that slope there is the point at which the peasants have farmed all of their own land and so suddenly the effective yield-per-labor-after-rent drops by half (or more!). So the first few hundred kilograms of wheat equivalent are probably fairly easy to get: you have a few good fields you own and your net out of them might be 130-190kg of wheat equivalent per iugerum. Put in a couple dozen days on those two good iugera and The Smalls have just over a quarter of their subsistence needs. But then they have their more marginal fields, which might only yield 80-100kg. Still not terrible but the next couple of dozen days of labor don’t get them as far: not to half but just 44% or so. But now you are out of your own land, so you go to your rich neighbor or the Big Man to get access to some more and suddenly even on their best fields your yield-per-iugerum is 80-95kg so another couple of dozen working days gets you just from 44% to just 57% of what you need. So you need to line up a lot more land, but now you might be starting to look at the worse fields the Big Man has. He still wants them farmed, after all, his choice is between doing nothing and earning money or doing nothing and not earning money; he’d rather earn money. But suddenly you’re looking at maybe as little as 50-60kg of wheat equivalent per iugerum and the labor demands have not gone down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the comfort you get from each kilogram of wheat equivalent is also going down. The first 80% or so of your subsistence needs is necessary simply to not starve to death; a bit more makes the household sustainable in the long term. But then – and remember, these choices are coming as you are facing diminishing marginal returns on each day of labor you put in – is it really worth your time to cultivate a couple more fields in order to just get a bit more meat in your diet and have slightly nicer household goods? Wouldn’t you rather rest?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so what you see is most peasant households aiming not for the full respectability basket, but that “subsistence – and a little bit more” because as each day of labor produces less product and each product produces less joy, at some point you’d rather not work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as we’ve seen in theory, our households might hit that crossover point – subsistence and a little bit more – fairly quickly in their labor supply. We haven’t yet, but should now, account for labor spent on things like maintaining tools, fixing fences and other capital investments. If we allocate, say, 45 days, for that and assume that our farmers also want to have some cushion on subsistence (say, another 10%), we might expect The Smalls to be more or less satisfied (on that medium landholding, average 6:1 yields) with something like 245 working days (56% of total), the Middles with 331 working days (65%) and the Biggs with 560 (70%). Working like that, they won’t be rich and won’t ever become rich (but they were never going to become rich regardless), but they’ll mostly survive – some years will be hard – and they’ll have a little bit more time to rest. Some families, a bit more industrious, might push towards achieving most or all of the respectability basket, at least in good years; others might be willing to stick closer to subsistence (or unable to do otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course in areas where the farmland is meaningfully more marginal – average yields around 4:1 rather than 6:1 – our peasants are going to need to work quite a lot more, about 60% more. That pushes the Smalls to about 84% of their available labor, the Middles to 99% and the Biggs actually slightly into deficit, demanding roughly 110% of their available labor. We should keep in mind that each peasant household is going to exist somewhere along the spectrum: some with larger amounts of property or access to better land, some with less. We’ll come back to this in a moment, but this is part of why the poorest of the peasantry were often exempt from things like military service: positioned on marginal land in poor communities, they had little excess labor available. Most peasant households would have been somewhere in between these two, so a labor utilization rate ranging from 50 to 100%, with a lot of households in that 60-80% labor utilization range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now you might think, “doesn’t this take us back to peasants actually not working all that much compared to modern workers?” and first I would want to point out that these peasants are also experiencing a quality of living way below workers in modern industrial countries but also no because we haven’t talked about extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of course the problem here, from the perspective of everyone who isn’t our peasants is that if the peasantry only does the amount of agricultural labor necessary to subsist themselves and just a little more, the society doesn’t have economic room for much else in the way of productive (or unproductive) economic activity. Remember: our peasants are the only significant population actually doing farming. Sure the Big Men and the gentry and temples and monasteries may own land, but they are mostly renting that land out to peasants (or hiring peasants to work it, or enslaving peasants and forcing them to work it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And those landholding elites, in turn, want to do things. They want to build temples, wage wars, throw fancy parties, employ literate scribes to write works of literature and of course they also want to live in leisure (not farming) while doing this. And the activities they want to do – the temples, wars, fancy parties, scribes and so on – that requires a lot of food and other agricultural goods to sustain the people doing those things. It also requires a bunch of surplus labor – some of that surplus labor are specialists, but a lot of it is effectively ‘unspecialized’ labor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do those things, those elites need to draw both agricultural surplus and surplus labor out of the countryside. And we should note that of course, obviously, this is an exploitative relationship, but it is also worth noting that for pre-modern agrarian economies, the societies where elites can centralize and control the largest pile of labor and surplus tend to use it to conquer the societies that don’t so ‘demilitarized peasant utopia’ is not a society that is going to last very long (but ‘highly militarized landowner republic’ might).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is thus necessary to note that when we see the emergence of complex agrarian societies – cities, writing, architectural wonders, artistic achievements and so on – these achievements are mostly elite projects, ‘funded’ (in food and labor, if not in money) out of extraction from the peasantry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly how this extraction worked varied a lot society to society and even within regions and ethnic and social classes within society. As noted above, in areas where agriculture was not very productive, extraction was limited. By contrast, highly productive regions didn’t so much producer richer peasants as they tended to produce far higher rates of extraction. In some society, where the freeholding farming peasantry (or part of that peasantry) formed an important political constituency (like some Greek poleis or the Roman Republic), the small farmers might manage to preserve relatively more of their surplus for themselves, but often in exchange for significant demands in terms of military and civic participation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To take perhaps the simplest direct example of removing labor from the countryside, from 218 to 168, the Romans averaged around 10-12 legions deployed in a given year, 45,000-54,000 citizen soldiers.11 Against an adult-male citizen population of perhaps ~250,000 implies that the Roman army was consuming something like a fifth of all of the available citizen manpower in the countryside, though enslaved laborers and males under 17 wouldn’t be captured by this figure. Accounting for those groups we might imagine the Roman dilectus is siphoning off something like 10-15% of the labor capacity of the countryside on average (sometimes spiking far higher, closing in on half of it). On top of that, the demand of these soldiers that they supply their own arms and armor would have pushed farmers to farm a little bit more than subsistence-and-a-little-more to afford the cost of the arms (traded for or purchased with that surplus; at least initially these transactions are not happening in coined money).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see similar systems in the Carolingian levy system or the Anglo-Saxon fyrd, where households might be brigaded together – in the Carolingian system, households were grouped into mansi – based on agricultural production (you can see how that works above as a proxy for ‘available surplus labor!’) with a certain number – three or four mansi in the Carolingian system – required to furnish one armed man for either a regional levy or the main field army. The goal of such systems is to take the surplus labor above and make it available for military service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternately, the elites might not want their peasants as soldiers but as workers. Thus the very frequent appearance of corvée labor: a requirement of a certain amount of intermittent, unpaid forced labor. This might be labor on the local lord’s estate (a sort of unpaid tenancy arrangement) or labor on public works (walls, castles, roads) or a rotating labor force working in state-owned (or elite-owned) productive enterprises (mines, for instance). As with military service, this sort of labor demand could be shaped to what the local populace would bear and enforced by a military aristocracy against a largely disarmed peasantry. Once again looking at the statistics above, even a few weeks a year per man (rather than per household) would drain most of the surplus labor out of our households. Adding, for instance, a month of corvée labor of per work-capable male (an age often pegged around seven for these societies) under our favorable (6:1) assumptions above bring our work totals to 305 days (70% of total) for the Smalls, 373 (77%) for the Middles and 650 (81.5%) for the Biggs. Corvée labor demands could be less than this, but also often quite a bit more (expectations varied a lot by local laws and customs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternately, elites might just crank up the taxes. In the Hellenistic states (the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms especially), the army wasn’t a peasant levy, but rather a core of Greco-Macedonian rentier elites (your ‘rich peasants’ or ‘gentlemen farmers’), regional levies and mercenaries. To pay for that (and fund the lavish courts and public works that royal legitimacy required), the indigenous Levantine, Egyptian, Syrian, Mesopotamian (etc. etc.) underclasses were both made to be the tenants on the estates of those rentier elites (land seized from those same peasants in the initial Macedonian conquest or shortly thereafter) but also to pay very high taxes on their own land.12 So while tax rates on military-settler (that is, Greco-Macedonian rentier elites) land might have been around 10% – 1/12th (8.3%) seems to have been at least somewhat common – taxes on the land of the indigenous laoi could run as high as 50%, even before one got to taxes on markets, customs duties, sales taxes, a head tax and state monopolies on certain natural resources including timber and importantly salt.13 So the poor laoi might be paying extortionate taxes on their own lands, lighter taxes on settler (or temple) lands, but then also paying extortionate rents of those tenant-farmed lands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another micro-scale option was debt. We’ve been assuming our farmers are operating at steady-state subsistence, but as we keep noting, yields in any given year were highly variable. What peasants were forced to do in bad years, almost invariably as go into debt to the Big Man. But as noted, they’re simply not generating a lot in the way of surplus to ever pay off that debt. That in turn makes the debt itself a tool of control, what we often call debt peonage. Since the Big Man sets the terms of the debt (at a time when the peasant is absolutely desperate) it was trivially easy to construct a debt structure that the peasant could never pay off, giving the Big Man leverage to demand services – labor, tenancy on poor terms, broad social deference, etc. – in perpetuity. And of course, if the Big Man ever wants to expand his land holdings, all he would need to do would be to call in the un-payable debt and – depending on the laws around debt in the society – either seize the peasant’s land in payment or reduce the peasant into debt-slavery.14&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, elites had a lot of mechanisms to sop up the excess labor in the countryside and they generally used them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consequently, while peasants, unencumbered by taxes, rents, elites, debt, conscription and so on might have been able to survive working only a relatively small fraction of their time (probably around 100 days per year per-working-age male (again, age 7 or so and up) would suffice), they did not live in that world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, they lived in a world where their own landholdings were extremely small – too small to fully support their households, although their small holdings might still provide a foundation of income for survival. Instead, they had to work on land owned or at least controlled by Big Men: local rentier-elites, the king, temples, monasteries, and so on. Those big institutions which could wield both legal and military force in turn extracted high rents and often demanded additional labor from our peasants, which soaked up much of their available labor, leading to that range of 250-300 working days a year, with 10-12 hour days each, for something on the order of 2,500-3,600 working hours for a farm-laboring peasant annually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is quite a lot more than the c. 250 typical work days (261 weekdays minus holidays/vacation) in the United States – just by way of example of a modern industrial economy – at typically eight hours a day or roughly 2,000 working hours a year. Of course it is also the case that those roughly 2,000 modern hours buy a much better standard of living than what our medieval peasants had access to – consider that a single unimpressive car represents more value just in worked metal (steel) than even many ancient or medieval elites could muster. No, you do not work more than a medieval or ancient peasant: you work somewhat less, in order to obtain far more material comfort. Isn’t industrialization grand?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, our picture of labor in peasant households is not complete! Indeed, we have only seen to half of our subsistence basket – you will recall we broke out textiles separately – because we haven’t yet even really introduced the workload of probably the most fully employed people in these households: the women. And what’s where we’ll go in the next post in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That is, landholders with enough land to subsist off of the rents without needing to do much or any actual agricultural labor themselves.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For scale with the cavalrymen we are talking about just a few thousand households lording over a country of perhaps five million; these fellows are honestly closer to something like a medieval knightly elite than the peasantry.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On these allotments, see P. Johstono, The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt, 323-204 BC (2020), 158-160 and C. Fischer-Bovet, Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt (2014), 212-217. On the rentier-self-sufficiency of these parcels, at a 5:1 yield, 30 aroura should yield something like 3,500kg wheat equivalent (almost 12 million calories), more than enough to support the settler’s household at a 50% rent (see below) using labor from the much smaller adjacent farms of indigenous Egyptians. Indeed, to me it seems very likely the land allotments were calculated precisely on this basis, with infantrymen receiving the smallest allotment that could reliably support a household in leisure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Le Roy Ladurie, Les Paysans de Languedoc (1966)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A reminder that the setérée is an exact unit, about 1/5th to 1/4th of a hectare, so about 0.49-0.62 acres.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rosenstein (2004), 75, n.68; Erdkamp, (2005), 47-8; Cho-yun Hsu, Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy (1980); Johstono, The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt (2020), 101; Fischer-Bovet, Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt (2014), 121&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s hard to tell precisely from what I have because Le Roy Ladurie groups households in brackets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The average yield-per-iugerum at each fertility level in wheat equivalent are: 4:1, 81.2kg; 5:1, 108.2kg; 6:1, 135.3kg; 7:1, 162.4kg; 8:1, 189.5kg.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I would argue that the Roman approach to Italy from 509 to 218 BC appears to be an exception to this rule: the Romans do tend to use conquered land to set up large numbers of small landholding farms. Not rich peasants, but the Roman military class – the assidui farmer-citizen-soldiers – were also clearly not utterly impoverished either. It’s striking that the Romans could have set up a system of rents and tribute extraction in Italy but didn’t, instead effectively terraforming the Italian countryside into a machine for the production of heavy infantry. That heavy infantry in turn bought the Romans stunning military superiority, which they then used in the second and first centuries BC to create an enormous system of tribute and extraction (rather than extending the approach they had used in Italy).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Of course you can drain a swamp, but such drainage efforts are the kinds of things large, well-administered states do, not the sort of thing your local peasants can summon the labor for.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On Roman deployments, see Taylor, Soldiers and Silver (2020).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The way this was structurally, legally, was that the king, directly or indirectly owned all the land (‘spear-won’) and so many taxes were instead technically ‘rents’ paid to the king.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On the Seleucid taxation system, see Aperghis, The Seleucid Royal Economy (2004). For an overview of the relatively similar Ptolemaic system, see von Reden, Money in Ptolemaic Egypt (2007), Préaux, . L’économie royale des Lagides (1979).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The abolition of this specific form of slavery (but not others) is a key political moment in the development of both Rome and Athens (and we may assume, many other Greek poleis) that signals the political importance of the smallholding farmer-citizens and their ability to compel major reforms. But the Big Man can still seize your farm!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;California lawmakers pass SB 79, housing bill that brings dense housing to transit hubs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Share via&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;California lawmakers passed SB 79, a bill that would override local zoning laws to allow dense housing developments up to nine stories near transit hubs statewide.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The controversial bill affects single-family neighborhoods within half-miles of transit stops, sparking protests and opposition from L.A. City Council.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Labor union support helped secure passage after amendments requiring union hiring on certain projects, despite local community resistance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The bill will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom in October.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;California lawmakers just paved the way for a whole lot more housing in the Golden State.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the waning hours of the 2025 legislative session, the state Senate voted 21 to 8 to approve Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill that overrides local zoning laws to expand high-density housing near transit hubs. The controversial bill received a final concurrence vote from the Senate on Friday, a day after passing in the California Assembly with a vote of 41 to 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bill had already squeaked through the state Senate by a narrow margin earlier this year, but since it was amended in the following months, it required a second approval. It will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk in October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the more ambitious state-imposed efforts to increase housing density in recent years, the bill was introduced in March by Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who stresses that the state needs to take immediate action to address California’s housing shortage. It opens the door for taller, denser housing near transit corridors such as bus stops and train stations: up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain transit stops, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile and six stories for buildings within a half-mile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops would be subject to the new zoning rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Height limits are based on tiers. Tier 1 zoning, which includes heavy rail lines such as the L.A. Metro B and D lines, allows for six- to nine-story buildings, depending on proximity to the transit hub. Tier 2 zoning — which includes light rail lines such as the A, C, E and K lines, as well as bus routes with dedicated lanes — allows for five- to eight-story buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An amateur map released by a cartographer and fact-checked by YIMBY Action, a housing nonprofit that helped push the bill through, gives an idea of the areas around L.A. that would be eligible for development under SB 79. Tier 1 zones include hubs along Wilshire Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, as well as a handful of spots in downtown L.A. and the San Fernando Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 2 zones are more spread out, dotting Exposition Boulevard along the E line, stretching toward Inglewood along the K line, and running from Long Beach into the San Gabriel Valley along the A line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assembly members debated the bill for around 40 minutes on Thursday evening and cheered after it was passed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Over the last five years, housing affordability and homelessness have consistently been among the top priorities in California. The smartest place to build new housing is within existing communities, near the state’s major transit investments that connect people to jobs, schools and essential services,” said Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva (D-Orange County) in support of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Assembly members, including Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), Juan Carrillo (D-Palmdale) and Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) voiced their support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proponents say drastic measures are necessary given the state’s affordability crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“SB 79 is what we’ve been working towards for a decade — new housing next to our most frequently used train stations. This bill has the potential to unlock hundreds of thousands of new multifamily homes,” said YIMBY Action California director Leora Tanjuatco Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics claim the blanket mandate is an overreach, stripping local authorities of their ability to promote responsible growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assemblymember Rick Zbur (D-West Hollywood) argued against the bill, claiming it will affect lower-priced neighborhoods more than wealthy ones since land prices are cheaper for housing developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vote came a few weeks after the Los Angeles City Council came out against the bill, voting 8 to 5 on a resolution opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Councilmember Traci Park, who co-authored the resolution with Councilmember John Lee, called SB 79 a “one-size-fits-all mandate from Sacramento.” Lee called it “chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resolution called for L.A. to be exempt from the upzoning since it already has a state-approved housing plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bill has spurred multiple protests in Southern California communities, including Pacific Palisades and San Diego. Residents fear the zoning changes would alter single-family communities and force residents into competition with developers, who would be incentivized under the new rules to purchase properties near transit corridors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, support for SB 79 surged in recent days after the State Building and Construction Trades Council, a powerful labor group that represents union construction workers, agreed to reverse its opposition in exchange for amendments that add union hiring to certain projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement after the deal was struck, the trades council President Chris Hannan said the amendments would provide good jobs and training to California’s skilled construction workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiener, who has unsuccessfully tried to pass similar legislation twice before, said the deal boosted the bill’s chances.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Just got word that the court dismissed several of WP Engine and Silver Lake’s most serious claims — antitrust, monopolization, and extortion have been knocked out! These were by far the most significant and far-reaching allegations in the case and with today’s decision the case is narrowed significantly. This is a win not just for us but for all open source maintainers and contributors. Huge thanks to the folks at Gibson and Automattic who have been working on this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With respect to any remaining claims, we’re confident the facts will demonstrate that our actions were lawful and in the best interests of the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ruling is a significant milestone, but our focus remains the same: building a free, open, and thriving WordPress ecosystem and supporting the millions of people who rely on it every day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have great news to share: After three months of fighting, our Chatbox app is finally back on the U.S. App Store! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;lb/&gt; In April 2025, another company with an app of the same name filed a dispute with Apple, claiming they held a trademark for the word “Chatbox.”&lt;lb/&gt; I believe this claim was baseless, because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Chatbox" is a widely used, generic word across the internet, and their trademark application had already been initially rejected by the USPTO.&lt;lb/&gt; We were the first to use “Chatbox” as the name for AI software, starting in March 2023 right here on GitHub.&lt;lb/&gt; However, Apple’s legal team accepted their claim and removed our app from the store on June 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking legal action&lt;lb/&gt; We decided to take the matter to federal court. The court ruled in our favor and issued an order to Apple on August 29 to restore our app within 7 days. After about two weeks, Apple finally notified us that the app was back online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this matters&lt;lb/&gt; This is a victory against trademark bullying and an important win for our community. We stood our ground, defended our rights, and made sure our app—and its name—stayed ours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your ongoing support throughout this challenging journey!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— Chatbox Dev Team&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This beautiful tool allows you to explore the contents of a registry interactively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can even drill down into layers to explore an image's filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter a public image, e.g. "ubuntu:latest":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter a public repository, e.g. "ubuntu":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This service lives on Cloud Run and uses google/go-containerregistry for registry interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really! Ingress is cheap, Cloud Run is cheap, and GCS is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid paying for egress, I limit the amount of data that I'll serve directly and instead give you a command you can run on your own machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most expensive part of this is actually the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really! The first time a layer is accessed, I download and index it. Browsing the filesystem just uses that index, and opening a file uses Range requests to load small chunks of the layer as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I only have to download the whole layer once, this actually reduces traffic to the registry in a lot of cases, e.g. if you share a link with someone rather than having them pull the whole image on their machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, Docker has graciously sponsored this service by providing me an account with unlimited public Docker Hub access. Thanks, Docker!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's not a question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great question! See here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tl;dr, you can seek to an arbitrary position in a gzip stream if you know the 32KiB of uncompressed data that comes just before it, so by storing ~1% of the uncompressed layer size, I can jump ahead to predetermined locations and start reading from there rather than reading the entire layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks @aidansteele!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! See here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A TypeScript/JavaScript port of Markus Kuhn’s wcwidth and wcswidth implementations, optimized to O(1).&lt;lb/&gt; These functions are defined in IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;import wcwidth from 'wcwidth-o1';

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;: Max characters to process (defaults to full length).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fixed-width terminals, most Latin characters take up one column, while East Asian (CJK) ideographs usually take up two. The challenge is deciding how many “cells” each Unicode character should occupy so that text aligns correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Unicode standard defines width classes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wide (W) and Fullwidth (F) - always 2 columns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Halfwidth (H) and Narrow (Na) - always 1 column&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ambiguous (A) - 1 column normally, but 2 in CJK compatibility mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Neutral (N) - treated as 1 column here for simplicity&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other rules include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;U+0000&lt;/code&gt;(null) - width 0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Control characters - &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combining marks - width 0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Soft hyphen (&lt;code&gt;U+00AD&lt;/code&gt;) - width 1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero width space (&lt;code&gt;U+200B&lt;/code&gt;) - width 0&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This logic originates from Markus Kuhn’s reference implementation and is widely used in terminal emulators to ensure consistent alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Unicode TR#11 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Raspberry Pi Synthesizers – How the Pi is transforming synths&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The readymade pocket computer is replacing custom DSP.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi microcomputer is finding its way into more and more synthesizers. Do your synths have a slice of it inside? Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital synthesizers are essentially computers in specialized housings. Rather than a keyboard with letters and numbers, their keyboards trigger notes. Custom-designed DSP (digital signal processing) systems can be expensive so some manufacturers are turning to ready-made computing systems to run their synths. One that’s been gaining in popularity in recent years is Raspberry Pi. The low-cost mini computer is now in instruments by Korg, Erica Synths and many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this cheating? Do any of your synths have Pi inside? Let’s find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DSP In Synthesizers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital synthesizers have existed in some form since the 1970s, with the New England Digital Synclavier being the first commercial release in 1977. As synthesizers became more powerful, adding sampling and physical modelling to the already existing FM synthesis, the DSP required to run them became more complex. Additions like sequencers and effects only compounded the expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To run their DSP, manufacturers created custom DSP systems running on off-the-shelf chips from companies like Motorola and Texas Instruments. One example was Korg’s Pentium-based OASYS workstation from 2005. While incredibly powerful, it was also incredibly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to keep the power while also lowering the cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Raspberry Pi: What Is It?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution for Korg – as well as other manufacturers, as we’ll see – was the Raspberry Pi. Essentially a complete computer processor in a small and – critically – inexpensive package, this programmable hardware get used for all sorts of applications. From robotics to home computing to (you guessed it) digital synthesizers, ready-made Raspberry Pis offer an elegant and affordable solution for custom computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Korg Serves Up Some Pi&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest synthesizer manufacturer to make use of the Raspberry Pi is Korg. The Japanese synth company’s Wavestate, Modwave and Opsix digital synths all make use of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module. (They’re in the module versions too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an article on the Raspberry Pi home page, Korg’s Andy Leary sites price and manufacturing scale as the main reason Korg decided on these components. He also liked that it was ready to go as is, providing CPU, RAM and storage in a single package. “That part of the work is already done,” he said in the article. “It’s like any other component; we don’t have to lay out the board, build it and test it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software for each instrument is, of course, custom. The Raspberry Pi, however, generates the sound. “Not everyone understands that Raspberry Pi is actually making the sound,” said Korg’s Dan Philips in the same piece. “We use the CM3 because it’s very powerful, which makes it possible to create deep, compelling instruments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Erica Synths Also Likes Pi&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not expect to find a Raspberry Pi inside an analogue synthesizer but if that synth happens to have digital functionality… Take the Bullfrog, for example. Erica Synths and Richie Hawtin’s educational desktop analogue has a RP2040 to handle MIDI implementation as well as functionality for the Sampler/Looper voice card. This adds additional functionality to the largely analogue synthesizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zynthian: Pi For Everyone&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of using Raspberry Pi is the ability to make it open source. The DIY kit Zynthian is an open synth platform with a Raspberry Pi 4 at its centre. The desktop box can function as a keyboard expander, effects unit, MIDI processor, groovebox or even micro-DAW. “Zynthian is a community-driven project and it’s 100% open source,” the company says on its site. “Free software on Open hardware. Completely configurable and fully hackable!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Damn Fine Pi&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty more synths making use of the Raspberry Pi. One that you may not realize is Organelle M by Critter and Guitari. By putting a Pi inside, they’re able to run Pure Data, meaning that you can program your own synths to use inside too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another fun instrument with a Raspberry Pi 3 for a soul is Tasty Chips’ GR-1 Granular synthesizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For something a little more esoteric, try the Yoshimi Pi. “Yoshimi Pi is the hardware incarnation of the software synth Yoshimi, running on a Raspberry Pi 4 in a rugged metal case with a built-in PSU and line level audio output,” according to the product page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you don’t have to buy a commercial Raspberry Pi-based synthesizer. There are plenty of DIY options to run them “bare metal,” that is, without a separate operating system. Just hook up a MIDI controller to the board and you’re off and running. Try MiniSynth Pi or code your own!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Raspberry Pi: Is It Cheating?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way that some claim that virtual analogue is just a “VST in a box,” others complain that synths with Raspberry Pi at the core are somehow cheating. You may as well just make your own, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because something is based on a Raspberry Pi it doesn’t mean it’s trivial to make one,” said chalk_walk in a Reddit thread on the Organelle. “If they provide the software then you may be able to put together something equivalent, but if not: you are out of luck if you want an Organelle. Similarly, part of the complexity is in making an enclosure with appropriate controls and displays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, all digital synthesizers have some kind of computer inside. Whether that’s a custom DSP with off-the-shelf chips or a Raspberry Pi, you still have to code the software, design the enclosure and PCBs and everything else that goes along with it. By going with a little computer like this, you can shave some money off the asking price and save on development time too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More Information&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Raspberry Pi’s home page&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Korg’s home page&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Erica Synths’ home page&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Zynthian’s home page&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;All about synthesizers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;14 responses to “Raspberry Pi Synthesizers – How the Pi is transforming synths”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong, but I don’t think any of these synths use the type of RasbPi shown in this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, they’re using one of the microcontroller versions, which fundamentally isn’t much different than digital synths running on ESP32 or Teensy, it just has more power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, they’re still way closer to bare metal than a device running linux on what is essentially a full computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are mostly wrong. The Korg synths that lead off the article use the Compute Module 3, which is equivalent to the Pi 3 pictured at the top of the article—just on a smaller PCB without all the ports soldered on.&lt;lb/&gt; That allows the Korg synths to run Linux (I assume) and basically the same code as the desktop VST versions of the synths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of the synths in this article don’t use the exact form factor pictured, I think the Tasty Chips GR-1 does. If you look at the ports on the back, it has a cluster of Ethernet and 4x USB in the same arrangement as an off-the-shelf Pi 3/3+, so I think they built around that instead of the OEM-focused Compute Module form factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article does mention that the Bullfrog uses a Pi RP2040, which is similar to an ESP32 or Teensy, so that one sticks out compared with the others. You’re right that the RP2040 doesn’t have the same power as the Pis that the others use – it doesn’t run a desktop OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other synths in this article are essentially full computers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d be shocked if they were running even the lightest Linux distro; if they’re on CM3 I’d wager there’s a very lightweight custom OS there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some could potentially use a really lightweight Linux. But as far as I know, most of them use some kind of firmware that is loaded from SD and ultimately represents the synthesizer software. The Pi Foundation provides software libraries with which you can easily access and use the hardware. These libraries can be used to program synthesizers that avoid the burden and loading times of an OS like Linux. Ultimately, the Raspberry Pi is operated like a (very large) microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great article. I’ve had a Zynthian for a couple of years, and it does a lot more, for instance Pure Data, Set B Free, Aeolus, and more. The guts are a full RPi, a sound card hat, and custom built MIDI and audio IOs. Haven’t got version 5 yet, but it’s even more advanced…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting article and a good intro to the Pi being used in synths!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew the Korg trio ran on the CM3 and obviously the Monome Norns is built around a Pi, but I was unaware of the GR-1 or Organelle M using these single-board computers at their core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do think the Erica Synths Bullfrog doesn’t really fit in this article—the Pi RP2040 has almost nothing in common with a full Pi like the others use. It’s made by the Pi foundation, yes, but it’s more a microcontroller like an Arduino than it is a computer. And obviously, the Bullfrog uses it very differently than the others, which synthesize their sounds on a full Pi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised that you didn’t mention the MiniDexed, a Pi based emulation of the Yamaha TX816.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And contrary to what Nathan said, some of them (like Zynthian) *do* use the mainline Pi hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Zynthian runs on a Raspberry Pi 400, has an HDMI USB 7″ LCD panel and a Behringer 404HD sound card. Yes, it’s not an official project kit, but the Zynthian project has a hardware part (for which you need a raspberry pi 3 or 4, and there will definitely be a version for rpi 5) and then the software, which can be used for the mentioned raspberry and your configuration of the display, sound card, encoders and buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not informed on this topic, but a few years ago I suggested a computer based keyboard/controller into which you could load multiple VSTs. That would be possible with Pi boards. Someone would have to code an O/S launcher/menu, from which you could choose Sylenth etc to load into a VST host from a menu, with the keyboard’s knobs and buttons assigned to those on the softsynth. Making a hardware synth out of a soft synth, with maybe hundreds of synths to choose from. All the Arturia stuff etc, Mellotron, EPs, Organs etc, that’d sell very well, wouldn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something along the lines of this?&lt;lb/&gt; mpmidi.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tablets and phones could perfectly do that. They are powerful enough to emulate and wrap vsts and some soundcards are even compatible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we’ll probably will never have this since that would be emulating something that wasn’t sold on an app store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a few embedded audio projects with a raspberry pi and pure data; and it’s a great platform for this kind of stuff (I mostly stayed with the default distro but it still works great).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;monome norns shield is a nifty little music computer that’s based on the rPi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoshimi Pi uses a standard Raspberry Pi 4B, with just a small bespoke PCB purely for controlled switch on and switch off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are currently viewing a placeholder content from Facebook.
