      &lt;p&gt;All systems go at SFO! Waymo has received our pilot permit allowing for commercial operations at San Francisco International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ll partner with SFO to prepare our operations at the airport in phases, beginning with employee testing soon ahead of welcoming Bay Area riders. Pickups and dropoffs will initially start at SFO’s Kiss &amp;amp; Fly area – a short AirTrain ride from the terminals – with the intention to explore other locations at the airport in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a major milestone that strengthens Waymo’s impact on the region and offers residents and visitors an innovative way to travel. With years of experience serving riders at Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) and operations beginning soon at San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC), we’re accelerating our efforts to serve more airports in more cities as we scale.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Across San Francisco, we are expanding safe, reliable, and modern transportation options—supporting our city’s economic comeback, boosting our tourism industry, and connecting residents and visitors to everything our city has to offer,” said Mayor Lurie. “We announced in March that we wanted visitors to be able to ride in a Waymo as soon as they arrived in San Francisco, and today, we are taking another important step to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Bringing the Waymo experience to San Francisco International Airport is about more than just a ride—it’s about providing a safe, reliable, magical way for Bay Area residents and global visitors to connect with the places and people that matter most,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “We’re grateful for the partnership with SFO and the vision of Mayor Lurie in making this a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Denmark close to wiping out leading cancer-causing HPV strains after vaccine roll-out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A nationwide study suggests infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 have been virtually eliminated since vaccination began in 2008 – protecting even unvaccinated women.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 September 2025&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 min read&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;by Linda Geddes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Denmark has effectively eliminated infections with the two biggest cancer-causing strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) since the vaccine was introduced in 2008, data suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research, published in Eurosurveillance, could have implications for how vaccinated populations are screened in the coming years – particularly as people increasingly receive vaccines that protect against multiple high-risk types of HPV virus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deadly cancer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer among women aged 15 to 44 years in Europe, and human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least 14 high-risk types of the virus have been identified, and before Denmark introduced the HPV vaccine in 2008, HPV types 16 and 18 accounted for around three quarters (74%) of cervical cancers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, girls were offered a vaccine that protected against four types of HPV: 16, 18, plus the lower risk types 6 and 11. However, since 2017, Danish girls have been offered a vaccine that protects against nine types of HPV – including those accounting for approximately 90% of cervical cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Have you read?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To better understand the impact that these vaccination programmes have had on HPV prevalence as vaccinated girls reach cervical screening age (23 to 64 years in Denmark), Dr Mette Hartmann Nonboe at Zealand University Hospital in Nykøbing Falster and colleagues analysed up to three consecutive cervical cell samples collected from Danish women between 2017 and 2024, when they were 22 to 30 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In 2017, one of the first birth cohorts of women in Denmark who were HPV-vaccinated as teenage girls in 2008 reached the screening age of 23 years,” Nonboe explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Compared with previous generations, these women are expected to have a considerably lower risk of cervical cancer, and it is pertinent to assess [their] future need for screening.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;High-risk HPV elimination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research found that infection with the high-risk HPV types (HPV16/18) covered by the vaccine has been almost eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Before vaccination, the prevalence of HPV16/18 was between 15 and 17%, which has decreased in vaccinated women to less than one percent by 2021,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in women who had not been vaccinated against HPV was five percent. This strongly suggests that the vaccine has reduced the circulation of these HPV types in general population, to the extent that even unvaccinated women are now less likely to be infected with them – so called “population immunity” – the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this good news, roughly one third of women screened during the study period still had infection with high-risk HPV types not covered by the original vaccines – and new infections with these types were more frequent among vaccinated women, compared to unvaccinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is expected to fall once girls who received the more recent ‘nine-valent’ vaccine reach screening age. At this point, the screening guidelines should potentially be reconsidered, Nonboe and colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, the compact, small form factor PC segment witnessed a significant refreshment with the launch of the Framework desktop PC. If you've missed it and are wondering why this mini-PC is considered so special, it's because it was the first desktop PC to utilise the AMD Ryzen AI Max APU, a processor previously exclusive to laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AMD Ryzen AI Max processor stands out for its exceptional speed and integrated graphics performance, frequently surprising users with its gaming capabilities, even on demanding titles. Users often highlight its powerful integrated GPU, which can leverage a massive memory pool (up to 96GB for AI tasks), allowing it to efficiently handle complex AI and deep learning workloads. The raw performance delivered by this chip makes it a worthwhile choice for intensive tasks and creative workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a collaborator and partner on the Framework Desktop mini-PC project, our first steps involved integrating our NF-A12x25 fan and a fan duct. This way, we could significantly reduce system noise levels while ensuring safe operating temperatures – you can read more about this here. But can the Framework Desktop be made even quieter? We wanted to leave no stone unturned to find out, so we took it a step further by trying to integrate our signature Noctua fan grill design that debuted on the Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It must be noted that customer safety and EMC requirements for the mini PC, a standalone electrical item, differ from those for hardware components (such as the PSU) designed to be inside a PC case. The safety standard suggests that ventilation openings on case side panels need to be less than 5mm in diameter. To comply with safety regulations, we created an updated version of the original fan grille as implemented on the Seasonic Prime TX 1600 Noctua Edition power supply featuring more struts and a smaller opening size, ensuring full adherence to these standards. To complement the new grille design, we have also designed a custom, funnel shaped fan duct that makes maximum use of the outermost openings of the custom side panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In combination, the custom side panel and duct design provided a massive noise reduction compared to the stock configuration, particularly in lower fan speed ranges. We have measured around 7 dB(A) lower noise levels at around 50% fan speed, and up to 5 dB(A) lower at higher fan speeds, when compared at the same APU operating temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the custom side panel with our signature Noctua grill as well as the custom fan duct are not slated for mass production at this point, we are more than happy to share the 3D CAD files for everyone who is looking to make their Framework Desktop run even quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the custom side panel and the customised fan ductare available to download at Printables.com for you to 3D-print at home:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom side panel with Noctua-style fan grill&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom fan duct to make best use of the custom side panel&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the quality of 3D printing technologies has advanced so much that you can end up with a nice, clean side panel, which will additionally optimise the sound profile, or bring your APU temperatures down significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes. The findings of these tests may prove surprising. The additional NF-A8 PWM fan, which was added as an exhaust fan at the front of the case, yielded slightly lower temperatures, but at the expense of extra noise emission, so it’s not a setup that we would recommend from a performance-to-noise efficiency point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While upgrading to an NF-A12x25 G2 does provide some acoustical benefits compared to the stock setup (around 1 to 1.5 dB(A) lower noise levels at the same temperatures), its maximum speed is limited to 1800 RPM, so it cannot match the performance headroom of the 2400 RPM HS-PWM version of the NF-A12x25 that is supplied with the Framework Desktop PC. This high-speed version of the „G1“ fan is a safeguard that ensures the system can maintain full performance in worst-case conditions with high ambient temperatures. In other words, we would only recommend upgrading to the NF-A12x25 G2 if you seek to lower noise levels as much as possible and if you are willing to sacrifice the maximum performance headroom in worst-case scenarios that the G1 HS-PWM fan provides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, after a lot of simulation, experimenting and testing, we can conclude that not all tweaks to the Framework Desktop’s cooling setup make sense. However, if you have access to a 3D printer, swapping the stock side panel and fan duct for the custom designed ones can help to make your unit run significantly quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In Defense of C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Reputation of C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ has often and frequently been criticized for its complexity, steep learning curve, and most of all for its ability to allow the developers using it to not only shoot themselves in the foot, but to blow off their whole leg in the process. But do these criticisms hold up under scrutiny?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, in this blog post, I aim to tackle some of the most common criticisms of C++ and provide a balanced perspective on its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is “Complex”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is indeed a complex language, with a vast array of features and capabilities. For any one thing you wish to achieve in C++, there are about a dozen different ways to do it, each with its own trade-offs and implications. So, as a developer, how are you to know which approach is the best one for your specific use case? Surely you have to have a deep understanding of the language to make these decisions, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really… I mean, don’t get me wrong, it helps, but it’s not a hard requirement. Premature optimization is the root of all evil, and in C++, you can write perfectly fine code without ever needing to worry about the more complex features of the language. You can write simple, readable, and maintainable code in C++ without ever needing to use templates, operator overloading, or any of the other more advanced features of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s this idea that for everything you want to do in any programming language, you need to use the most efficient and correct approach possible. Python has this with their pythonic way of doing things, Java has this, C# has this, and Go has this. Heck, even something as simple as painting HTML onto a browser needs to be reinvented every couple of years and argued about ad nauseam. Here’s the thing, though, in most cases, there is no one right way to do something. The hallowed “best approach” is often just a matter of personal or team preference. The idea that if you just write your code in the “best” and correct way, you’ll never need to worry about maintaining it is just plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t worry so much about using the “best” approach; worry more about writing code that is easy to read and understand. If you do that, you’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is “Outdated”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is very old, in fact, it came out in 1985, to put it into perspective, that’s 4 years before the first version of Windows was released, and 6 years before the first version of Linux came out, or to drive the point even further home, back when the last 8-bit computer was released. So yes, C++ is quite old by any standard. But does that make it outdated?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hell no it’s not like C++ has just been sitting around unchanged from its 1985 release. C++ has been actively developed and improved upon for over 40 years now, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. The most recent version of the C++ standard, C++20, was released in 2020 and introduced a number of new features and improvements to the language. C++23 has introduced significant enhancements, particularly in the standard library and constexpr capabilities. Notably, concepts, ranges, and coroutines have been expanded, bringing modern programming paradigms to C++ and making the language more powerful and expressive th an ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dave, what we mean by outdated is that other languages have surpassed C++ and provide a better developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matter of personal taste, I guess, C++ is still one of the most widely used programming languages with a huge ecosystem of libraries and tools. It’s used in a wide range of applications, from game development to high-performance computing to embedded systems. Many of the most popular and widely used software applications in the world are written in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think C++ is outdated by any stretch of the imagination; you have to bend the definition of outdated quite a bit to make that claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is “Unsafe”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, finally, we get to the big one, and yes, I will draw comparisons to Rust as it’s the “memory safe” language that a lot of people claim will or should replace C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, let’s get the main point out of the way right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rewrites of C++ codebases to Rust always yield more memory-safe results than before.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countless companies have cited how they improved their security or the amount of reported bugs or memory leaks by simply rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now is that because of Rust? I’d argue in some small part, yes. However, I think the biggest factor is that any rewrite of an existing codebase is going to yield better results than the original codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you rewrite a codebase, you have the opportunity to rethink and redesign the architecture, fix bugs, and improve the overall quality of the code. You get to leverage all the lessons learned from the previous implementation, all the issues that were found and fixed, and you already know about. All the headaches that would be too much of a pain to fix in the existing codebase, you can just fix them in the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if you will that you’ve built a shed, it was a bit wobbly, and you didn’t really understand proper wood joinery when you first built it, so it has a few other issues, like structural integrity and a leaky roof. After a few years, you build a new one, and this time you know all the mistakes you made the first time around, so you build it better, stronger, and more weatherproof. In the process, you decide to replace the materials you’ve previously used, say for example, instead of using maple, you opt for oak. Is it correct to say that the new shed is better only because you used oak instead of maple? Or is that a really small part of the overall improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s how I feel when I see these companies claim that rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust has made them more memory safe. It’s not because of Rust, it’s because they took the time to rethink and redesign their codebase and implemented all the lessons learned from the previous implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But that does not deny the fact that C++ is unsafe.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, C++ can be unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. But here’s the thing: all programming languages are unsafe if you don’t know what you’re doing. You can write unsafe code in Rust, you can write unsafe code in Python, you can write unsafe code in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory safety is just one aspect of safety in programming languages; you can still write unsafe code in memory-safe programming languages. Just using Rust will not magically make your application safe; it will just make it a lot harder to have memory leaks or safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “unsafe” is a bit too vague in this context, and I think it’s being used as a catch-all term, which to me reeks of marketing speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can C++ be made safer?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, C++ can be made safer; in fact, it can even be made memory safe. There are a number of libraries and tools available that can help make C++ code safer, such as smart pointers, static analysis tools, and memory sanitizers. Heck, if you wish, you can even add a garbage collector to C++ if you really want to(please don’t).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the easiest and most straightforward way to make C++ safer is to simply learn about smart pointers and use them wherever necessary. Smart pointers are a way to manage memory in C++ without having to manually allocate and deallocate memory. They automatically handle the memory management for you, making it much harder to have memory leaks or dangling pointers. This is the main criticism of C++ in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is Hard to Read&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then don’t write it that way. C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language; you can write procedural code, object-oriented code, functional code, or a mix of all three. You can write simple and readable code in C++ if you want to. You can also write complex and unreadable code in C++ if you want to. It’s all about personal or team preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a rule of thumb I like to follow for C++: make it look as much like C as you possibly can, and avoid using too many advanced features of the language unless you really need to. Use smart pointers, avoid raw pointers, and use the standard library wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do a heck of a lot of programming by just using C++ as you would C and introducing complexity only when you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of C++? Why not just use C then?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is a superset of C you can write C code in C++, and it will work just fine. C++ adds a lot of features and capabilities to C. If you were to start with C, then you are locked with C, and that’s fine for a lot of cases, don’t get me wrong, but C++ gives you the option to use more advanced features of the language when you need them. You can start with C and then gradually introduce C++ features as you need them. You don’t have to use all the features of C++ if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, going back to my shed analogy, if you build a shed out of wood, you can always add a metal roof later if you need to. You don’t have to build the whole shed out of metal if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ has a confusing ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ has a large ecosystem built over the span of 40 years or so, with a lot of different libraries and tools available. This can make it difficult to know which libraries and tools to use for a specific task. But this is not unique to C++; every programming language has this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, the simple rule of thumb is to use the standard library wherever possible; it’s well-maintained and has a lot of useful features. For other tasks like networking or GUI development, there are a number of well-known libraries that are widely used and well-maintained. Do some research and find out which libraries are best suited for your specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid boost like the plague. Boost is a large collection of libraries that are widely used in the C++ community. However, many of the libraries in boost are outdated and no longer maintained. They also tend to be quite complex and difficult to use. If you can avoid using boost, do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you are writing a large and complex application that requires the specific features provided by Boost, you are better off using other libraries that are more modern and easier to use. Do not add the performance overhead and binary size bloat of Boost to your application unless you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is not a good choice for beginners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming is not a good choice for beginners, woodworking is not a good choice for beginners, and car mechanics is not a good choice for beginners. Programming is hard; it takes time and effort to learn, as all things do. There is no general language that is really good for beginners; everything has its trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact is, if you wanna get into something like systems programming or game development then starting with Python or JavaScript won’t really help you much. You will eventually need to learn C or C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your goal is to become a web developer or data scientist, then start with Python or JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you just want a job in the programming industry, I don’t know, learn Java or C#, both great languages that get a lot of undeserved hate, but offer a lot of job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, here’s the thing: if you’re just starting out in programming, yeah, it’s gonna be hard no matter what language you choose. I’d actually argue that starting with C or C++ is far better than starting with something that obscures a lot of the underlying concepts of programming, I’d argue further that by starting with Python or Javascript you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run and trading off the pain of learning something when your understanding of a topic is still fresh and malleable for the pain of learning something later when you have a lot more invested in your current understanding of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But hey, that’s just my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ vs Rust: Friends or Rivals?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust has earned a lot of love in recent years, and for good reason. It takes memory safety seriously, and its borrow checker enforces discipline that C++ often leaves to the programmer. That said, Rust is still building its ecosystem, and the learning curve can feel just as steep — just in different ways. C++ may not prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot, but it gives you decades of battle-tested tooling, compilers, and libraries that power everything from Chrome to Unreal Engine. In practice, many teams use Rust and C++ together rather than treating them as enemies. Rust shines in new projects where safety is the priority, while C++ continues to dominate legacy systems and performance-critical domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is C++ Still Used in 2025?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short answer: absolutely. Despite the constant chatter that it’s outdated, C++ remains one of the most widely used languages in the world. Major browsers like Chrome and Firefox are still written in it. Game engines like Unreal run on it. Automotive systems, financial trading platforms, and even AI frameworks lean heavily on C++ for performance and control. New standards (C++20, C++23) keep modernizing the language, ensuring it stays competitive with younger alternatives. If you peel back the layers of most large-scale systems we rely on daily, you’ll almost always find C++ humming away under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that has stood the test of time. While it does have its complexities and challenges, it remains a relevant and widely used language in today’s tech landscape. With the right approach and mindset, C++ can be a joy to work with and can yield high-performance and efficient applications. So next time you hear someone criticize C++, take a moment to consider the strengths and capabilities of this venerable language before dismissing it outright.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;No feature is truly “the worst” in CSS, right? After all, it’s all based on opinion and personal experience, but if we had to reach a consensus, checking the State of CSS 2025 results would be a good starting point. I did exactly that, jumped into the awards section, and there I found it: the “Most Hated Feature,” a title no CSS should have bear…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shocks me, if I’m being honest. Are really trigonometric functions really that hated? I know “hated” is not the same as saying something is “worst”, but it still has an awful ring to it. And I know I’m being a little dramatic here, since only “9.1% of respondents truly hate trigonometry.” But that’s still too much shade being thrown for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to eliminate that 9.1%. So, in this series, I want to look at practical uses for CSS trigonometric functions. We’ll tackle them in pieces because there’s a lot to take in and I find it easiest to learn and retain information when it’s chunked into focused, digestible pieces. And we’ll start with what may be the most popular functions of the “worst” feature: &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;CSS Trigonometric Functions: The “Most Hated” CSS Feature&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt;(You are here!)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tackling the CSS &lt;code&gt;tan()&lt;/code&gt;Function (coming soon)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Inverse functions: &lt;code&gt;asin()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;acos()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;atan()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;atan2()&lt;/code&gt;(coming soon)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; anyway?&lt;/head&gt; What the heck are &lt;p&gt;This section is for those who &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; don’t quite click yet, or simply want a refresher. If you aced trigonometry quizzes in high school, feel free to skip ahead to the next section!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I find funny about &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt;— and also why I think there is confusion around them — is the many ways we can describe them. We don’t have to look too hard. A quick glance at this Wikipedia page has an eye-watering number of super nuanced definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a learning problem in the web development field. I feel like some of those definitions are far too general and lack detail about the essence of what trigonometric functions like &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; can do. Conversely, other definitions are overly complex and academic, making them tough to grok without an advanced degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s stick to the sweet middle spot: the unit circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the unit circle. It is a circle with a radius of one unit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now it’s alone… in space. Let’s place it on the Cartesian coordinate system (the classic chart with X and Y axes). We describe each point in space in Cartesian coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The X coordinate: The horizontal axis, plotting the point towards the left or right.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Y coordinate: The vertical axis, plotting the point towards the top or bottom.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can move through the unit circle by an angle, which is measured from the positive X-axis going counter-clockwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can go in a clockwise direction by using negative angles. As my physics teacher used to say, “Time is negative!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how each angle lands on a unique point in the unit circle. How else can we describe that point using Cartesian coordinates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the angle is &lt;code&gt;0°&lt;/code&gt; the X and Y coordinates are 1 and 0 (&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;), respectively. We can deduce the Cartesian coordinates for other angles just as easily, like &lt;code&gt;90°&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;180°&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;270°&lt;/code&gt;. But for any other angle, we don’t know where the point is initially located on the unit circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only there were a pair of functions that take an angle and give us our desired coordinates…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guessed it, the CSS &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; functions do exactly that. And they’re very closely related, where &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; is designed to handle the X coordinate and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; returns the Y coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play with the toggle slider in the following demo to see the relationship between the two functions, and notice how they form a right triangle with the initial point on the unit circle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that’s all you really need to know about &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; for the moment. They’re mapped to Cartesian coordinates, which allows us to track a point along the unit circle with an angle, no matter what size that circle happens to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into what we can actually use &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; for our everyday CSS work. It’s always good to put a little real-world context to theoretical concepts like math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Circular layouts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we go by the unit circle definition of &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt;, then it’s easy to see how they might be used to create circular layouts in CSS.  The initial setup is a single row of circular elements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say we want to place each circular item around the outline of a larger circle instead. First, we would let CSS know the total number of elements and also each element’s index (the order it’s in), something we can do with an inline CSS variable that holds each order in the position:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul style="--total: 9"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 0"&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 1"&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 2"&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 3"&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 4"&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 5"&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 6"&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 7"&amp;gt;7&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 8"&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note: This step will become much easier and concise when the &lt;code&gt;sibling-index()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sibling-count()&lt;/code&gt; functions gain support (and they’re really neat). I’m hardcoding the indexes with inline CSS variables in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To place the items around the outline of a larger circle, we have to space them evenly by a certain angle. And to get that angle, we can divide &lt;code&gt;360deg&lt;/code&gt; (a full turn around the circle) by the total number of items, which is 8 in this specific example. Then, to get each element’s specific angle, we can multiply the angle spacing by the element’s index (i.e., position):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;li {
  --rotation: calc(360deg / var(--total) * var(--i));
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also need to push the items away from the center, so we’ll assign a &lt;code&gt;--radius&lt;/code&gt; value for the circle using another variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ul {
  --radius: 10rem;
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have the element’s angle and radius. What’s left is to calculate the X and Y coordinates for each item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; come into the picture. We use them to get the X and Y coordinates that place each item around the unit circle, then multiply each coordinate by the &lt;code&gt;--radius&lt;/code&gt; value to get an item’s final position on the bigger circle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;li {
  /* ... */
  position: absolute;

  transform: translateX(calc(cos(var(--rotation)) * var(--radius))) 
             translateY(calc(sin(var(--rotation)) * var(--radius)));
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s it! We have a series of eight circular items placed evenly around the outline of a larger circle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we didn’t need to use a bunch of magic numbers to do it! All we provide CSS with is the unit circle’s radius, and then CSS does all the trigonometric gobbledygook that makes so many of us call this the “worst” CSS feature. Hopefully, I’ve convinced you to soften your opinions on them if that’s what was holding you back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren’t limited to full circles, though! We can also have a semicircular arrangement by choosing &lt;code&gt;180deg&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;360deg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opens up lots of layout possibilities. Like, what if we want a circular menu that expands from a center point by transitioning the radius of the circle? We can totally do that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click or hover the heading and the menu items form around the circle!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wavy layouts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s still more we can do with layouts! If, say, we plot the &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; coordinates on a two-axis graph, notice how they give us a pair of waves that periodically go up and down. And notice they are offset from each other along the horizontal (X) axis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do these waves come from? If we think back to the unit circle we talked about earlier, the value of &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; oscillate between &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, the lengths match when the angle around the unit circle varies. If we graph that oscillation, then we’ll get our wave and see that they’re sorta like reflections of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;⚠️ Auto-playing media&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we place an element following one of these waves? Absolutely. Let’s start with the same single row layout of circular items we made earlier. This time, though, the length of that row spans beyond the viewport, causing overflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll assign an index position for each item like we did before, but this time we don’t need to know the total number of items. We had eight items last time, so let’s bump that up to 10 and pretend like we don’t know that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 0"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 1"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 2"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 3"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 4"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 5"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 6"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 7"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 8"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 9"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li style="--i: 10"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We want to vary the element’s vertical position along either a &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; wave, meaning translating each item’s position based on its order in the index. We’ll multiply an item’s index by a certain angle that is passed into the &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; function, and that will return a ratio that describes how high or low the element should be on the wave. The final thing is to multiply that result by a length value, which I calculated as half  an item’s total size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the math in CSS-y terms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;li {
  transform: translateY(calc(sin(60deg * var(--i)) * var(--shape-size) / 2));
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m using a &lt;code&gt;60deg&lt;/code&gt; value because the waves it produces are smoother than some other values, but we can vary it as much as we want to get cooler waves. Play around with the toggle in the next demo and watch how the wave’s intensity changes with the angle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great example to see what we’re working with, but how would you use it in your work? Imagine we have two of these wavy chains of circles, and we want to intertwine them together, kinda like a DNA strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we’re starting with the HTML structure for two unordered lists nested inside another unordered list. The two nested unordered lists represent the two waves that form the chain pattern:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul class="waves"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;!-- First wave --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ul class="principal"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- Circles --&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 0"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 1"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 2"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 3"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- etc.  --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;!-- Second wave --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ul class="secondary"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- Circles --&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 0"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 1"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 2"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--i: 3"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- etc.  --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pretty similar to the examples we’ve seen so far, right? We’re still working with an unordered list where the items are indexed with a CSS variable, but now we’re working with two of those lists… and they’re contained inside a third unordered list. We don’t have to structure this as lists, but I decided to leave them so I can use them as hooks for additional styling later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid any problems, we’ll ignore the two direct &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements in the outer unordered list that contain the other lists using &lt;code&gt;display: contents&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.waves &amp;gt; li { display: contents; }&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice how one of the chains is the “principal” while the other is the “secondary.” The difference is that the “secondary” chain is positioned behind the “principal” chain. I’m using slightly different background colors for the items in each chain, so it’s easier to distinguish one from the other as you scroll through the block-level overflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can reorder the chains using a stacking context:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.principal {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}

.secondary { position: absolute; }&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This positions one chain on top of the other. Next, we will adjust each item’s vertical position with the “hated” &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; functions. Remember, they’re sorta like reflections of one another, so the variance between the two is what offsets the waves to form two intersecting chains of items:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.principal {
  /* ... */
  li {
    transform: translateY(calc(sin(60deg * var(--i)) * var(--shape-size) / 2));
  }
}

.secondary {
  /* ... */
  li {
    transform: translateY(calc(cos(60deg * var(--i)) * var(--shape-size) / 2));
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can accentuate the offset even more by shifting the &lt;code&gt;.secondary&lt;/code&gt; wave another &lt;code&gt;60deg&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.secondary {
  /* ... */
  li {
    transform: translateY(calc(cos(60deg * var(--i) + 60deg) * var(--shape-size) / 2));
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next demo shows how the waves intersect at an offset angle of &lt;code&gt;60deg&lt;/code&gt;. Adjust the slider toggle to see how the waves intersect at different angles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, I told you this could be used in a practical, real-world way. How about adding a little whimsy and flair to a hero banner:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Damped oscillatory animations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last example got me thinking: is there a way to use &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt;‘s back and forth movement for animations? The first example that came to mind was an animation that also went back and forth, something like a pendulum or a bouncing ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, trivial since we can do it in a single &lt;code&gt;animation&lt;/code&gt; declaration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.element {
  animation: someAnimation 1s infinite alternate;
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This “back and forth” animation is called oscillatory movement. And while &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt; are used to model oscillations in CSS, it would be like reinventing the wheel (albeit a clunkier one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that perfect oscillatory movement — like a pendulum that swings back and forth in perpetuity, or a ball that never stops bouncing — doesn’t really exist. Movement tends to decay over time, like a bouncing spring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;⚠️ Auto-playing media&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a specific term that describes this: damped oscillatory movement. And guess what? We can model it in CSS with the &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; function! If we graph it over time, then we will see it goes back and forth while getting closer to the resting position1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has another animated example that nicely demonstrates what damped oscillation looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, we can describe damped oscillation over time as a mathematical function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s composed of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;e−γt: Due to the negative exponent, it becomes exponentially smaller as time passes, bringing the movement to a gradual stop. It is multiplied by a damping constant (γ) that specifies how quickly the movement should decay.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a: This is the initial amplitude of the oscillation, i.e., the element’s initial position.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;cos(ωt−α): This gives the movement its oscillation as time passes. Time is multiplied by frequency (ω), which determines an element’s oscillation speed2. We can also subtract from time α, which we can use to offset the initial oscillation of the system.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough with all the theory! How do we do it in CSS? We’ll set the stage with a single circle sitting all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a few CSS variables we can define that will come in handy since we already know the formula we’re working with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:root {
  --circle-size: 60px;

  --amplitude: 200px; /* The amplitude is the distance, so let's write it in pixels*/
  --damping: 0.3;
  --frequency: 0.8;
  --offset: calc(pi/2); /* This is the same as 90deg! (But in radians) */
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given these variables, we can peek at what the animation would look like on a graph using a tool like GeoGebra:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the graph, we can see that the animation starts at &lt;code&gt;0px&lt;/code&gt; (thanks to our offset), then peaks around &lt;code&gt;140px&lt;/code&gt; and dies out around &lt;code&gt;25s&lt;/code&gt; in. I, for one, won’t be waiting 25 seconds for the animation to end, so let’s create a &lt;code&gt;--progress&lt;/code&gt; property that will animate between &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt;, and will act as our “time” in the function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that to animate or transition a custom property, we’ve gotta register it with the &lt;code&gt;@property&lt;/code&gt; at-rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@property --progress {
  syntax: "&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;";
  initial-value: 0;
  inherits: true;
}

@keyframes movement {
  from { --progress: 0; }
  to { --progress: 25; }
}&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s left is to implement the prior formula for the element’s movement, which, written in CSS terms, looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.circle {
  --oscillation: calc(
    (exp(-1 * var(--damping) * var(--progress))) * 
    var(--amplitude) * 
    cos(var(--frequency) * (var(--progress)) - var(--offset))
  );

  transform: translateX(var(--oscillation));
  animation: movement 1s linear infinite;
}&lt;/code&gt;







&lt;p&gt;This gives a pretty satisfying animation by itself, but the damped motion is only on the x-axis. What would it look like if, instead, we applied the damped motion on both axes? To do this, we can copy the same oscillation formula for x, but replace the &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.circle {
  --oscillation-x: calc(
    (exp(-1 * var(--damping) * var(--progress))) * 
    var(--amplitude) * 
    cos(var(--frequency) * (var(--progress)) - var(--offset))
  );
  --oscillation-y: calc(
    (exp(-1 * var(--damping) * var(--progress))) * 
    var(--amplitude) * 
    sin(var(--frequency) * (var(--progress)) - var(--offset))
  );

  transform: translateX(var(--oscillation-x)) translateY(var(--oscillation-y));
  animation: movement 1s linear infinite;
}&lt;/code&gt;







&lt;p&gt;This is even more satisfying! A circular and damped motion, all thanks to &lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt;. Besides looking great, how could this be used in a real layout?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to look too hard. Take, for example, this sidebar I recently made where the menu items pop in the viewport with a damped motion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty neat, right?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More trigonometry to come!&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, finding uses for the “most hated CSS feature” wasn’t that hard; maybe we should start showing some love to trigonometric functions. But wait. There are still several trigonometric functions in CSS we haven’t talked about. In the following posts, we’ll keep exploring what trig functions (like &lt;code&gt;tan()&lt;/code&gt; and inverse functions) can do in CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;CSS Trigonometric Functions: The “Most Hated” CSS Feature&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sin()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;cos()&lt;/code&gt;(You are here!)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tackling the CSS &lt;code&gt;tan()&lt;/code&gt;Function (coming soon)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Inverse functions: &lt;code&gt;asin()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;acos()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;atan()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;atan2()&lt;/code&gt;(coming soon)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, before I forget, here is another demo I made using cos() and sin() that didn’t make the cut in this article, but it is still worth checking out because it dials up the swirly-ness from the last example to show how wacky we can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This kind of damped oscillatory movement, where the back and forth is more visible, is called underdamped oscillation. There are also overdamped and critically damped oscillations, but we won’t focus on them here. ↪️&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;In reality, the damped constant and the frequency are closely related. You can read more about damped oscillation in this paper. ↪️&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two and a half years ago, I started my now longest real-world software experiment. I had read an article about how DOOMs engine works and noticed how a variable for tracking the demo kept being incremented even after the next demo started. This variable was compared with a second one storing its previous value. The issue here being, each incrementation would cause the variable to slowly get closer to an overflow, realistically this would never happen in a normal scenario, although it got me curious on just how long it would take until the game would crash due to this.&lt;lb/&gt; I did a few calculations, I don't remember the specifics of it sadly as it has been over two years since that point and I sadly did not document it back then (or I did, but on a partition I no longer have access to) but I remember having gotten roughly 2 1/2 years of possible runtime before an overflow. Obviously, I wanted to know if this would actually happen in the real game on real hardware.&lt;lb/&gt; So I set up DOOM on a small PDA, powered through a DIY 18650 based UPS which itself was connected to the USB port of my router for a constant 5V supply. I left the system running and mostly forgot about it.&lt;lb/&gt; ... Until today when I noticed a pop-up appearing on the device, not long ago from posting this to the board. The game had crashed, only hours after the two and a half year mark, proving that the variable did indeed overflow and cause the expected hard crash of the game: &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In a move to streamline development and strengthen our commitment to the open-source community, AMD is unifying its Linux Vulkan driver strategy and has decided to discontinue the AMDVLK open-source project, throwing our full support behind the RADV driver as the officially supported open-source Vulkan driver for Radeon™ graphics adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This consolidation allows us to focus our resources on a single, high-performance codebase that benefits from the incredible work of the entire open-source community. We invite developers and users alike to utilize the RADV driver and contribute to its future.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We are excited about this focused path forward and are committed to the continued success of open-source Vulkan on Radeon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slow social media&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People often assume that I hate social media. And they'd be forgiven for believing that, since I am overtly critical of current social media platforms and the effects they have on individuals and society; and deleted all of my social media accounts back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the underlying concept of social media is something I resonate with: Stay connected with the people you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's just that the current form of social media is bastardised, and not social at all. Instead of improving relationships and fostering connection, they're advertisement-funded content mills which are explicitly designed and continually refined to keep you engaged, lonely, and unhappy. And once TikTok figured out that short-form video with a recommendation engine is digital crack, all other social media platforms quickly sprang into action to copy their secret sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta basically turned Instagram and Facebook from 'connecting with friends' into 'doom-scrolling random content'. Even Pinterest is starting to look like TikTok! They followed user engagement, but not the underlying preferences of their users. I posit that any for-profit social media will eventually degrade into recommendation media over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think most people using these platforms understand that they are the product. Instagram isn't built for you. It's built for marketers. It's built for celebrities to capitalise on their audiences. It's built for politicians and their cronies to sway sentiment. It's built to be as addictive as possible, and to capitalise on your insecurity and uncomfortability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that, society and politics are on the rocks all so a fitness influencer can sell you their "Abs in 30 days" training program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These platforms are the quintessential poster child for late-stage capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, now that we've established what the problems with current platforms are—what would a non-evil social media platform look like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd love to see everyone running a blog, and subscribing to the people they care about via RSS. But unfortunately this doesn't scale since it requires effort to put your thoughts down in writing longer than 255 characters. I have many friends who don't even know I have a blog, or what an RSS reader is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So while everyone blogging may be the ideal we can aspire to, let's design a hypothetical social media platform that takes the good aspects of current social media, while creating pro-social incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The platform should be about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keeping up with friends, family, and other acquaintances&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connection (but, you know, real connection)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improving relationships&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thoughtful engagement&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The platform should NOT be about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collecting followers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Self-promotion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Advertising and marketing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Short-form video and media entertainment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, as soon as there is the ability for commercial interests to take hold, they will. The "follow" mechanism is a key part of that. I propose that instead of followers we should regress back to the "friend" or "connection" system where there is a symmetric relationship where both people have to agree to the connection. There is no good reason to have "followers" on a platform that is trying to improve relationships. "Following" is purely for egotistical or financial gain and breeds parasocial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there should also be a reasonable cap on the number of connections that can be made. Something like 300 friends sounds right. Any more than that and you're a collector, and not using the platform to foster connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature alone already removes 90% of the marketing interests in the platform. Do you want to make a connection, but are maxed out? You'll need to unfriend someone first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second necessary element would be a chronological feed with posts from your connections. This turns the platform from an engagement engine into a way to keep up with what everyone else is doing, but importantly, gives you a natural "end" to the feed when you start seeing posts you've already viewed. This way when you start scrolling there's an explicit stopping point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relatedly, pagination is more humane than infinite-scroll since it gives users a natural breathing point where they can decide whether they want to keep going. Infinite-scroll is such an obvious user-trap, and I view any website doing it as not having its user's best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, there should be a reasonable cap on the number of times a user can post per day. Roughly 5 times per day feels like the upper threshold of what you can post while being intentional about what it is you're posting. This will keep the feed reasonably populated without one or two people completely overwhelming it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the platform can be optimised to be as easy-to-use as possible. Something like a mixture between the old Instagram and Twitter, with comments and reactions. No reels or any other recommendation system to keep people engaged to death. And no analytics, since that would be optimising for reach and engagement instead of the stated goal of connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do I expect a platform like this to succeed? Not by the traditional metrics of success. In the real world it would exist alongside the content mills, which are exciting by design and competing for attention. Could it work in niche groups, or amongst intentional people who are sick of the current platforms? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, a project like this would have to be funded somehow, and unfortunately very few people are willing to pay $5 per month for software services, even if they use it every day. However, I suspect that a social media platform like this would be manageable enough that a small team could run it fairly cheaply and profitably if they're creative. Perhaps with nothing but donations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who will create this egalitarian social media? Not me, that's for sure. I already have my fair share of work moderating the Bear discovery feed, to the extent I've had to bring on a second moderator (hello Sheena!) to keep it clean of spam and other nasty things that free services on the internet attract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, I would love to see something like this. I'd love to be able to stay connected with friends and family abroad without having my attention sold to the highest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone is working on something like this, I'd be happy to consult.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;– the level of Societal Safety and Security,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;– and the degree of Militarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2025 Global Peace Index (GPI) reveals a continuing decline in global peacefulness, with many key indicators that precede major conflicts higher than at any time since World War II. Rising conflict deaths, accelerating geopolitical tensions, and middle power assertiveness are driving ‘The Great Fragmentation’ – a fundamental reshaping of the global order and marking the emergence of a new geopolitical era. When combined with major power competition, asymmetric warfare technologies, and mounting debt in fragile economies, the prospect for further conflict is high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Global Peace Index 2024 reveals that the world is at a crossroads. Without concerted effort, there is a risk of a surge in major conflicts. There are currently 56 conflicts, the most since World War II. They have become more international with 92 countries involved in conflicts outside their borders, the most since the GPI’s inception. The rising number of minor conflicts increases the likelihood of more major conflicts in the future. For example, in 2019, Ethiopia, Ukraine, and Gaza were all identified as minor conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• 97 countries deteriorated in peacefulness, more than any year since the inception of the Global Peace Index in 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • Conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine were the primary drivers of the global fall in peacefulness, as battle deaths reached 162,000 in 2023.&lt;lb/&gt; • 92 countries are currently involved in conflicts beyond their borders, more than at any time since the inception of the GPI.&lt;lb/&gt; • First of its kind military scoring system suggests that US military capabilities are up to three times higher than China.&lt;lb/&gt; • The global economic impact of violence increased to $19.1 trillion in 2023, representing 13.5% of global GDP. Exposure to conflict poses a significant supply chain risk for governments and businesses.&lt;lb/&gt; • Militarisation recorded its largest yearly deterioration since the inception of the GPI, with 108 countries becoming more militarised.&lt;lb/&gt; • 110 million people are either refugees or internally displaced due to violent conflict, with 16 countries now hosting more than half a million refugees.&lt;lb/&gt; • North America saw the largest regional deterioration, driven by increases in violent crime and fear of violence.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland, Ireland, Austria, New Zealand, and Singapore are the top 5 most peaceful countries in the world in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year recorded 162,000 conflict related deaths. This was the second highest toll in the past 30 years, with the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza accounting for nearly three-quarters of deaths. Ukraine represented more than half, recording 83,000 conflict deaths, with estimates of at least 33,000 for Palestine up to April 2024. In the first four months of 2024, conflict related deaths globally amounted to 47,000. If the same rate continues for the rest of this year, it would be the highest number of conflict deaths since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Global Peace Index 2022 results show that the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.03%. Although slight, this is the eleventh deterioration in peacefulness in the last fourteen years, with 90 countries improving, 71 deteriorating and two remaining stable in peacefulness, highlighting that countries tend to deteriorate much faster than they improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Deaths from external conflict recorded a sharp deterioration driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;lb/&gt; • Despite recent commitments, militarisation has improved in 113 countries since 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • Terrorism continued to improve, with 70 countries recording no attacks in 2021. This is the best result since 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • The rise in costs has increased food insecurity and political instability globally, with Africa, South Asia and the Middle East under greatest threat.&lt;lb/&gt; • The political terror scale, political insecurity, neighbouring country relations, refugees and IDPs reached their worst score since the inception of the GPI.&lt;lb/&gt; • The global economic impact of violence was $16.5 trillion in 2021, equivalent to 10.9% of global GDP, or $2,117 per person.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland remains the most peaceful country in 2022, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Ireland, Denmark and Austria.&lt;lb/&gt; • For the fifth consecutive year, Afghanistan is the least peaceful country, followed by Yemen, Syria, Russia and South Sudan.&lt;lb/&gt; • Seven of the ten countries at the top of the GPI are in Europe, and Türkiye is the only country in this region to be ranked outside the top half of the index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact of the War in Ukraine on Peacefulness&lt;lb/&gt; • Two of the five countries with the largest deteriorations in peacefulness were Russia and the Ukraine.&lt;lb/&gt; • Social media is changing the way intelligence is gathered – it is now shared instantaneously, raw and with little analysis.&lt;lb/&gt; • In contrast to the global trend, positive sentiment in the Ukraine was rising in 2021. Support for the West was strong, with 58% wanting to join a Western economic union, and 54% supporting joining NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;• Since 2008, the level of global peacefulness has deteriorated by 2%, with 75 countries recording a deterioration, while 86 improved.&lt;lb/&gt; • The average level of global peacefulness has deteriorated for nine of the past 13 years.&lt;lb/&gt; • The gap between the least and most peaceful countries continues to grow. Since 2008, the 25 least peaceful countries declined on average by 12.1%, while the 25 most peaceful countries improved by 4.3%.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world in 2021, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Denmark, Portugal, and Slovenia.&lt;lb/&gt; • Conflict in the Middle East has been the key driver of the global deterioration in peacefulness since 2008.&lt;lb/&gt; • Of the three GPI domains, two recorded a deterioration, while one improved. Ongoing Conflict deteriorated by 6.2% and Safety and Security deteriorated by 2.5%. However, Militarisation improved by 4.2%.&lt;lb/&gt; • The improving trend in Militarisation was widespread, with 111 of the 163 countries covered in the GPI improving. 87 countries reduced their military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, although military spending increased in absolute terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• The average level of global peacefulness deteriorated 0.34 per cent on the 2020 GPI. This is the ninth time in the last 12 years that global peacefulness has deteriorated.&lt;lb/&gt; • In the past year 80 countries recorded deteriorations in peacefulness, while 81 recorded improvements.&lt;lb/&gt; • The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world’s least peaceful region.&lt;lb/&gt; • Europe remains the most peaceful region in the world, although it recorded a slight deterioration in peacefulness.&lt;lb/&gt; • Iceland maintained the title of number one as the most peaceful country in 2020 since the first the Global Peace Index launched 13 years ago.&lt;lb/&gt; • Peacefulness improved on average on the Militarisation domain, but deteriorated on both the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains.&lt;lb/&gt; • The global economic impact of violence was $14.5 trillion PPP in 2019, equivalent to 10.6 per cent of global GDP or $1,909 per person.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Scavenging Trip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A downloadable game for Windows and Linux&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Scavenging Trip is a short and challenging simulation game were you are tasked with visiting an unknown planet, collect samples from its surface and leave in time. There are 3 missions with 3 difficulty levels each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A perfect speedrun through all difficulties should take around 10-15 minutes. A first playthrough might take 1-2 hours, especially because of the hardest difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is not a Save feature, as all missions are unlocked and there is not any kind of progression whatsoever (although the order of the missions puts them into context).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Controls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game uses minimal controls, which are rebindable through the Controls menu. Default scheme is WASDQE. Gamepads are currently not supported. The mouse is not used, so it's equivalently playable on a desktop or a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system requirements are very low; if you are able to open this web page on a modern browser then most probably you can run the game at &amp;gt;30 fps. Any GPU from the last 25 years should do. It's recommended to have a Pentium M or better processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supported and tested OSes are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows: 10 or newer (64 bit)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux: *buntu 18.04 or newer (32/64 bit)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More exotic builds are possible for OSes supported by SDL2 and a relatively recent version of the Rust compiler (for example BSDs, Windows 7).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some more technical info for the curious&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is developed using a custom software renderer and custom engine written in the Rust programming language. "Software" rendering in this context means that all graphics-related calculations are done by the CPU. The GPU is used only to present the final image to the display (and scale it depending on the window size).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You own a high-end ASUS ROG laptop perhaps a Strix, Scar, or Zephyrus. It's specifications are impressive: an RTX 30/40 series GPU, a top-tier Intel processor, and plenty of RAM. Yet, it stutters during basic tasks like watching a YouTube video, audio crackles and pops on Discord calls, the mouse cursor freezes for a split second, just long enough to be infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've likely tried all the conventional fixes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updating every driver imaginable, multiple times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performing a "clean" reinstallation of Windows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling every conceivable power-saving option.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manually tweaking processor interrupt affinities.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Following convoluted multi-step guides from Reddit threads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even installing Linux, only to find the problem persists.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If none of that worked, it's because the issue isn't with the operating system or a driver. The problem is far deeper, embedded in the machine's firmware, the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first tool in any performance investigator's toolkit for these symptoms is LatencyMon. It acts as a canary in the coal mine for system-wide latency issues. On an affected ASUS Zephyrus M16, the results are immediate and damning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CONCLUSION
Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. 
You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops.

HIGHEST MEASURED INTERRUPT TO PROCESS LATENCY
Highest measured interrupt to process latency (μs):   65,816.60
Average measured interrupt to process latency (μs):   23.29

HIGHEST REPORTED ISR ROUTINE EXECUTION TIME
Highest ISR routine execution time (μs):              536.80
Driver with highest ISR routine execution time:       ACPI.sys

HIGHEST REPORTED DPC ROUTINE EXECUTION TIME  
Highest DPC routine execution time (μs):              5,998.83
Driver with highest DPC routine execution time:       ACPI.sys
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data clearly implicates &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt;. However, the per-CPU data reveals a more specific pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CPU 0 Interrupt cycle time (s):                       208.470124
CPU 0 ISR highest execution time (μs):                536.804674
CPU 0 DPC highest execution time (μs):                5,998.834725
CPU 0 DPC total execution time (s):                   90.558238
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU 0 is taking the brunt of the impact, spending over 90 seconds processing interrupts while other cores remain largely unaffected. This isn't a failure of load balancing; it's a process locked to a single core.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar test on a Scar 15 from 2022 shows the exact same culprit: high DPC latency originating from &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easy to blame a Windows driver, but &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is not a typical driver. It primarily functions as an interpreter for ACPI Machine Language (AML), the code provided by the laptop's firmware (BIOS). If &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is slow, it's because the firmware is feeding it inefficient or flawed AML code to execute. These slowdowns are often triggered by General Purpose Events (GPEs) and traffic from the Embedded Controller (EC). To find the true source, we must dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand what &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is doing during these latency spikes, we can use Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to capture detailed logs from the ACPI providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Find the relevant ACPI ETW providers
logman query providers | findstr /i acpi
# This returns two key providers:
# Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Acpi {C514638F-7723-485B-BCFC-96565D735D4A}
# Microsoft-ACPI-Provider {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B}

# Start a comprehensive trace session
logman start ACPITrace -p {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B} 0xFFFFFFFF 5 -o C:\Temp\acpi.etl -ets
logman update ACPITrace -p {C514638F-7723-485B-BCFC-96565D735D4A} 0xFFFFFFFF 5 -ets

# Then once we're done we can stop the trace and check the etl file and save the data in csv format aswell.
logman stop ACPITrace -ets

    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the resulting trace file in the Windows Performance Analyzer reveals a crucial insight. The spikes aren't random; they are periodic, occurring like clockwork every 30 to 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Random interruptions often suggest hardware faults or thermal throttling. A perfectly repeating pattern points to a systemic issue, a timer or a scheduled event baked into the system's logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The raw event data confirms this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Clock-Time (100ns),        Event,                      Kernel(ms), CPU
134024027290917802,       _GPE._L02 started,          13.613820,  0
134024027290927629,       _SB...BAT0._STA started,    0.000000,   4
134024027290932512,       _GPE._L02 finished,         -,          6
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first event, &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;, is an interrupt handler that takes 13.6 milliseconds to execute. For a high-priority interrupt, this is an eternity and is catastrophic for real-time system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deeper in the trace, another bizarre behavior emerges; the system repeatedly attempts to power the discrete GPU on and off, even when it's supposed to be permanently active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Clock-Time,                Event,                    Duration
134024027315051227,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS0 start, 278μs     # GPU Power On
134024027315155404,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._DOS start, 894μs     # Display Output Switch
134024027330733719,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS3 start, 1364μs    # GPU Power Off
[~15 seconds later]
134024027607550064,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS0 start, 439μs     # Power On Again!
134024027607657368,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._DOS start, 1079μs    # Display Output Switch
134024027623134006,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS3 start, 394μs     # Power Off Again!
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This power cycling is nonsensical because the laptop is configured for a scenario where it is impossible: The system is in Ultimate Mode (via a MUX switch) with an external display connected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The discrete NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) is the only active graphics processor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is completely powered down and bypassed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The dGPU is wired directly to the internal and external displays.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is no mechanism for switching between GPUs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, the firmware is relentlessly trying to power cycle the dGPU every 15-30 seconds. The dGPU in mux mode isn't just "preferred" - it's the ONLY path to the display. There's no fallback, and no alternative. When the firmware sends &lt;code&gt;_PS3&lt;/code&gt; (power off), it's attempting something architecturally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the time, hardware sanity checks refuse these nonsensical commands, but even failed attempts introduce latency spikes causing audio dropouts, input lag, and accumulating performance degradation. Games freeze mid-session, videos buffer indefinitely, system responsiveness deteriorates until restart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, under specific thermal conditions or race conditions, the power-down actually succeeds. When the firmware manages to power down the GPU that's driving the display, the sequence is predictable and catastrophic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Firmware executes &lt;code&gt;_PS3&lt;/code&gt;- GPU power off command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardware complies - safety checks fail or timing aligns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display signal cuts - monitors go black&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User input triggers wake - mouse/keyboard activity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows calls &lt;code&gt;PowerOnMonitor()&lt;/code&gt;- attempt display recovery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NVIDIA driver executes &lt;code&gt;_PS0&lt;/code&gt;- GPU power on command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU enters impossible state - firmware insists OFF, Windows needs ON&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Driver thread blocks indefinitely - waiting for GPU response&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;30-second watchdog expires - Windows gives up&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System crashes with BSOD&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crash dump confirms the thread is stuck in &lt;code&gt;win32kbase!DrvSetWddmDeviceMonitorPowerState&lt;/code&gt;, waiting for the NVIDIA driver to respond. It can't because it's caught between a confused power state, windows wanting to turn on the GPU while the firmware is arming the GPU cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPEs are the firmware's mechanism for signaling hardware events to the operating system. They are essentially hardware interrupts that trigger the execution of ACPI code. The trace data points squarely at &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt; as the source of our latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A closer look at the timing reveals a consistent and problematic pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02 Event Analysis from ROG Strix Trace:

Event 1 @ Clock 134024027290917802
  Duration: 13,613,820 ns (13.61ms)
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks

Event 2 @ Clock 134024027654496591  
  Duration: 13,647,255 ns (13.65ms)
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks
  
Event 3 @ Clock 134024028048493318
  Duration: 13,684,515 ns (13.68ms)  
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks

Interval between events: ~36-39 seconds
Consistency: The duration is remarkably stable and the interval is periodic.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every single time the lengthy &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt; event fires, it triggers the exact same sequence of ACPI method calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern is undeniable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A hardware interrupt fires &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The handler executes methods to check battery status.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shortly thereafter, the firmware attempts to change the GPU's power state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The system runs normally for about 30-60 seconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cycle repeats.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyze the code responsible for this behavior, we must extract and decompile the ACPI tables provided by the BIOS to the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Extract all ACPI tables into binary .dat files
acpidump -b

# Output includes:
# DSDT.dat - The main Differentiated System Description Table
# SSDT1.dat ... SSDT17.dat - Secondary System Description Tables

# Decompile the main table into human-readable ACPI Source Language (.dsl)
iasl -d DSDT.dsl&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This decompiled ASL provides a direct view into the firmware's executable logic. It is a precise representation of the exact instructions that the ACPI.sys driver is fed by the firmware and executes at the highest privilege level within the Windows kernel. Any logical flaws found in this code are the direct cause of the system's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching the decompiled &lt;code&gt;DSDT.dsl&lt;/code&gt; file, we find the definition for our problematic GPE handler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Scope (_GPE)
{
    Method (_L02, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Lxx: Level-Triggered GPE
    {
        \_SB.PC00.LPCB.ECLV ()
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code is simple: when the &lt;code&gt;_L02&lt;/code&gt; interrupt occurs, it calls a single method, &lt;code&gt;ECLV&lt;/code&gt;. The "L" prefix in &lt;code&gt;_L02&lt;/code&gt; signifies that this is a level-triggered interrupt, meaning it will continue to fire as long as the underlying hardware condition is active. This is a critical detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the call to &lt;code&gt;ECLV()&lt;/code&gt;, we uncover a deeply flawed implementation that is the direct cause of the system-wide stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)  // Starting at line 099244
{
    // Main loop - continues while events exist OR sleep events are pending
    // AND we haven't exceeded our time budget (TI3S &amp;lt; 0x78)
    While (((CKEV() != Zero) || (SLEC != Zero)) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (TI3S &amp;lt; 0x78))
    {
        Local1 = One
        While (Local1 != Zero)
        {
            Local1 = GEVT()    // Get next event from queue
            LEVN (Local1)      // Process the event
            TIMC += 0x19       // Increment time counter by 25
            
            // This is where it gets really bad
            If ((SLEC != Zero) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (Local1 == Zero))
            {
                // No events but sleep events pending
                If (TIMC == 0x19)
                {
                    Sleep (0x64)    // Sleep for 100 milliseconds!!!
                    TIMC = 0x64     // Set time counter to 100
                    TI3S += 0x04    // Increment major counter by 4
                }
                Else
                {
                    Sleep (0x19)    // Sleep for 25 milliseconds!!!
                    TI3S++          // Increment major counter by 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Here's where it gets even worse
    If (TI3S &amp;gt;= 0x78)  // If we hit our time budget (120)
    {
        TI3S = Zero
        If (EEV0 == Zero)
        {
            EEV0 = 0xFF    // Force another event to be pending!
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This short block of code violates several fundamental principles of firmware and kernel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 1: Sleeping in an Interrupt Context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Sleep (0x64)    // 100ms sleep
Sleep (0x19)    // 25ms sleep&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interrupt handler runs at a very high priority to service hardware requests quickly. The &lt;code&gt;Sleep()&lt;/code&gt; function completely halts the execution of the CPU core it is running on (CPU 0 in this case). While CPU 0 is sleeping, it cannot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Process any other hardware interrupts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allow the kernel to schedule other threads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update system timers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 2: Time-Sliced Interrupt Processing The entire loop is designed to run for an extended period, processing events in batches. It's effectively a poorly designed task scheduler running inside an interrupt handler, capable of holding a CPU core hostage for potentially seconds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 3: Self-Rearming Interrupt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;If (EEV0 == Zero)
{
    EEV0 = 0xFF    // Forces all EC event bits on
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This logic ensures that even if the Embedded Controller's event queue is empty, the code will create a new, artificial event. This guarantees that another interrupt will fire shortly after, creating the perfectly periodic pattern of ACPI spikes observed in the traces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LEVN() method takes an event and routes it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (LEVN, 1, NotSerialized)
  {
      If ((Arg0 != Zero))
      {
          MBF0 = Arg0
          P80B = Arg0
          Local6 = Match (LEGA, MEQ, Arg0, MTR, Zero, Zero)
          If ((Local6 != Ones))
          {
              LGPA (Local6)
          }
      }
  }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LGPA() method is a giant switch statement handling different events:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (LGPA, 1, Serialized)  // Line 098862
{
    Switch (ToInteger (Arg0))
    {
        Case (Zero)  // Most common case - power event
        {
            DGD2 ()       // GPU-related function
            ^EC0._QA0 ()  // EC query method
            PWCG ()       // Power change - this is our battery polling
        }
        
        Case (0x18)  // GPU-specific event
        {
            If (M6EF == One)
            {
                Local0 = 0xD2
            }
            Else
            {
                Local0 = 0xD1
            }
            NOD2 (Local0)  // Notify GPU driver
        }
        
        Case (0x1E)  // Another GPU event
        {
            Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, 0xD5)  // Direct GPU notification
            ROCT = 0x55                  // Sets flag for follow-up
        }
       
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows a direct link: a GPE fires, and the dispatch logic calls functions related to battery polling and GPU notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PWCG()&lt;/code&gt; method, called by multiple event types, is responsible for polling the battery and AC adapter status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (PWCG, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    Notify (ADP0, Zero)      // Tell OS to check the AC adapter
    ^BAT0._BST ()            // Execute the Battery Status method
    Notify (BAT0, 0x80)      // Tell OS the battery status has changed
    ^BAT0._BIF ()            // Execute the Battery Information method  
    Notify (BAT0, 0x81)      // Tell OS the battery info has changed
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which we can see here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these operations requires communication with the Embedded Controller, adding to the workload inside the already-stalled interrupt handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NOD2()&lt;/code&gt; method sends notifications to the GPU driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (NOD2, 1, Serialized)
{
    If ((Arg0 != DNOT))
    {
        DNOT = Arg0
        Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, Arg0)
    }

    If ((ROCT == 0x55))
    {
        ROCT = Zero
        Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, 0xD1) // Hardware-Specific
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These notifications (&lt;code&gt;0xD1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xD2&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) are hardware-specific signals that tell the NVIDIA driver to re-evaluate its power state, which is what triggers the futile &lt;code&gt;_PS0/_DOS/_PS3&lt;/code&gt; power-cycling sequence seen in the traces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where a simple but catastrophic oversight in the firmware's logic causes system-wide failure. High-end ASUS gaming laptops feature a MUX (Multiplexer) switch, a piece of hardware that lets the user choose between two distinct graphics modes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimus Mode: The power-saving default. The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is physically connected to the display. The powerful NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) only renders demanding applications when needed, passing finished frames to the iGPU to be drawn on screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ultimate/Mux Mode: The high-performance mode. The MUX switch physically rewires the display connections, bypassing the iGPU entirely and wiring the NVIDIA dGPU directly to the screen. In this mode, the dGPU is not optional; it is the only graphics processor capable of outputting an image.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any firmware managing this hardware must be aware of which mode the system is in. Sending a command intended for one GPU to the other is futile and, in some cases, dangerous. Deep within the ACPI code, a hardware status flag named &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; is used to track this state. To understand the flaw, we first need to decipher what &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; means, and the firmware itself gives us the key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For screen brightness to work, the command must be sent to the GPU that is physically controlling the display backlight. A command sent to the wrong GPU will simply do nothing. Therefore, the brightness control method (&lt;code&gt;BRTN&lt;/code&gt;) must be aware of the MUX switch state to function at all. It is the firmware's own Rosetta Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Brightness control - CORRECTLY checks for mux mode
Method (BRTN, 1, Serialized)  // Line 034003
{
    If (((DIDX &amp;amp; 0x0F0F) == 0x0400))
    {
        If (HGMD == 0x03)  // 0x03 = Ultimate/Mux mode
        {
            // In mux mode, notify discrete GPU
            Notify (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.PEGP.EDP1, Arg0)
        }
        Else
        {
            // In Optimus, notify integrated GPU
            Notify (\_SB.PC00.GFX0.DD1F, Arg0)
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logic here is flawless and revealing. The code uses the &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; flag to make a binary decision. If &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0x03&lt;/code&gt;, it sends the command to the NVIDIA GPU. If not, it sends it to the Intel GPU. The firmware itself, through this correct implementation, provides the undeniable definition: &lt;code&gt;HGMD == 0x03&lt;/code&gt; means the system is in Ultimate/Mux Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This perfect, platform-aware logic is completely abandoned in the critical code paths responsible for power management. The &lt;code&gt;LGPA&lt;/code&gt; method, which is called by the stutter-inducing interrupt, dispatches power-related commands to the GPU without ever checking the MUX mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// GPU power notification - NO MUX CHECK!
Case (0x18)
{
    // This SHOULD have: If (HGMD != 0x03)
    // But it doesn't, so it runs even in mux mode
    If (M6EF == One)
    {
        Local0 = 0xD2
    }
    Else
    {
        Local0 = 0xD1
    }
    NOD2 (Local0)  // Notifies GPU regardless of mode
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the bug. The firmware, despite proving it knows how to check the MUX state, forgets to do so here. It blindly sends a power-management notification to the NVIDIA driver, instructing it to change power states. In MUX mode, this command is nonsensical it's asking the driver to power down the only GPU that is keeping the screen on. This triggers the futile power-cycling, the massive latency spikes, and the system instability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a single typo. A second, parallel power management system in the firmware exhibits the exact same flaw. The Platform Extension Plug-in Device (&lt;code&gt;PEPD&lt;/code&gt;) is used by Windows to manage system-wide power states, such as turning off displays during modern standby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Device (PEPD)  // Line 071206
{
    Name (_HID, "INT33A1")  // Intel Power Engine Plugin
    
    Method (_DSM, 4, Serialized)  // Device Specific Method
    {
        // ... lots of setup code ...
        
        // Arg2 == 0x05: "All displays have been turned off"
        If ((Arg2 == 0x05))
        {
            // Prepare for aggressive power saving
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.DHDW))
            {
                ^^PC00.PEG1.DHDW ()         // GPU pre-shutdown work
                ^^PC00.PEG1.DGCE = One      // Set "GPU Cut Enable" flag
            }
            
            If (S0ID == One)  // If system supports S0 idle
            {
                GUAM (One)    // Enter low power mode
            }
            
            ^^PC00.DPOF = One  // Display power off flag
            
            // Tell USB controller about display state
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.XHCI.PSLI))
            {
                ^^PC00.XHCI.PSLI (0x05)
            }
        }
        
        // Arg2 == 0x06: "A display has been turned on"
        If ((Arg2 == 0x06))
        {
            // Wake everything back up
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.DGCE))
            {
                ^^PC00.PEG1.DGCE = Zero     // Clear "GPU Cut Enable"
            }
            
            If (S0ID == One)
            {
                GUAM (Zero)   // Exit low power mode
            }
            
            ^^PC00.DPOF = Zero  // Display power on flag
            
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.XHCI.PSLI))
            {
                ^^PC00.XHCI.PSLI (0x06)
            }
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, the firmware prepares to cut power to the discrete GPU without first checking if it's the only GPU driving the displays. This demonstrates that the Mux Mode Confusion is a systemic design flaw. The firmware is internally inconsistent, leading it to issue self-destructive commands that try to cripple the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traces from multiple ASUS gaming laptop models confirm this is not an isolated issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trace Duration: 4.1 minutes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;Events: 7&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avg. GPE Duration: 1.56ms (lower, but still unacceptably high)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avg. Interval: 39.4 seconds (nearly identical periodic nature)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU Power Cycles: 8&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trace Duration: 19.9 minutes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;Events: 3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avg. GPE Duration: 2.94ms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU Power Cycles: 197 (far more frequent)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ASUS WMI Calls: 2,370 (a massive number, indicating software amplification)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a built-in "smooth video" check. It plays HD video in full screen and watches for hiccups. If the PC drops frames, crackles, or any driver pauses for more than a few milliseconds, it fails. That’s Microsoft’s baseline for what "smooth" should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it matters here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASUS firmware is causing millisecond-long pauses. Those pauses are exactly the kind that make this test fail i.e., the same stutters and audio pops regular users notice on YouTube/Netflix and games; this firmware violates fundemental standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being different models, all affected systems exhibit the same core flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;handlers take milliseconds to execute instead of microseconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GPEs trigger unnecessary battery polling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The firmware attempts to power cycle the GPU while in a fixed MUX mode.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The entire process is driven by a periodic, timer-like trigger.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This bug is a cascade of firmware design failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firmware's &lt;code&gt;ECLV()&lt;/code&gt; method treats a high-priority interrupt handler like a standard application thread, which is fundamentally incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What ASUS Wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    While (events_exist)
    {
        process_event();
        Sleep(100);         // FATAL FLAW: This blocks the entire CPU core.
        check_timers();
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What It Should Be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    // Acknowledge interrupt, queue work, and exit immediately.
    Local0 = EC0.EEV0;      // Read event source
    EC0.EEV0 = 0;           // Clear the event source
    QueueWorkForLater(Local0); // Queue a low-priority task
    Return;                 // Exit the handler in microseconds.
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firmware artificially re-arms the interrupt, creating an endless loop of GPEs instead of clearing the source and waiting for the next legitimate hardware event. This transforms a hardware notification system into a disruptive, periodic timer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code that sends GPU power notifications does not check if the system is in MUX mode, a critical state check that is correctly performed in other parts of the firmware. This demonstrates inconsistency and a lack of quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue is not new or isolated. User reports documenting identical symptoms with high ACPI.sys DPC latency, periodic stuttering, and audio crackling have been accumulating since at least 2021 across ASUS's entire gaming laptop lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 2021: The First Major Reports&lt;lb/&gt; The earliest documented cases appear on the official ASUS ROG forums. A G15 Advantage Edition (G513QY) owner reports "severe DPC latency from ACPI.sys" with audio dropouts occurring under any load condition. The thread, last edited in March 2024, shows the issue remains unresolved after nearly three years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reddit users simultaneously report identical ACPI.sys latency problems alongside NVIDIA driver issues; the exact symptoms described in this investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2021-2023: Spreading Across Models&lt;lb/&gt; Throughout this period, the issue proliferates across ASUS's gaming lineup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ROG Strix models experience micro-stutters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TUF Gaming series reports throttling for seconds at a time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;G18 models exhibit the characteristic 45-second periodic stuttering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2023-2024: The Problem Persists in New Models&lt;lb/&gt; Even the latest generations aren't immune:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2023 Zephyrus G16 owners report persistent audio issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2023 G16 models continue experiencing audio pops/crackles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2024 Intel G16 models require workarounds for audio stuttering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evidence is undeniable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Measured Proof: GPE handlers are measured blocking a CPU core for over 13 milliseconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Proof: The decompiled firmware explicitly contains &lt;code&gt;Sleep()&lt;/code&gt;calls within an interrupt handler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logical Proof: The code lacks critical checks for the laptop's hardware state (MUX mode).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systemic Proof: The issue is reproducible across different models and BIOS versions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until a fix is implemented, millions of buyers of Asus laptops from approx. 2021 to present day are facing stutters on the simplest of tasks, such as watching YouTube, for the simple mistake of using a sleep call inside of an inefficient interrupt handler and not checking the GPU environment properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code is there. The traces prove it. ASUS must fix its firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ASUS has not responded to this investigation or the documented firmware issues at the time of publication, will update this if anything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigation conducted using the Windows Performance Toolkit, ACPI table extraction tools, and Intel ACPI Component Architecture utilities. All code excerpts are from official ASUS firmware. Traces were captured on multiple affected systems, all showing consistent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In yet another troubling sign of these times, Peter Thiel can’t stop talking up the Antichrist. This month, the tech billionaire is delivering a four-part, closed-door lecture on the topic, which he is framing as “political theology,” in San Francisco. It’s part of what you might call an “Antichrist World Tour” by the PayPal and Palantir co-founder, who has already given off-the-record Antichrist lectures at Oxford, Harvard, and Bari Weiss’s ersatz college, the University of Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why Thiel needs secrecy to hold forth on his latest obsession. He’s been pontificating about the Antichrist in public talks for years. During a June interview with The New York Times, Thiel offered extended thoughts on the shadowy figure, barely mentioned in the Bible, who according to legend (and countless pulp horror movies) will arise to help Satan kick off Armageddon. He even named a suspect: Greta Thunberg. (The interview went viral when Thiel struggled to answer a question about whether he wants the human race to endure.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel is not a theologian, scholar, or prophet. So why pay attention to his biblical musings? Because Thiel is one of the world’s most influential men and his Antichrist speeches reveal his deep belief that religion is a weapon for political warfare—and he’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel’s Antichrist fixation fits a long tradition in American politics. Since the nation’s founding, Americans have sought to name the Antichrist—usually by pointing the finger at their political enemies. “The symbol of the Antichrist has played a surprisingly significant role in shaping Americans’ self-understanding,” wrote historian Robert Fuller in 1995’s Naming the Antichrist: The History of an American Obsession. “Because they tend to view their nation as uniquely blessed by God, they have been especially prone to demonize their enemies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the identity of Satan’s Little Helper has shifted from Native Americans to Communists, Hitler and Saddam Hussein and Barack Obama—even barcodes and microchips have been implicated. From colonial days to the AI era, the hunt for the Antichrist continues. Today’s QAnon conspiracy theorists believe they are battling a cabal of cannibalistic Satanists. Unhumans, a 2024 book praised by JD Vance, equated progressives with bloodthirsty “unhuman” creatures. This turns politics into a zero-sum holy war.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Once we label our adversaries in these cosmic terms—all good versus all evil—now there’s going to be no compromise,” said Fuller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel understands this. He frames his interest in the Antichrist as part of his own “political theology,” a term he borrows from Carl Schmitt, a Nazi philosopher who defined the practice of politics as a struggle against an existential enemy, arguing that politics is just religion in disguise. Thiel also draws on René Girard, a Catholic thinker (and one of Thiel’s Stanford professors) who warned that human societies tend to spiral toward violence in a hunt for scapegoats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s always a question of whether politics is like a market … or is it something like a scapegoating machine, where the scapegoating machine only works if you don’t look into the sausage factory?” Thiel said, during a 2024 talk at Stanford. He explained the mechanism: “If, say, we’re having a lot of conflicts in our village and we have to find some random elderly woman and accuse her of witchcraft so that we’ll achieve some psychosocial unity as a village … this sort of thing doesn’t really work if you’re self-aware.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel knows these dynamics well, but it’s not clear whether he’s horrified or impressed. His talks stop short of providing solutions. Instead, they meld Schmitt, Girard, and scripture into an incisive meditation on the power of apocalyptic ideas. Thiel positions himself as someone trying to help the world navigate a “narrow path” between Armageddon and Antichrist. But his rhetoric also sketches a playbook for holy war, scapegoating, crisis, and power—since Schmitt famously argued that power consolidates during existential crises, when constitutions can be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re told that there’s nothing worse than Armageddon, but perhaps there is,” said Thiel during a talk at Oxford in 2023. “Perhaps we should fear the Antichrist, perhaps we should fear the one-world totalitarian state more than Armageddon.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is already experimenting with this doomsday script: In January, he wrote an op-ed framing Donald Trump’s return to power as an “apokálypsis”—an “unveiling” of hidden truth and a chance to cleanse the nation’s “sins.” And in his religion talks, Thiel does not hesitate to name potential Antichrists, including Greta Thunberg, communism, and even tech regulation. This reveals a telling urge to wield scripture as political weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet his approach has major flaws. For example, Thiel claims the Antichrist will be someone focused on existential threats and apocalypse, and who will usher in a totalitarian world government under the slogan of “peace and safety.” But Thiel’s Antichrist checklist—a paranoid obsession with apocalypse, control, and surveillance—describes Thiel himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel co-founded Palantir, a software company literally named after an all-seeing orb controlled by an evil wizard in The Lord of the Rings. Palantir is partnering with the Trump administration to supercharge government surveillance at a moment when the president openly embraces authoritarianism. The irony is so striking it almost seems like a confession. As comedian Tim Dillon quipped on Joe Rogan’s podcast recently: “It’s so strange.… You build domestic surveillance technology to surveil our friends and neighbors—and then your other pet passion is the Antichrist.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel isn’t alone in mimicking religious themes. Billionaire Nicole Shanahan recently declared Burning Man “demonic,” while Andreessen Horowitz partner Katherine Boyle has invoked Christ’s crucifixion to argue that governments destroy families. Trae Stephens, a Thiel ally and self-proclaimed “arms dealer” who co-founded the drone warfare company Anduril (another warped Lord of the Rings reference), frames his work as part of a quest to “carry out God’s command to bring his Kingdom to earth as it is in Heaven.” Stephens’s wife, Michelle, co-founded ACTS 17 Collective (Acknowledging Christ in Technology and Society), which evangelizes to tech workers and is hosting Thiel’s Antichrist lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Russia, Alexander Dugin—an ultranationalist philosopher and propagandist known as “Putin’s brain”—is the only other major political figure who fixates on the Antichrist as much as Thiel. In Dugin’s version, Russia is at war with the Antichrist, which is liberal modernity emanating from the “country of apocalypse”—the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is convinced by Silicon Valley’s pivot to piety. At the National Conservatism Conference this month, some traditional religious conservatives railed against their would-be tech brethren. Conservative firebrand Geoffrey Miller blasted artificial intelligence developers as “betrayers of our species” and “apostates to our faith,” calling for what The Verge described as a “literal holy war” against tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, if we’re hunting for existential enemies, Silicon Valley’s diabolically greedy tech billionaires—who wish to create “godlike” AI systems powerful enough to destroy humanity—top the list. But we must avoid falling into the Antichrist name-calling trap. Instead of asking, “Who is the Antichrist?” we must ask, “Why is a tech billionaire trying to convince us we’re on the brink of apocalypse?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These rehashed Satanic panic tactics must be exposed for what they are: a cynical ploy to further inflame political divisions. It also seems like an awkward effort to cement an alliance with religious nationalists in the Republican Party, who also use apocalyptic language to frame their political goals. Journalist Matthew D’Ancona described Thiel’s Antichrist theories as a “highbrow version of MAGA End-Times theology.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But naming the Antichrist is a dangerous tactic that often leads to crisis and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The whole concept of the Antichrist … fosters a crisis mentality,” said Fuller, the Antichrist historian. “And with the crisis mentality, now we put aside all other differences. There’s a tribal cohesion, a tribal unity, and it justifies even immoral acts because, to defeat an evil enemy, a Satanic enemy, you must do whatever is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, in the hours after Charlie Kirk’s assassination, the words “demon” and “evil” trended on X as some on the right portrayed his murder as the work of supernaturally possessed Democrats and leftists. Major right-wing influencers echoed Carl Schmitt’s ideas, calling for a political crackdown on Kirk’s critics. Chris Rufo, a prominent right-wing propagandist, called on law enforcement to “infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate” the “radical left.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where apocalyptic rhetoric always leads. When political opponents become evil, cosmic enemies, persecution, and violence become a sacred duty. This surge in demon and devil talk showed that Thiel has correctly identified a potent but perilous impulse in our politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if tech billionaires seek to spread Christianity, they should stop hunting Antichrists and reflect on the words of Jesus Christ, who urged his followers to practice empathy and forgiveness and to care for people rather than exploit and surveil them. Instead of worrying about Armageddon, Thiel should heed the Gospels, which warn that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there’s scripture worth dwelling on—and it’s a problem that no AI, no surveillance, no power, no money can fix.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somehow along the way, a feature that I’ve had across DOS, OS/2, FreeBSD, and Linux — and has been present on PCs for more than 40 years — is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That feature, of course, is the 80×25 text console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux has, for awhile now, rendered its text console using graphic modes. You can read all about it here. This has been necessary because only PCs really had the 80×25 text mode (Raspberry Pis, for instance, never did), and even they don’t have it when booted with UEFI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve lately been annoyed that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The console is a different size on every screen — both in terms of size of letters and the dimensions of it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a given machine has more than one display, one or both of them will have parts of the console chopped off&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My system seems to run with three different resolutions or fonts at different points of the boot process. One during the initrd, and two different ones during the remaining boot.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, I wanted to run some software on the console that was designed with 80×25 in mind. And I’d like to be able to plug in an old VGA monitor and have it just work if I want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That shouldn’t be so hard, right? Well, the old vga= option that you are used to doesn’t work when you booted from UEFI or on non-x86 platforms. Most of the tricks you see online for changing resolutions, etc., are no longer relevant. And things like setting a resolution with GRUB are useless for systems that don’t use GRUB (including ARM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VGA text mode uses 8×16 glyphs in 9×16 cells, where the pixels are non-square, giving a native resolution of 720×400 (which historically ran at 70Hz), which should have streched pixels to make a 4:3 image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it is possible to select a console font, and 8×16 fonts are present and supported in Linux, it appears to be impossible to have a standard way to set 720×400 so that they present in a reasonable size, at the correct aspect ratio, with 80×25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tricks like nomodeset no longer work on UEFI or ARM systems. It’s possible that kmscon or something like it may help, but I’m not even certain of that (video=eDP1:720×400 produced an error saying that 720×400 wasn’t a supported mode, so I’m unsure kmscon would be any better.) Not that it matters; all the kmscon options to select a font or zoom are broken, and it doesn’t offer mode selection anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I’m going to have to track down an old machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
