    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is a very nerdy blog entry. It is about lightweight markup languages and why I think that Org mode syntax is the best lightweight markup language for many use-cases. And with lightweight markup language, I do mean the syntax, the way you express headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I've written a very similar article on why Markdown is a bad idea in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please do note that this is not about Emacs at all. This is about Org mode syntax and its advantages even when used outside of Emacs. You can type Org mode syntax in vim, notepad.exe, Atom, Notepad++, and all other text editors out there. And in my opinion it does have advantages compared to the other, common lightweight markup standards such as Markdown, AsciiDoc, Wikitext or reStructuredText.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, Org mode syntax is my favorite syntax. Despite my personal choice you will see that I've got some pretty convincing arguments that underline my statement as well. So this is not just a matter of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you already have a grin on your face because you don't have any clue what this is all about: keep on reading. It makes an excellent example for making fun of nerds at your next dinner party. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Org Mode Syntax Is Intuitive, Easy to Learn and Remember&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here you are. This is almost anything you need to know about Org mode syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;* This Is A Heading ** This Is A Sub-Heading *** And A Sub-Sub-Heading Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line. *bold* /italic/ _underlined_ +strikethrough+ =monospaced= [[http://Karl-Voit.at][Link description]] http://Karl-Voit.at â link without description - list item - another item - sub-item 1. also enumerated 2. if you like - [ ] yet to be done - [X] item which is done : Simple pre-formatted text such as for source code. : This also respects the line breaks. *bold* is not bold here.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; And yes, for the people with advanced syntax in mind, this is not everything. Just the basics. A common objection is that source code needs a begin and an end marker instead of a string prefix like &lt;code&gt;: &lt;/code&gt; and Org mode syntax is providing this as well:

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#+BEGIN_SRC python myresult = 42 * 23 print('Hello Europe! ' + str(myresult)) #+END_SRC&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen many coworkers who typed Org mode markup when taking notes in their text editor. And they did not even know anything about it. So it is that intuitive I'd say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I was learning Org mode, I did not even use a cheat-sheet for the syntax as I normally do. It was very natural for me to type Org mode syntax right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tables are a bit more complicated like in all other markup languages I know of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;| My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column | |-------------+-------------+-------------| | 42 | foo | bar | | 23 | baz | abcdefg | |-------------+-------------+-------------| | 65 | | |&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You most probably won't type a table like this outside of Emacs. The manual alignment without tool-support is very tedious. But even here you are able to deliver a perfectly fine Org mode table by simply ignoring the alignment altogether:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;| My Column 1|My Column 2 | Last Column | |- | 42 | foo | bar| | 23 | baz | abcdefg| |- | 65 |||&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Org Mode Syntax Is Standardized&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an almost ridiculous argument because in my opinion a markup is of no use when it is not the same for tool A as for tool B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there are markup languages that are different. For example the very widely used markup language named Markdown has many flavors to choose from (list far from complete):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the original writeup and implementation by John Gruber&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Markdown Extra&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MultiMarkdown&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GitHub Flavored Markdown&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CommonMark which tries to standardize the Markdown standard (again)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Djot (derived from CommonMark)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MyST (superset of CommonMark)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;by the time you read this, there probably will be even much more!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pandoc lists six different Markdown flavors as output formats. This is an absolutely bad situation which foils the original idea behind lightweight markup languages. When some web service tells me that I can use "Markdown" for a text field, I have to dig deeper to find out which of those many different Markdown standards the web page is talking about. After this I will have to continue and look for a cheat-sheet of this dialect because nothing is more difficult to differentiate than multiple standards that are almost the same but not really the same. A usability hell. I get furious every time I have to enter this hell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Markdown, the original (inconsistently designed) syntax format is a minimal set that made much sense when used when typing emails and so forth. Later-on, various tools needed more syntax elements for obvious reasons. For example, tools wanted to have footnotes or tables. Those syntax add-ons extended the original Markdown. However, they were not standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resulted in a zoo of very similar but incompatible set of Markdown flavors. Those differences cause information loss by moving from one "Markdown" tool to another "Markdown" tool because Markdown is not Markdown in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast to that, the syntax of Emacs Org-mode as the one and only original form has - by far - the largest set of syntax elements and various extensions by modules. Any other adaptation of this syntax in other tools chose a real sub-set of the original syntax elements. This makes data transitions much smoother, is less error-prone and causes less data loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of 2025-02, there is no formal Org-mode syntax definition. However, as described in the upper paragraphs, the Org-mode syntax is more standardized than any of the Markdown standards with respect to Markdown in general. All Org-mode syntax elements are part of the Emacs Org-mode implementation and all derivatives are sub-sets of this set of syntax elements. This is quite the opposite with Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; An additional notion (which is not related to the syntax itself) is the lack of standardization of file extensions using Markdown syntax. I've seen &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.mkdn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.markdown&lt;/code&gt; and even &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; (in Markdown).

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; With Org mode syntax, life is easy. The snippet from the previous section explains all there is. Any tool that interprets Org mode syntax accepts this simple and easy to remember syntax. The file name extension is always &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Org Mode Syntax Is Consistent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Different Heading Approaches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many lightweight markup languages do offer multiple ways of typing headings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are basically three ways of defining headings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefix headings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pre- and postfix headings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Underlined headings&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples for each category:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Prefix headings: # Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 Pre- and postfix headings: = Heading 1 = == Heading 2 == === Heading 3 === Underlined headings: Heading 1 ========= Heading 2 ~~~~~~~~~ Heading 3 *********&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I prefer the prefix heading style. Org mode syntax use this as well with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; as prefix characters. The more asterisks, the deeper the level of the heading is.

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Pre- and postfix headings do offer bad usability. The user has manually synchronize the number of prefix character with the number of postfix characters. And it is totally unclear how something like &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; with different numbers of pre/postfix characters is going to turn out when being interpreted.

&lt;code&gt; heading &lt;/code&gt;==&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in case the user already used a markup language with simple prefix headings, it is not logical why there is the need for the postfix characters at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even worse than this is the underlined heading category. The user is completely irritated for multiple reasons. Besides the tedious manual work to align the stupid heading characters with the heading title, it is not clear what characters must be used for those heading lines. If you've got a bigger document with different levels of headings you get confused which heading character stands for which heading level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are the tilde characters level one? Or was it the equals characters? And how about asterisks? Without a cheat-sheet, the occasional markup user is completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gets even more worse: some markup languages let you choose your "order" of heading characters. This results in weird situations. For example one author is starting to write a reStructuredText document using her favorite heading syntax. A second author is joining in and has to analyze the document in order to know what heading syntax he must use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the reStructuredText mode of Emacs you can find following function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;You can visualize the hierarchy of the section adornments in the current buffer by invoking&lt;code&gt;rst-display-adornments-hierarchy&lt;/code&gt;, bound on&lt;code&gt;C-c C-a C-d&lt;/code&gt;. A temporary buffer will appear with fake section titles rendered in the style of the current document. This can be useful when editing other people's documents to find out which section adornments correspond to which levels.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, you got it right, it is true: this function's only purpose is to generate a dummy-hierarchy of headings to visualize which markup has to be used for heading 1, which one for heading 2 and so forth just for this single document. What a bad design decision of the markup when you need such hacks just to know how a heading should look like in a markup even if you are familiar with in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is one more: some markup languages even allow mixed heading styles. You can use an underlined heading style for heading level 1, a prefix style for level 2, another underlining style for level 3 and so forth. Now the chaos is a perfect one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using this cheatsheet as reference for this section in AsciiDoc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Level 1 ------- Text. Level 2 ~~~~~~~ Text. Level 3 ^^^^^^^ Text. Level 4 +++++++ Text.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no good way of memorizing the characters used for the various levels of headings. Within the text, you can't see clearly which heading has a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have to manually align the characters below the heading text? Does it work when the heading text has a different length than the following line?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;== Level 1 Text. === Level 2 Text. ==== Level 3 Text. ===== Level 4 Text.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are there two different options for the same very basic syntax element? What about mixing them? Does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why don't they start with one eual sign? Level one consists of two equal characters and so forth. Why this off-by-one mismatch?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;* bullet * bullet - bullet - bullet * bullet ** bullet ** bullet *** bullet *** bullet **** bullet&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;- bullet * bullet&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again: why two different ways of writing a simple list?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First list version: Why do I have to use multiple asterisks but just one dash?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;a. letter b. letter .. letter2 .. letter2 . number . number 1. number2 2. number2 3. number2 4. number2 . number .. letter2 c. letter&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One letter, two dots, one dot â any logic seems to be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Term 1:: Definition 1 Term 2:: Definition 2 Term 2.1;; Definition 2.1 Term 2.2;; Definition 2.2 Term 3:: Definition 3 Term 4:: Definition 4 Term 4.1::: Definition 4.1 Term 4.2::: Definition 4.2 Term 4.2.1:::: Definition 4.2.1 Term 4.2.2:::: Definition 4.2.2 Term 4.3::: Definition 4.3 Term 5:: Definition 5&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definition indented or not? The level after the definition text is hard to follow in the layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;.Multiline cells, row/col span |==== |Date |Duration |Avg HR |Notes |22-Aug-08 .2+^.^|10:24 | 157 | Worked out MSHR (max sustainable heart rate) by going hard for this interval. |22-Aug-08 | 152 | Back-to-back with previous interval. |24-Aug-08 3+^|none |====&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that this has many table options that Org mode syntax does not provide such as multi-line cells. However, this comes with the price of a table syntax I would not be able to remember at least for occasional use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Web Links and Simple Markup in Different Markup Languages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at a different markup element: external links. As you already remember in Org mode syntax, a link looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[[http://Karl-Voit.at][my home page]]&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only difficult thing here is to remember that the URL is at the beginning and the description follows after the URL. Many markup languages do add additional and unnecessary levels of difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples from Wikipedia and comments by me where a user might be irritated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AsciiDoc:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;http://example.com[Text]&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The form is simple but for complex URLs, the &lt;code&gt;[Text]&lt;/code&gt; might look like being part of the URL itself. Not beautiful but at least something I could live with.

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[Text](http://example.com) [Text](http://example.com "Title")&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Brackets or parentheses first? Why using different kind of markup characters in the first place like only brackets? Is the &lt;code&gt;Title&lt;/code&gt; part of the URL? Why not part of &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;? Very confusing design decisions from my point of view.

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;reStructuredText:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;`Text &amp;lt;http://example.com/&amp;gt;`_&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Holy moly. This is some weird stuff. First, you have to grave accents &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt; and not apostrophes &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;. Then what about the underscore character at the end? This is as complicated as you can define a simple URL. I'd even prefer the hard to type HTML version of linking. A disaster for something which has "lightweight" in its class name.

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with the most basic formatting syntax, Markdown (I assume in all flavors of it) shows a high level of inconsistency:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;_italic_, **bold**, `monospace`, ~~strikethrough~~&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is it that italic and monospace require only one character before and after the string in-between and others require two? It's inconsistent and therefore hard to learn and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Markdown has even different formatting for the very same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This is **bold text**. This is __bold text__. Text**is**bold NOT allowed: Text__is__bold&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This is *italic*. This is _italic_. Text*is*italic NOT allowed: Text_is_italic&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Horizontal Rules with three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now compare the Org syntax for the same formats:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;/italic/, *bold*, ~monospace~, +strikethrough+ three or more dashes on one line for horizontal rules&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Org made different choices for the syntax. In my opinion with better mnemonics but you could disagree here. However, with one leading and one trailing syntax character, it's for sure easier to learn, type and recognize due to better consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Org Mode Syntax Can Be Easily Typed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simple syntax of Org mode does not imply typing unnecessary characters. You don't have to manually align something like underlined headings. Anybody using a simple text editor is very fast at adding markup for headings, font variations, and so forth. The previous section proved that other markup languages clearly fail in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Org Mode Syntax Makes Sense Outside of Emacs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't have to use the Emacs editor to write and work with Org mode markup text. As I mentioned above, many people already do so just because Org mode syntax is an intuitive and clean way of typing text characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you've got text information in Org mode markup, you can process it with many tools. Most prominent and most important examples are files pushed within a GitHub repository and the swiss army knife named Pandoc which is able to convert Org mode syntax to dozens of formats like HTML, odt (LibreOffice), docx (Word), LaTeX, PDF, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many lightweight markups don't come with any decent tool support at all. When I'm using, e.g., markdown in any solution that doesn't do more than syntax highlighting, there is no real reason why this can not be written in Org mode syntax instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, yes, Org mode syntax came with a perfect tool support in the first place. But my point is, that the syntax itself has that many advantages that is should be adapted for all the "tool-support is not the main focus"-applications as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can write and render Org mode syntax in GitHub and GitLab. You can and should use it in any text editor like Notepad for your personal notes. Especially when there is no tool support because of the "easy to type manually"-syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Org Mode Syntax Has Excellent Tool Support (If You Want)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the beginning, this is not an article about Emacs. Nevertheless for anybody not familiar with Emacs I have to mention that with Emacs there is a tool that supports (not only) in writing Org mode syntax in a perfect way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might start with mouse-only usage. There are menu items with all important functions. For the users that want to get a minimum of efficiency, the menu items show you the keyboard shortcuts you might want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; For Org mode syntax it is really easy to learn. Basically you just have to use &lt;code&gt;TAB&lt;/code&gt; for toggle the collapsing and expanding of headings, lists, and blocks. It's &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; and the arrow keys to move around headings, list items, and even table columns/rows. &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Return&lt;/code&gt; creates a new heading or list item without the need of entering the markup characters and manually matching indentation levels at all.

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it. With those three things you're good to write Org mode syntax efficiently. The basic file open/save, finding help, exiting Emacs stuff is accessible with icons or the menu. No need to learn more keyboard shortcuts if you don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having experienced this great tool-support, users typically are eager to learn more. You don't have to. You might be happy with Org mode for capturing minutes of meetings and your shopping list. However, others do master a few additional things and write whole eBooks within Org mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this article is not about Emacs, I want to explain why I mention the perfect Emacs support. My point is that Org mode deserves to be adopted for all kind of use-cases where a simple to read and simple to type lightweight markup is needed. However, if you want to have a decent tool support, there is no lightweight markup out there which has a better tool support compared to Org mode within Emacs. I did not find any tool support for Markdown, AsciiDoc, Wikitext or reStructuredText anywhere that could compete with the cozy Org mode syntax support within Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, there could be more tool support outside of emacs but this is my point: change this. This syntax should support more people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lightweight markup languages are designed to be used with a minimum effort compared to full-blown and therefore more complicated markup languages such as HTML or LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some are doing their job better than others. In my experience, many design decisions of widely adapted markups such as Markdown, AsciiDoc or reStructuredText (and others) are questionable from a usability point of view. At least I do have some issues when I have to use them in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I hardly see any people out there using Org mode syntax as a markup language outside of Emacs although there are very good reasons for it as an easy to learn and easy to use markup language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this blog article I wanted to point out the usefulness of Org mode even when you are not using Emacs as an writing tool. Of course, when you are using Emacs to type Org mode syntax, you get probably the most advanced tool-support for typing lightweight markup on top. But this was not the point of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update 2021-11-28: Due to the high demand and discussions of this article, the idea grew in me that we do have to address some issues of Org-mode mentioned here. Therefore, I came up with Orgdown. You should check out my Orgdown motivation article.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"revocation" has a valid point related to the missing standardization of Org mode. Here is my comment on this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statements here refer to a lightweight markup, the basic things of Org mode syntax. I explicitly listed "headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I do not cover here is a full syntax statement or standard. In my opinion, currently this is not possible outside of Emacs for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are variations in interpreting Org mode files between Emacs and pandoc. Also, pandoc only supports a sub-set of Org mode. Otherwise, pandoc would have to re-implement or embed Emacs for parsing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In this specific case, pandoc seems to have a more strict parser related to leading spaces for #-lines, or keywords. I'm pretty sure that the pandoc project accepts this issue as a bug. In doubt, the interpretation of Emacs is the definition, or golden-standard, of Org mode syntax. Even this beta-version of a syntax definition does not mention optional spaces before keywords. The manual mentions &lt;code&gt;org-element-parse-buffer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;org-lint&lt;/code&gt; which would be most probably the best choice for defining the official standard if you would search for one.

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this does not relate at all with the intention of this article: the design of the (basic) Org mode syntax compared to other lightweight markup languages. All the issues mentioned where other markups show inconsistencies and usability issues where Org mode seems to have advantages still do apply here. Completely independent of the standardization argument. My personal believe is, that if there would be more use of Org mode syntax elements outside of Emacs, there would be a much higher pressure on formally defining Org mode as a syntax which pandoc and even Emacs could use as the golden standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, there is not even the necessity of defining this golden standard because nobody outside of the Emacs community knows or even is using Org mode. And this is what I tried to change a bit because other markup languages do tend to hurt my geeky soul when I do have to use them. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comment by Ian Zimmerman&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ian wrote an email comment on reStructuredText (ReST):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Most of your argument makes at least some sense, but you miss the point of the ReST link syntax: the URL doesn't have to be inline! The normal style (which I use for my blog) is like this:&lt;code&gt;blah blah blah follow the interesting link at `foo`_ blah blah blah&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;more blah bluh bleh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;.. _foo: http ://www.foo.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;which among other things means that you can mention and link foo multiple times without repeating the URL.&lt;lb/&gt;Maybe there is a way of doing that in org - I don't know, I'm a total beginner. That's why I'm reading your post.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; (Note: I added an additional space character after &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; in the example above to work around this lazyblorg issue.)

&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, about that question related to defining an URL once and referring to it multiple times. I'm not aware of an Org mode feature that is providing this functionality except footnotes, which is not specific to URLs only. An even more general approach could be the use of very powerful macro replacement. However, discussion those things, we're far away from the discussion of markup that is lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, I acknowledge that I did not cover this possibility to define URL references in REsT markup. In my opinion and when I try to look at it from a hypothetic user perspective, I do think that this still proves my point. There is no logical explanation for that underscore character. I already had to add those back-ticks as syntax element. Why combining those back-ticks with an additional underscore? This does not make sense to me. Furthermore, where should I place this block where the URLs are defined? After each paragraph? Visual clutter. At the end of the text? Too fragile IMHO. And don't get me started on those two dots and the underscore switching places. This is certainly not putting more weight in the thought that ReST syntax has a higher level of logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For somebody looking for a smooth, easy to remember lightweight markup language, I still think that nothing beats Org mode in general. Even when we totally neglect the Emacs integration and 99 percent of its feature-set which allows for the most complex requirements while still being consistent and lightweight in syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that entire sections describing domestic U.S. intelligence facilities were deliberately removed from two published documents, while equivalent foreign facilities remained visible. The evidence exists in an unexpected place - the PDF metadata of documents published by The Intercept in 2016, and by The Intercept and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in a 2017 collaborative investigation. To our knowledge, this is the first time this information has been revealed publicly. The removed sections reveal the operational designations and cover name structure for domestic U.S. NRO Mission Ground Stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using PDF analysis tools, we found hidden text embedded in the metadata versioning of two documents published alongside investigative stories about NSA satellite surveillance facilities. These metadata artifacts prove that earlier versions of the documents contained detailed descriptions of domestic U.S. ground stations that were systematically scrubbed before publication (not just redacted with black boxes, but with text completely removed).&lt;/p&gt;What was published from the Snowden documents:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Operational details for RAF Menwith Hill Station (UK)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Operational details for Pine Gap (Australia)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS) - Washington, DC. Public cover name: "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center" (CWRTC).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS) - Denver area. Public cover name: "Aerospace Data Facility" (ADF).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facilities themselves are not unknown. "Aerospace Data Facility" at Buckley Space Force Base is publicly acknowledged as a National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Mission Ground Station. "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center" at Naval Research Laboratory is publicly acknowledged, though its designation as a Mission Ground Station is less clear. What's NOT public (until now) is the specific operational designations used in classified networks: "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)" and "Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)." The Snowden documents prove these are deliberate cover names (not just alternative terminology) and show exactly what's classified and what's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hidden PDF versions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first PDF document titled "Menwith satellite classification guide" has two versions in the file metadata: an older one and a newer one. The removed information exists in the earlier version, and is completely removed in the second, published version. This is not standard redaction with black boxes - the text was completely deleted from the visible document while remaining embedded in the PDF's internal version history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the first version of the document, containing the hidden text (sections 5.1.5.2 - 5.1.5.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the second version of the document, where the text is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removed text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;5.1.5.2 (U) Facility Name: Formally identified as the ,Mission Support Facility(MSF) also re- ferred as the Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC). 5.1.5.3 (S//TK) Cover Story: The fact of a cover story is S//TK, the cover story itself is unclas- sified. 5.1.5.4 (U) Software development, maintenance, testing, and communications support to a world-wide Navy communications and reporting system. 5.1.5.5 (U) Associations: 1. The term Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)=S//TK 2. The term Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)=UNCLASSIFIED 3. The term Naval Research Laboratory=UNCLASSIFIED 4. The fact that CWRTC is the cover name for the PMGS=S//TK 5. The fact that CWRTC is a communications and data relay location for the US=UNCLASSIFIED (no association w/NRO) 6.

Association of CWRTC with the ADF=UNCLASSIFIED (no association w/NRO) 5.1.5.6 (U) Visitors: CWRTC is housed within buildings 259 and 260 on the Naval Research Laboratory in Southwest Washington, DC.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second document "NRO SIGINT Guide for Pine Gap" also has two versions in the file metadata: an older one and a newer one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the first version of the document, containing the hidden text (section 5.1.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the second version of the document, where the text is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removed text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;5.1.2 (S//TK) Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS) 5.1.2.1 (U) Facility Name: Aerospace Data Facility (ADF) 5.1.2.2 (S//TK) Cover Story: The fact of a cover story is S/TK, the cover story itself is unclassi- fied.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the "hidden version" of the document "Menwith satellite classification guide" section 5.1.5 describes a facility formally identified by its cover name "Mission Support Facility (MSF)," also referred to as the "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)." The classified operational designation is Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: Buildings 259 and 260, Naval Research Laboratory, Southwest Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public cover story: "Software development, maintenance, testing, and communications support to a world-wide Navy communications and reporting system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual function: Mission Ground Station in the National Reconnaissance Office's satellite intelligence network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document explicitly states that "the fact of a cover story is S//TK" - meaning even acknowledging that CWRTC is a cover name (rather than the facility's real identity) is classified Secret/Talent Keyhole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classification guide provides a detailed breakdown of what's public and what's secret:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;"Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)" = UNCLASSIFIED&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;"Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)" = S//TK (SECRET)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The fact that CWRTC is a cover name for PMGS = S//TK (SECRET)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Association of NRO, CIA, or NSA personnel with CWRTC = S//TK (SECRET)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This layered classification allows the facility to operate under a public identity while keeping its actual intelligence designation and function secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the "hidden version" of the document "NRO SIGINT Guide for Pine Gap" section 5.1.2 describes a facility identified by the cover name "Aerospace Data Facility (ADF)". The classified operational designation is "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: Buckley Space Force Base, Aurora, Colorado&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public acknowledgment: Publicly known as "Aerospace Data Facility-Colorado." For example ADF-C is openly described in Wikipedia as an NRO facility for "command and control of reconnaissance satellites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's NOT public: The operational designation "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station" and the fact that "Aerospace Data Facility" is a cover name for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with PMGS, the classification guide shows "the fact of a cover story is S//TK" - the deception itself is classified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both hidden facilities appear in an organizational classification table in the Pine Gap guide. The table's visual structure reveals which names refer to the same facilities through deliberate formatting. Thicker borders separate distinct facility groups, while thinner borders separate columns within each group (this might be a bit hard to see from the screenshot/document). Each facility appears multiple times - once under its classified operational designation, and again under its unclassified cover name(s):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groupings show:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Denver facility: CDMGS (real designation) + ADF (cover name) + FSD (Field Station Denver, cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Potomac facility: PMGS (real designation) + MSF (cover name) + CWRTC (cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Menwith Hill: HMGS (real designation) + RAF MHS (cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pine Gap: AMGS (real designation) + JDFPG (cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each facility, the real operational designation (CDMGS, PMGS, HMGS, AMGS) has all agency associations classified S//TK (Secret). But the cover names have NSA and NGA associations marked as unclassified (U) or For Official Use Only (U//FOUO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a classification system where you can publicly acknowledge intelligence work using sanitized facility names, while the actual operational designations remain secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic facilities use two cover names each (ADF + FSD for Denver; MSF + CWRTC for Potomac), while foreign facilities use only one. This suggests layered operational security for facilities on U.S. soil - possibly to navigate Congressional oversight, legal restrictions on domestic intelligence operations, or different audiences requiring different levels of plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a deliberate pattern in these two classification guides: detailed sections describing specific U.S. facilities were removed, while equivalent foreign facility sections were published intact. The 2016 Menwith Hill guide had its PMGS section (5.1.5) completely removed. The 2017 Pine Gap guide had its CDMGS section (5.1.2) completely removed. Both guides retained their detailed descriptions of foreign facilities, including operational designations, cover stories, and visitor protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. facilities weren't entirely absent from the published documents. The Pine Gap classification table shows CDMGS, PMGS, ADF, and other U.S. facility designations alongside foreign facilities, revealing the structure of the Mission Ground Station network. Other published documents from both investigations mention U.S. facilities. What was specifically removed were the detailed classification guide sections that would have explained these U.S. facilities the same way Menwith Hill and Pine Gap were explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who edited the documents?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDF metadata provides forensic evidence of the editing process. The Pine Gap classification guide shows timestamps from July 31, 2017, three weeks before publication. Two versions were created minutes apart using Nitro Pro 8, a commercial PDF editor: version 1 at 13:48:54 (containing the CDMGS section) and version 2 at 13:50:48 (with CDMGS removed). The Intercept and ABC published identical PDFs with the same metadata artifacts, indicating the editing was done once and the same file shared between organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intercept, as holder of the Snowden archive, likely handled technical document preparation for publications. The Menwith Hill classification guide, published solely by The Intercept in 2016, shows more thorough metadata sanitization but the same editorial pattern - domestic facility sections removed while foreign equivalents remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We contacted Ryan Gallagher, the journalist who led both investigations, to ask about the editorial decision to remove these sections. After more than a week, we have not received a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next part will be a technical deep-dive into PDF metadata across the published Snowden documents. We found that many documents contain multiple versions in their metadata, revealing the editorial redaction process: visible NSA agents' usernames that were later removed, screenshots that were later redacted, and surveillance data that went through multiple rounds of redaction. We'll also document cases of failed redactions - including one where redacted text remained fully copyable, previously reported only by a Polish cybersecurity blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can extract versions from a PDF file for example with a pdfresurrect tool (pdfresurrect -w filename.pdf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can download the document versions directly here:&lt;/p&gt;Menwith satellite classification guide versions: NRO SIGINT Guide for Pine Gap versions:&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2023, Apple sunsetted (pun intended) the Dark Sky mobile app on iOS. Apple purchased the company behind the popular weather application in early 2020, then announced that it would be shutting down the Dark Sky applications (first on Android, then on iOS and web), and finally stated in 2022 that the forecast technology would be integrated into the Apple Weather app with iOS 16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dark Sky was much more than just an API or a set of “forecast technologies.” The design of the Dark Sky mobile application represented a hallmark of information design because the team clearly obsessed over how people would actually use the app on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a gallery of screenshots I personally took in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of Dark Sky was so wonderful that I could understand the shape of the weather at a glance, even from a zoomed out view of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common use cases for a weather app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we can dissect what makes the design of this app so special, let’s define the most common use cases for a weather app. A good weather app attempts to address a range of use cases in a person’s life. Here are some common use cases for a weather app, starting with the contextual goals first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the questions I want to answer vary based on the context and situation I’m in. This is the perfect situation for software that embraces good information design principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Magic Ink, Bret Victor defined information design “as the design of context-sensitive information graphics.” Unlike static graphics, like a weather map in a newspaper, information graphics in software can be highly dynamic and can incorporate context from the user’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky aggressively leaned into these ideas, and the team worked hard to turn nearly everything in the application into a context-sensitive information graphic. Let’s dive deeper into some examples where this notion is in full display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the day at a precise location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll start by listing my goals when trying to understand the upcoming weather for the day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default experience for the Dark Sky application is to show weather for the next 12 hours at my precise location. Here are three screenshots from the app, from different days and locations. What do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app contextualizes the information that’s presented based on what’s most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the left-most screenshot, the context of the weather storm that’s passing by my location and some potential light rain is emphasized to the user. The wind advisory and dip in the “feels like” temperature also make honorable mentions. In combination with the clickable Wind Advisory warning, I can quickly understand that the storm has passed my specific location but I should still be mindful of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the middle screenshot, the storm front heading my direction, the imminent rain starting within the hour, and the hours of rain later in the day are emphasized front and center. Based on my interest in the rain, I scrolled down (not shown in screenshot) to switch from temperature to rain probability for the main weather view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the right-most screenshot, the temperature distribution throughout the day is emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of little details that are easy to miss, as well. For example, all three screenshots above start showing weather information starting at the current moment (“now”) and onwards. This is brilliant, because I only occasionally care about weather from a few hours or days ago. (To accommodate those situations, the app did have a unique Time Machine view to explore past weather data.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the week&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit our goals when trying to understand the weather for the week:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many other weather apps focus on helping me understand the weather at the city level, the Dark Sky app differentiates itself by enabling me to understand the weather with a hyperlocal view. I can view the weather at specific addresses and landmarks and understand how the weather might be different in a city center compared to the towns around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the Dark Sky app shows the weekly weather summary at my current location (screenshot on the left). I can contextualize the weekly weather view by clicking the search icon and typing in the alternative location I’m interested in (screenshot on the right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a glance, I can quickly understand:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days are likely to rain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days have wide temperature ranges (low lows and high highs).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The general shape of the weather (micro-trends).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gallery of subtle design elements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first few sections, I laid the groundwork by diving a bit more deeply into specific aspects of Dark Sky. Now that I’ve hopefully engaged your critical design eye, I’d like to elevate other elements in the app’s design in a more rapid-fire fashion. I hope that this section will provide some ideas and inspiration for people designing their own data-rich applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preserving temperature magnitudes in ranges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To represent data visually, the data needs to be mapped from “data space” to “pixel space”. In some domains and scenarios, you want to ensure the magnitudes are carried over, and in others you want to rescale the values to a fixed scale so the resulting charts are more consistent in the space and pixels they take up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Dark Sky app, the “temperature pills” representing the forecasted temperatures for the upcoming week preserve their existing magnitude more effectively in the visualization. The temperature values are more tightly integrated with the visual representation, making the combined experience more amenable to quick comparison across multiple days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many weather apps opt for the design pattern on the right, where all temperature ranges are rescaled to take up the same amount of space in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing numbers with rough categories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interpreting hourly distributions of rainfall or snowfall can be difficult. Is 0.25 inches of rain a lot over the next hour? What about 0.2 inches of snow per hour for the next hour, then 0.15 for the hour after that? How do I prepare for these circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help users stay informed and take action, the app will often replace precise forecast distributions of rainfall and snowfall with rough categories instead. This design choice has two positive effects on users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It contextualizes the forecast to simpler categories that can help us quickly make changes in our life if needed. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Light snow that starts and stops means that my snow shoveling company won’t come out, but heavy snow means they likely will.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Heavy snow means I should probably make sure my outdoor furniture is better covered and ready to take the snow.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It removes a sense of artificial precision that doesn’t really exist because weather forecasts fundamentally have very high uncertainty and error bands.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contextualized storm map&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple color scales combined with arrows go a very long way to conveying relevant storm information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wind direction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of conveying wind direction using text (“NW” or “Northwest”), the app uses arrows! If the wind shifts directions throughout the day, I can feel the wind direction changing using my body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Complaints from former Dark Sky users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I could probably write an entire book about the design of Dark Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to share some passionate comments from other Dark Sky fans. While most of them aren’t data viz or design nerds, they feel that the Apple Weather app is not a sufficient replacement. These people relied on Dark Sky to make decisions and grew very attached to an application that integrated deeply into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0000GKP on Reddit: “I have already made the transition to the Weather app. The information is presented in a much less efficient manner than Dark Sky so it takes more effort to get it, but it is all there (except for cloud cover).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TheGeckoDude on Reddit: “Is there anything that has the precipitation graph similar to dark sky? The biggest thing I will miss from dark sky is that graph. I’m outside a lot and it is super helpful for knowing when to take cover or when it might rain. I need to find a feature like that because the vague weather precipitation info will not cut it for me.”&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s make data shine!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky started with publicly available data, augmented it with contextualized predictions, rigorously iterated on data visualization design, and packaged all of this into a contextualized experience to make weather data useful for me in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the availability of data has never been higher, we’re still missing software experiences that contextualize that data to make our lives better. Data alone isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world needs more Dark Sky-like experiences to help us improve our spending habits, help us sleep better, and more. If you’re working on information software, I hope you can be inspired by the body of design and engineering work that Dark Sky pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;NASA announces unprecedented return of sick ISS astronaut and crew&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA has announced the early return of Crew-11 from the International Space Station after an unidentified astronaut experienced a medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA has postponed a spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) and announced the early return of its crew due to a medical issue that arose on Wednesday (Jan. 7) with one of the astronauts on board, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spacewalk was planned for 8 a.m. ET on Thursday (Jan. 8) to finish preparing a power channel where a new solar array is set to be installed on the ISS. American astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman were scheduled to exit the space station for 6.5 hours in what would have been Cardman's first spacewalk. (Fincke has already performed nine spacewalks.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA did not name the crew member experiencing the medical problem or share any further details about the emergency, but the agency has confirmed that the issue involves one individual whose condition is stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely," a NASA spokesperson wrote in an email update on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the agency has confirmed it will bring Fincke, Cardman and two other astronauts, who are part of the current four-person crew aboard the ISS, home early from their stay at the orbital outpost. "Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11's mission," the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crew-11 arrived at the ISS on Aug. 2, 2025. Fincke and Cardman were joined by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Kimiya Yui and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov for a six-month mission, after which the astronauts were set to be replaced by Crew-12 as part of the space station's regular staffing rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crew-12's launch is scheduled for mid-February. It is unclear what returning Crew-11 home early would mean for the ISS, as such changes to the usual rotation are highly unusual, but there are other astronauts living on the space station at the moment — including NASA's Christopher Williams and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev, who arrived at the orbiting lab aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft that destroyed its launching pad in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;UK government exempting itself from flagship cyber law inspires little confidence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ministers promise equivalent standards just without the legal obligation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ANALYSIS From May's cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency to the Foreign Office breach months later, cyber incidents have become increasingly common in UK government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale extends far beyond these high-profile cases: the NCSC reports that 40 percent of attacks it managed between September 2020 and August 2021 targeted the public sector, a figure expected to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given this threat landscape, why does the UK's flagship Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill exclude both central and local government?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sir Oliver Dowden, former digital secretary and current shadow deputy PM, led calls in the House of Commons this week urging Labour to rethink its stance on excluding central government from the Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I would just urge the minister, as this bill passes through Parliament, to look again at that point, and I think there is a case for putting more stringent requirements on the public sector in order to force ministers' minds on that point."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CSR bill was announced days into Sir Keir Starmer's tenure as Prime Minister, aiming to provide an essential refresh of the country's heavily outdated NIS 2018 regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It proposed to bring managed service providers into scope, as was scheduled in 2022 before those plans fell by the wayside, and datacenters, among many other aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallels can be drawn with the EU's NIS2. However, the CSR bill's scope is narrower, excluding public authorities, unlike the EU's equivalent regulatory refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ian Murray, minister of state across two government departments and responsible, in part, for data policy and public sector reform, thanked Dowden for his suggestions and promised to take them on board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In responding to the shadow deputy PM, Murray also pointed to the Government Cyber Action Plan, which it launched hours before the CSR bill was set for a second reading in the Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This plan will ostensibly hold government departments to equal security standards as the CSR bill... just without any of the legal obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynics may see it as a tool to quell any criticisms of the bill's scope not extending to central government, all without making any hard security commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Dowden noted in the Commons on Tuesday, cybersecurity is a matter that is often deprioritized quickly in government. "I welcome the minister's comments about the obligation on the public sector. However, I would caution him that, in my experience, cybersecurity is one of those things that ministers talk about but then other priorities overtake it. And the advantage of legislative requirements is that it forces ministers to think about it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I do think that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on ministers in terms of their accountability for cybersecurity. I fear that if we don't put this into primary legislation, it's something that can slip further and further down ministers' in-trays. Whilst [some] ministers may have a desire to address it, other, more pressing, immediate problems distract their attention."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could argue that if the government is serious about holding itself to the same standards as the critical service providers in scope of the CSR bill, it would just bring itself and local authorities also into scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neil Brown, director at British law firm decoded.legal, told The Register: "The argument is that government departments will be held to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, and so do not need to be included. This does not fill me with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"If the government is going to hold itself to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, then it has nothing to fear from being included in the bill since, by definition, it will be compliant."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labour MP Matt Western, who also chairs the National Security Strategy joint committee, suggested that the CSR bill would not be a cure-all, but the first of many pieces of bespoke legislation the government will pass to improve national security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests the government is considering specific legislation to shore up public sector security further down the line. Perhaps this is wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UK's Cyber Security and Resilience Bill makes Parliamentary debut&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UK tech minister booted out in weekend cabinet reshuffle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UK threatens £100K-a-day fines under new cyber bill&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Revamped UK cybersecurity bill couldn't come soon enough, but details are patchy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brown told us "separate legislation does not sound like a terrible idea," and notes that existing UK telecoms law is separated for effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, for example, both seek to improve security in the telco space, but target different organizations. Security requirements often differ between types of organization, so potentially reserving a public sector-specific cybersecurity bill could be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ministers' plans also include a provision in the bill to introduce new legislative amendments as needed, to meet the demands of a rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape, leaving behind the Brexit-related hindrances that delayed the previous NIS updates in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the likelihood of being able to deliver on effective legislative amendments at pace is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arguably, if the government wanted to do it correctly, it would carry out a comprehensive (and lengthy) industry consultation before pushing any amendments through the two Houses, another typically arduous process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether this way of iterating on existing law could balance speed with comprehensiveness in unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Brown, the approach taken by Labour – to legislate in smaller steps – seems like the smarter choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"My preference is to legislate little and often, iterating as needed, rather than trying to create one piece of legislation which is all things to all people," he says. "Legislation inevitably entails compromise, and often reflects the divergent interests of numerous interested parties (including lobbying groups) – I look, for instance, at the Online Safety Act 2023. Smaller bills/acts, more targeted in scope, responding to a clearly-articulated problem statement, seems more sensible to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As to whether the CSR would result in a better outcome than NIS2, I'm afraid I do not know."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the scale of the cyber threat facing the UK's public sector, failing to account for this in the CSR bill could open the government up to intense scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The National Audit Office's report into UK government security improvements in January 2025 laid bare the sorry state of its systems. Of the 72 most critical systems run by various departments, 58 were reviewed; auditors found a litany of security flaws across them and noted a staggeringly slow pace at which the issues were being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is not an assessment which goes hand-in-hand with a public sector free from regular cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each time a central authority, arm's-length body, local council, or NHS trust is compromised, the government's decision not to include the public sector within the scope of the CSR bill hands the opposition another opportunity to question its commitment to cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labour does, at least, have some ammo to fire back if this scenario were to ever become reality, with the Conservatives having failed to enact the cybersecurity recommendations from its 2022 consultation, despite having had more than two years to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with the government's Cyber Action Plan, its reluctance to bring the public sector into the scope of its flagship cyber legislation fails to inspire any confidence that it has serious ambitions to improve security in this problem area. ®&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I replaced Windows with Linux and everything’s going great&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux diary, chapter one: winging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux diary, chapter one: winging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In November, I got fed up and said screw it, I’m installing Linux. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS without spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s increasingly annoying OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that only works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Day one&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I picked CachyOS rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the installation instructions in the Cachy wiki and download the CachyOS live image to a Ventoy USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like Pop_OS! and Mint, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on Arch, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the Dual Boot Diaries podcast — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a 4TB storage drive with just over a terabyte of data on it, so I shrink that partition down to 2TB using the installer’s manual partitioning interface, then (following the guide) make a 2GB boot partition and a root partition using the btrfs file system. The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I have to pick one of thirteen different desktop environments. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE. I could rabbit-hole on this, but I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then I just have to pick a username and password and name the computer. After some thought, I go with Maggie, after my in-laws’ cat, who half the family calls Linux. She doesn’t answer to either name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation takes six minutes. I reboot the computer, and it loads into the Limine bootloader, which has also found my Windows install, so I can choose between Cachy and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I’m on the Cachy desktop, and my mouse buttons still aren’t working. Swapping USB ports doesn’t do anything. Plugging in my trackball doesn’t fix it either. I finally try unplugging the mouse, which makes the trackball work normally. My gaming mouse is an ancient Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7; it turns out this is a known issue. I defer editing configuration files for now and just keep the mouse unplugged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stuff that works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That weird mouse aside, all of the hardware I’ve tried so far has just worked. Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s missing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers. Firefox and Chromium will do. I can’t find official apps for Airtable (which I use for work), Spotify, or Apple Music, but they all work fine in the browser in the short term, and I’ll revisit this later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shall we play a game?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cachy has a one-click gaming package install that includes the Proton compatibility layer, Steam, and Heroic (a launcher for Epic, GOG, and Amazon). I figure I ought to try one game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading The Outer Worlds, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that only works for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The children yearn for the mines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I’ve had so far is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. For some reason, Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making a Linux version of Bedrock. Java Edition works fine in Linux, but I play Minecraft with my kids, and they’re on Bedrock Edition on their iPads. There’s supposed to be a way to run the Android app with MCPE Launcher, but I couldn’t get it to work. There’s also a project to get the Windows version running on Proton, which will be my next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stuff I haven’t tried yet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear good things about howdy, a Linux equivalent to Windows Hello face authentication, but I haven’t installed it yet. I hear the Zen browser is a good Arc alternative. I also haven’t gotten my cloud storage synced, configured git so I can compile programs from scratch, figured out a backup strategy, or tried much other hardware beyond what’s currently plugged into my computer. There’s a command-line Spotify player I want to try. I’ve only scratched the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did take the time to install a KDE Plasma theme that makes it look like Windows XP, though. Just because.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Regret level: none&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m well aware this is the honeymoon phase. And using Linux for less than a week isn’t exactly a flex. Many people use Linux. And I haven’t even tried doing anything particularly difficult, or playing a game that came out this decade. But so far it’s been a much easier transition than expected, and a quieter experience overall. My OS isn’t trying to change my browser or search engine to make some shareholder happy somewhere. It’s not nudging me to try some bullshit AI feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will I go crawling back to macOS or Windows the first time I have to edit a batch of photos? Possibly! I’ll definitely boot back into Windows — or pull out a Chromebook — to play Minecraft with my kids, if I can’t get it running on Linux. And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use Linux exclusively; my job as a reviews editor means I have to stay familiar with as many operating systems as possible. (This is a good way to drive yourself nuts.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll run into plenty of fun problems soon enough. But the first few days have been great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Voltair builds drones that ‘perch’ like birds to recharge on power lines. For this first time, this allows for drones with infinite range. Removing battery swaps is the last step to deploy UAVs autonomously at scale. After building drones for the Air Force and DARPA, Ronan realized this was both practical and technically feasible. Power utilities are the perfect first customer. Drone inspections identify maintenance concerns before they cause faults. Faults cause power outages, and spark wildfires - like the Eaton Fire in early 2025 where 19 people lost their lives and nearly 10,000 structures were destroyed. Fires bankrupt utilities and make them uninsurable. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost. Since June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles. After power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate and other inspection markets. Insurance and grid traders also want our data product. At scale we are a new infrastructure layer for data on the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI is a business model stress test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI commoditizes anything you can specify. It can't commoditize what you have to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind Labs laid off 75% of its engineering team last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adam Wathan, CEO of Tailwind Labs, spent the holidays running revenue forecasts. In a GitHub comment, he explained what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story circulating is that AI is killing Open Source businesses. I don't think that is quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI didn't kill Tailwind's business. It stress tested it. Their business model failed the test, but that is not an indictment of all Open Source business models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind's business model worked for years. It relied on developers visiting their documentation, discovering Tailwind Plus while browsing, and buying it. Tailwind Plus is a $299 collection of pre-built UI components. Traffic led to discovery, and discovery drove sales. It was a reasonable business model, but always fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last year, more and more developers started asking AI for code instead of reading documentation, and their sales and marketing funnel broke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a fairness issue here that I don't want to skip past. AI companies trained their models on Tailwind's documentation and everything the community wrote about it. And now those models generate Tailwind code and answer Tailwind questions without sending anyone to Tailwind's website. The value got extracted, but compensation isn't flowing back. That bothers me, and it deserves a broader policy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I keep coming back to is this: AI commoditizes anything you can fully specify. Documentation, pre-built card components, a CSS library, Open Source plugins. Tailwind's commercial offering was built on "specifications". AI made those things trivial to generate. AI can ship a specification but it can't run a business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does value live now? In what requires showing up, not just specifying. Not what you can specify once, but what requires showing up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value is shifting to operations: deployment, testing, rollbacks, observability. You can't prompt 99.95% uptime on Black Friday. Neither can you prompt your way to keeping a site secure, updated, and running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why Vercel created Next.js and gives it away for free. The Open Source framework is the conduit; the hosting is the product. Same with Acquia, my own company. A big part of Acquia's business model is selling products around Drupal: hosting, search, CI/CD pipelines, digital asset management, and more. We don't sell describable things; we sell operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Source was never the commercial product. It's the conduit to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked what to pivot to, Wathan was candid: "Still to this day, I don't know what we should be pivoting to". I've written about how digital agencies might evolve, but CSS frameworks and component libraries are a harder case. Some Open Source projects make for great features, but not great businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind CSS powers millions of sites. The framework will survive. Whether the company does is a different question. I'm rooting for them. The world needs more successful Open Source businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In northern Germany, researchers have filmed brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) leaping from cave ledges to catch bats mid-flight — the first evidence that rodents can intercept flying mammals. The finding, published in Global Ecology and Conservation, turns one of ecology’s everyday characters into an unexpectedly agile predator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The behavior was recorded at Segeberg Kalkberg, a limestone cave that shelters around 30,000 hibernating bats each winter. Using infrared video over five weeks in autumn 2020 and thermal cameras from 2021 to 2024, a team led by Florian Gloza-Rausch in Bad Segeberg captured footage that’s unusual, for sure: a rat balancing on its hind legs at the cave entrance, sensing the movement of wings in the dark, then springing up to seize a bat from the air.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across five weeks of monitoring, the researchers confirmed 13 kills and found a hidden cache of 52 bat carcasses — clear signs that the rats weren’t scavenging leftovers but hunting deliberately. At that rate, a small group of rats could wipe out about 7% of the bat population in a single season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s remarkable for an animal not built for flight or pursuit. Brown rats are omnivores that typically scavenge or prey on slow-moving targets. Yet here, they appear to have developed two hunting strategies: aerial interception at the cave mouth and ground attacks on bats crawling to roost. How the rats locate their targets in near-darkness isn’t fully clear, but researchers suspect they use whisker and hearing cues rather than sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar: Brain-Wide Map Shows How Prior Knowledge Guides Mouse Decisions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study describes this as unexpected behavioral plasticity in brown rats. The researchers believe the dense streams of bats and the narrow cave geometry created the perfect ambush zone — a place where a patient predator could learn a new trick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery also adds a new stressor to European bat populations, which are already under pressure from habitat loss and disease. Because brown rats are invasive across much of the continent, their access to major hibernation sites could have lasting ecological effects. The authors suggest managing rat presence near large roosts as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the most compelling part of the finding lies not in its numbers but in its image: a common city rat, usually seen raiding bins, now standing alert in a cave mouth, hunting with precision that blurs the line between scavenger and specialist. It’s a reminder that adaptation doesn’t always unfold in distant rainforests — sometimes it happens under our own streetlights, in ways no one thought to look for.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Finding and Fixing Ghostty's Largest Memory Leak&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, users started reporting that Ghostty was consuming absurd amounts of memory, with one user reporting 37 GB after 10 days of uptime. Today, I'm happy to say the fix has been found and merged. This post is an overview of what caused the leak, a look at some of Ghostty's internals, and some brief descriptions of how we tracked it down.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leak was present since at least Ghostty 1.0, but it is only recently that popular CLI applications (particularly Claude Code) started producing the correct conditions to trigger it at scale. The limited conditions that triggered the leak are what made it particularly tricky to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix is merged and is available in tip/nightly releases, and will be part of the tagged 1.3 release in March.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The PageList&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand the bug, we first need to understand how Ghostty manages terminal memory. Ghostty uses a data structure called the &lt;code&gt;PageList&lt;/code&gt;
to store terminal content. PageList is a doubly-linked list of
memory pages that store the terminal content (characters, styles, hyperlinks,
etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The underlying "pages" are not single virtual memory pages but they are a contiguous block of memory aligned to page boundaries and composed of an even multiple of system pages.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These pages are allocated using &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; isn't particularly fast,
so to avoid constant syscalls, we use a memory pool. When we need
a new page, we pull from the pool. When we're done with a page, we return
it to the pool for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pool uses a standard size for pages. Think of it like buying standard-sized shipping boxes: most things people ship fit in a standard box, and having a standard box comes with various efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But sometimes terminals need more memory than a standard page provides. If a set of lines has many emoji, styles, or hyperlinks, we need a larger page. In these cases, we allocate a non-standard page directly with &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, bypassing the pool entirely. This is typically a
rare scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we "free" a page, we apply some simple logic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the page is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= standard size&lt;/code&gt;: return it to the pool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the page is &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; standard size&lt;/code&gt;: call&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;to free it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the core background for terminal memory management in Ghostty, and the idea itself is sound. A logic bug around an optimization is what produced the leak, as we'll see next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Scrollback Optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's one more background detail we need to cover to understand the bug: scrollback pruning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ghostty has a &lt;code&gt;scrollback-limit&lt;/code&gt; configuration that caps how much history
is retained. When you hit this limit, we delete the oldest pages in
the scrollback buffer to free up memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this often happens in a super hot path (e.g. when outputting large amounts of data quickly), and allocating and freeing memory pages is expensive, even with the pool. Therefore, we have an optimization: reuse the oldest page as the newest page when we reach the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This optimization works great. It requires zero allocations and uses only some quick pointer manipulations to move the page from the front to the back of the list. We do some metadata cleanup to "clear" the page but otherwise leave the previous memory intact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fast and empirically speeds up scrollback-heavy workloads significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the scrollback pruning optimization, we always resized our page back to standard size. But we didn't resize the underlying memory allocation itself, we only noted the resize in the metadata. The underlying memory was still the large non-standard &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; allocation, but now the PageList thought it was standard
sized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, we'd free the page under various circumstances (e.g. when the user closes the terminal, but also other times). At that point, we'd see the page memory was within the standard size, assume it was part of the pool, and we would never call &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt; on it.
A classic leak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all seems pretty obvious, but the issue is that non-standard pages are rare by design. The goal of our design and optimizations is that standard pages are the common case and provide a fast-path. Only very specific scenarios produce non-standard pages and they're usually not produced in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the rise of Claude Code changed this. For some reason, Claude Code's CLI produces a lot of multi-codepoint grapheme outputs which force Ghostty to regularly use non-standard pages. Additionally, Claude Code uses the primary screen and produces a significant amount of scrollback output. These things combined together created the perfect storm to trigger the leak in huge quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be explicit that this bug is not Claude Code's fault. Claude Code is simply exercising Ghostty in a way that exposes this long-standing bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix is conceptually simple: never reuse non-standard pages. If we encounter a non-standard page during scrollback pruning, we destroy it properly (calling &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;) and allocate a fresh
standard-sized page from the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of the fix is in the snippet below, but some extra work was needed to fix up some other bits of accounting we have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (first.data.memory.len &amp;gt; std_size) {
    self.destroyNode(first);
    break :prune;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could've also reused the non-standard page and just retained the large memory size, but until we have data that shows otherwise, we're still operating under the assumption that standard pages are the common case and it makes sense to reset back to a standard pooled page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other users have recommended more complex strategies (e.g. maintaining some metrics on how often non-standard pages are used and adjusting our assumptions accordingly), but more research is needed before making those changes. This change is simple, fixes the bug, and aligns with our current assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finding the Leak with VM Tags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the fix, I added support for virtual memory tags on macOS provided by the Mach kernel. This lets us tag our PageList memory allocations with a specific identifier that shows up in various tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;inline fn pageAllocator() Allocator {
    // In tests we use our testing allocator so we can detect leaks.
    if (builtin.is_test) return std.testing.allocator;

    // On non-macOS we use our standard Zig page allocator.
    if (!builtin.target.os.tag.isDarwin()) return std.heap.page_allocator;

    // On macOS we want to tag our memory so we can assign it to our
    // core terminal usage.
    const mach = @import("../os/mach.zig");
    return mach.taggedPageAllocator(.application_specific_1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now when debugging memory on macOS, Ghostty's PageList memory shows up with a specific tag instead of being lumped in with everything else. This made it trivial to identify the leak, associate it with the PageList, and also verify that the fix worked by observing the tagged memory being properly freed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preventing Leaks in Ghostty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do a lot of work in the Ghostty project to find and prevent memory leaks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In debug builds and unit tests, we use leak-detecting Zig allocators.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CI runs &lt;code&gt;valgrind&lt;/code&gt;on our full unit test suite on every commit to find more than just leaks, such as undefined memory usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We regularly run the macOS GUI via macOS Instruments to look for leaks particularly in the Swift codebase.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We run every GTK-related PR using Valgrind (the full GUI) to look for leaks in the GTK codepath that isn't unit tested.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has worked really well to date, but unfortunately it didn't catch this particular leak because it only triggers under very specific conditions that our tests didn't reproduce. The merged PR includes a test that does reproduce the leak to prevent regressions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the largest known memory leak in Ghostty to date, and the only reported leak that has been confirmed by more than a single user. We'll continue to monitor and address memory reports as they come in, but remember that reproduction is the key to diagnosing and fixing memory leaks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thanks to @grishy who finally got me a reliable reproduction so I could analyze the issue myself. Their own analysis reached the same conclusion as mine, and the reproduction let me verify both our understandings independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks also to everyone who reported this issue with detailed diagnostics. The community's analysis, especially around the &lt;code&gt;footprint&lt;/code&gt; output and
VM region counting, gave me important clues that pointed toward the PageList
as the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bichon is an open-source email archiving system that synchronizes emails from IMAP servers, indexes them for full-text search, and provides a REST API for programmatic access. Unlike email clients, Bichon is designed for archiving and searching rather than sending/receiving emails. It runs as a standalone server application that continuously synchronizes configured email accounts and maintains a searchable local archive. Built in Rust, it requires no external dependencies and provides fast, efficient email archiving, management, and search through a built-in WebUI. Its name is inspired by the puppy my daughter adopted last month.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I released rustmailer, an email API middleware:&lt;lb/&gt; https://github.com/rustmailer/rustmailer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve received many emails asking whether it could also archive emails, perform unified search, and support full-text indexing—not just querying recipients.&lt;lb/&gt; But rustmailer was designed as a middleware focused on providing API services.&lt;lb/&gt; Adding archiving and full-text search would complicate its core purpose and go far beyond its original scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I realized that email archiving itself only requires a small portion of rustmailer’s functionality, plus a search engine.&lt;lb/&gt; With that combination, building a dedicated, efficient archiver becomes much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the experience gained from rustmailer, I designed and built Bichon in less than two weeks, followed by another two weeks of testing and optimization.&lt;lb/&gt; It has now reached a stable, usable state—and I decided to release it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bichon is completely free.&lt;lb/&gt; You can download and use it however you like.&lt;lb/&gt; It’s not perfect, but I hope it brings you value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Pull the image
docker pull rustmailer/bichon:latest

# Create data directory
mkdir -p ./bichon-data

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name bichon \
  -p 15630:15630 \
  -v $(pwd)/bichon-data:/data \
  -e BICHON_LOG_LEVEL=info \
  -e BICHON_ROOT_DIR=/data \
  rustmailer/bichon:latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting from v0.1.4, Bichon changes how &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt; works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt;is not set, Bichon now allows all origins. This makes local testing and simple deployments much easier.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you do set &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt;, then you must explicitly list each allowed origin.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;is not supported and will not work — you must provide exact URLs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a browser accesses Bichon, it will send an &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incoming Origin = the exact address the browser is using&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configured origins = the list you passed to &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Configured origins does not contain the Incoming Origin exactly as a full string match, the browser request will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example debug log:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2025-12-06T23:56:30.422+08:00 DEBUG bichon::modules::rest: CORS: Incoming Origin = "http://localhost:15630"
2025-12-06T23:56:30.422+08:00 DEBUG bichon::modules::rest: CORS: Configured origins = ["http://192.168.3.2:15630"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser is using &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:15630&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;But the configured origin is &lt;code&gt;http://192.168.3.2:15630&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ CORS will fail, and you can immediately see why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is strongly recommended to configure CORS in production environments to ensure that only trusted browser origins can access Bichon. If you want to access Bichon from a browser:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add the exact IP with port&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or the exact hostname with port&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or the domain (port optional if it's 80)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://192.168.1.16:15630
http://myserver.local:15630
http://mydomain.com
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you access Bichon in multiple different ways, list all of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS="http://192.168.1.16:15630,http://myserver.local:15630,http://mydomain.com"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not add a trailing slash (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://192.168.1.16:15630/&lt;/code&gt;will not match)&lt;p&gt;Do not use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, it is not supported.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set environment variable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BICHON_LOG_LEVEL=debug
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or via command-line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;--bichon-log-level debug
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default is &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt;, so CORS logs will not appear unless debug logging is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Note: If you are running Bichon in a container (via Docker Compose or docker run), be careful with quotes in environment variable values.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, do not write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The outer quotes (&lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;) will be passed literally into the container and may cause CORS misconfiguration.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correct way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or using YAML literal style for Docker Compose:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;environment:
  BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS: |
    http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ensures that the configured origins are interpreted correctly inside the container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Note: This fucking problem I actually didn’t know about myself; thanks to gall-1 for pointing it out.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the appropriate binary for your platform from the Releases page:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Windows: &lt;code&gt;bichon-x.x.x-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extract and run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Linux/macOS
./bichon --bichon-root-dir /tmp/bichon-data

# Windows
.\bichon.exe --bichon-root-dir e:\bichon-data&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;--bichon-root-dir argument is required and must be an absolute path.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are accessing Bichon from a proxy domain mydomain argument --bichon-cors-origins="https://mydomain" is required.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the following documentation for detailed instructions on how to set the Bichon encryption password:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👉 https://github.com/rustmailer/bichon/wiki/Setting-the-Bichon-Encryption-Password&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All configuration methods, including command-line options, environment variables, and password file support (v0.2.0+), are documented there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting from Bichon v0.2.0, the authentication model has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bichon no longer uses the legacy single-account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;root / root&lt;/code&gt;login.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The system now ships with a built-in admin user by default.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Default credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Username: &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Password: &lt;code&gt;admin@bichon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Username: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legacy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;account and the&lt;code&gt;root / root&lt;/code&gt;default credentials no longer exist.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;From v0.2.0 onward, access-token–based authentication is always enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The startup flag and environment variable &lt;code&gt;--bichon-enable-access-token&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;BICHON_ENABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;are deprecated and no longer used.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No additional configuration is required to enable authentication.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After logging in, the admin user can manage their profile directly in the WebUI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Log in to the WebUI using the default admin credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Navigate to Settings → Profile.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Username&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Password&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Avatar and other profile information&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you already have existing emails stored as EML or MBOX files, you can import them into Bichon using the &lt;code&gt;bichonctl&lt;/code&gt; CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Index historical emails&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform full-text search immediately&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manage imported data just like synced IMAP emails&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We have collected a real-world case study from a user processing email data, which demonstrates Bichon's performance and storage efficiency in a live environment. This case involves ingesting and indexing data from 126 email accounts. The total original data volume was 229 GB, comprising 460,000 emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A special thank you to @rallisf1 for sharing this usage scenario and the detailed data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data is provided solely as a reference for real-world usage. We encourage more users to share their Bichon usage screenshots and metrics (e.g., ingestion volume, compression ratio, search speed, etc.) to help the community conduct a more comprehensive assessment of Bichon's suitability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To build or contribute to Bichon, the following environment is recommended:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust: Use the latest stable toolchain for best compatibility and performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js: Version 20+ is required.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pnpm: Recommended package manager for the WebUI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/rustmailer/bichon.git
cd bichon&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd web
pnpm install
pnpm run build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the WebUI in development mode if needed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pnpm run dev&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the WebUI is built, return to the project root:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd ..
cargo build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or run directly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export BICHON_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD=dummy-password-for-testing
cargo run -- --bichon-root-dir e:\bichon-data&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--bichon-root-dir&lt;/code&gt; specifies the directory where all Bichon data will be stored.
&lt;code&gt;BICHON_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; is the password used to encrypt the sensitive data (see &lt;code&gt;cargo run -- --help&lt;/code&gt; for alternative ways to specify this).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The WebUI runs on http://localhost:15630 by default.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HTTPS is not enabled in development or default builds.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is licensed under AGPLv3.&lt;/p&gt;

Although widely described as an "electric car", Sinclair characterised it as a "vehicle, not a car".[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair had become one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, on the back of the highly successful Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but the development of the follow-up C10 and C15 models never progressed further than the drawing board, mostly due to the poor public response to the C5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 10 January 1985, the C5 was unveiled at a glitzy launch event, but it was received less than enthusiastically by the British media. Its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by consumer and motoring organisations. The vehicle's limitations – a short range, a maximum speed of only 15 miles per hour (24 km/h), a battery that ran down quickly and a lack of weatherproofing – made it impractical for most people's needs. It was marketed as an alternative to cars and bicycles, but ended up appealing to neither group of owners, and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch. Within three months of the launch, production had been slashed by 90%. Sales never picked up despite Sinclair's optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by August 1985. Out of 14,000 C5s made, only 5,000 were sold before its manufacturer, Sinclair Vehicles, went into receivership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C5 has been described as "one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry"[3] and a "notorious ... example of failure".[4] Despite its commercial failure, the C5 went on to become a cult item for collectors. Thousands of unsold C5s were purchased by investors and sold for hugely inflated prices, as much as £6,000 compared to the original retail value of £399. Enthusiasts have established owners' clubs and some have modified their vehicles substantially, adding bigger wheels, jet engines, and high-powered electric motors to propel their C5s at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The C5 is made predominantly of polypropylene, measuring 174.4 cm (68.7 in) long, 74.4 cm (29.3 in) wide, and 79.5 cm (31.3 in) high. It weighs approximately 30 kg (66 lb) without a battery and 45 kg (99 lb) with one.[5] The chassis consists of a single Y-shaped steel component with a cross-section of about 5.5 by 4 cm (2.2 by 1.6 in)[6] The vehicle has three wheels, one of 317 mm (12.5 in) diameter at the front and two of 406 mm (16.0 in) at the rear.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The driver sits in a recumbent position in an open cockpit, steering via a handlebar that is located under the knees. A power switch and front and rear brake levers are positioned on the handlebar. As a supplement to or replacement for electric power, the C5 can also be propelled via bicycle-style pedals located at the front of the cockpit. The maximum speed of an unmodified C5 is 15 miles per hour (24 km/h). At the rear of the vehicle is a small luggage compartment with a capacity of 28 litres (1 cu ft).[5] As the C5 does not have a reverse gear, reversing direction is done by getting out, picking up the front end and turning it around by hand.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C5 is powered by a 12-volt lead–acid electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor would not be able to move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient.[6] Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals.[8] As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it was usually billed as an electric vehicle, the C5 also depends significantly on pedal power. The vehicle's battery is designed to provide 35 amps for an hour when fully charged or half that for two hours, giving the C5 a claimed range of 20 miles (32 km).[6] A display in the cockpit uses green, amber, and red LEDs to display the state of the battery charge. The segments are extinguished one after the other to indicate how much driving time is left. The last light indicates that only ten minutes of power are left, after which the motor is switched off and the driver is left to rely on the pedals. Another display indicates via green, amber, and red LEDs how much current is being used. The C5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current, indicated by the green LEDs, is being used. When the lights are red, the motor is under a high load and the driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown.[9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C5 was initially sold at a cost of £399, but to keep the cost under the £400 mark a number of components were sold as optional accessories.[10] These included indicator lights, mirrors, mud flaps, a horn, and a "High-Vis Mast" consisting of a reflective strip on a pole, designed to make the C5 more visible in traffic. Sinclair's C5 accessories brochure noted that "the British climate isn't always ideal for wind-in-the-hair driving" and offered a range of waterproofs to keep C5 drivers dry in the vehicle's open cockpit. Other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries.[11]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;History&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Origins&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Sir Clive Sinclair's interest in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solartron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he was the head of his own successful electronics company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.[12]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair took the view that an electric vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor was the key to the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child's scooter, with a button on the handlebars to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair's development of the first "slimline" pocket calculator – the Sinclair Executive and its successors – took precedence. No further work on electric vehicles took place for most of the rest of the 1970s.[12]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Early development: the C1&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;It was not until late 1979 that Sinclair returned to electric vehicle development. Around Christmas that year, he approached Tony Wood Rogers, an ex-Radionics employee, to carry out consultancy work on "a preliminary investigation into a personal electric vehicle".[13] The brief was to assess the options for producing a one-person vehicle which would be a replacement for a moped and would have a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). Although Wood Rogers was initially reluctant, he was intrigued by the idea of an electric vehicle and agreed to help Sinclair.[14] The vehicle was dubbed the C1 (the C standing for Clive). He built a number of prototypes to demonstrate various design principles and clarify the final specifications.[13]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A specification of the C1 emerged by the end of the year. It would address short-distance transportation needs, with a minimum range of 30 miles (48 km) on a fully charged battery. This reflected official figures showing that the average daily car journey was only 13 miles (21 km), while the average moped or pedal cycle journey was just 6 miles (10 km). The users were envisaged as being housewives, urban commuters, and young people, who might otherwise use cycles or mopeds to travel. The electric vehicle would be safer, more weather-proof, and would offer space to carry items. It would be easy to drive and park and for the driver to enter or exit, and it would require minimum maintenance. The vehicle would be engineered for simplicity using injection-moulded plastic components and a polypropylene body. It would also be much cheaper than a car, costing £500 (equivalent to £1,900 in 2023) at the most.[15]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area of development that Sinclair purposely avoided was battery technology. Electric vehicles powered by lead–acid batteries had once actually outnumbered internal combustion engine vehicles; in 1912 nearly 34,000 electric cars were registered in the U.S.[16] However, the efficiency of internal combustion engines greatly improved while battery technology advanced much more slowly, leading to petrol and diesel-driven vehicles dominating the market.[17] By 1978, out of 17.6 million registered vehicles on Britain's roads, only 45,000 were electric vehicles in day-to-day use and of those, 90% were milkfloats.[18] Sinclair chose to rely on existing lead–acid battery technology, avoiding the great expense of developing a more efficient type. His rationale was that if the electric vehicle market took off, battery manufacturers would step up to develop better batteries.[19] Wood Rogers recalls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were stuck with the standard technology of the time. A car battery was out of the question because it couldn't stand constant charge/discharge cycles, a traction battery, similar to the kind used in milk floats, could be recharged from flat and a semi-traction battery, often used by caravanners, offered a good compromise. Sadly, though, we had very little freedom of choice.[18]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development programme moved to the University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised at an early stage that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency.[19] By March 1982, the basic design of the C1 had been established.[20] Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over 150 kilograms (330 lb), far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme.[21] Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair that it would not be fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.[18]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet the steadily escalating development costs of the vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling some of his own shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company.[22] Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was never going to happen – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work.[21] In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in Coventry in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.[23]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project's prospects were boosted by changes in the British government's approach to electric vehicles. In March 1980, it had abolished Vehicle Excise Duty for electric vehicles and by the start of 1983, the Department of Transport was working on legislation that would introduce a new category of vehicle – the "electrically assisted pedal cycle". This had a number of significant advantages from Sinclair's point of view. Such a vehicle would be exempt from insurance and vehicle tax, and the user would not need a driving licence or a helmet, all of which were required for mopeds.[21] The legislation, which was passed in August 1983,[20] was prompted by a lobbying campaign by manufacturers such as Raleigh who wanted to sell electric bicycles.[24]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair realised that his electric vehicle design could easily be adapted to meet the new legislation. As the "electrically assisted pedal cycle" category was so new, there were no existing vehicles on the market that would meet the standards prescribed by the new legislation. However, it imposed a number of restrictions that limited the performance of any vehicle that would qualify under the new standards. The maximum legal speed of the vehicle would be limited to only 15 miles per hour (24 km/h); it could not weigh any more than 60 kilograms (130 lb), including the battery; and its motor could not be rated at any more than 250 watts.[25]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the vehicle was seen as only the first step in a series of increasingly ambitious electrical cars. Sinclair intended it to prove the viability of electric personal transport; the hope was that, just as Sinclair had found with home computers like the hugely successful ZX81 and ZX Spectrum, an affordable electric vehicle could unleash pent-up demand for a market that did not previously exist.[25] However, Sinclair performed no market research to ascertain whether there was actually a market for his electric vehicle; as the director of the Primary Contact advertising agency commented in January 1985, the project continued all the way to the prototype stage "purely on the convictions of Sir Clive".[20]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Development and design&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;With Sinclair's new specifications in hand, Ogle worked on a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug – another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering was the brainchild of Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver to get in and out easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that "putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural".[26] A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5.[20] In the autumn of 1983,[20] Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production.[25] The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in Leicestershire.[27]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further aerodynamic refinements were carried out in Exeter with the development of new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance.[28] He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee.[29] It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, "day one of my working life", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a "proper" electric car. He said later that he thought "the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features." Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, "asking what we were doing about visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications ...".[30] It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead.[24] He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently.[28] Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him.[24] He later described his contribution as "convert[ing] an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device".[31]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chassis of the C5 consists of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex.[28] Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, a subsidiary of the Dutch company Philips.[1] Although it was later said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor,[32] the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns.[28] The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off.[9] The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy.[33] Oldham Batteries provided a lead–acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.[28]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodywork was made from two injection-moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J. Harvey of Manchester made the moulds, Linpac provided the shells, and ICI supplied the raw material. According to Rodney Dale, the upper shell mould was "one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world".[28] The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair's ambition for the C5 production line. A single mould set was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The two parts of the shell were joined by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a jig, pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it.[28] The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the Austin Maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete.[26] Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this did not happen, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.[9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the work of assembling the C5 was given to The Hoover Company in the spring of 1983. The Welsh Development Agency (WDA) approached Hoover to ask them if they would be interested becoming the principal subcontractor for Sinclair, "who are working on an electric car, and as a by-product of the research have designed an electrically assisted bicycle. They are looking for a subcontractor to whom they can entrust the assembly."[34] The proposal suited all sides. The WDA was keen to support the Hoover washing machine factory at Merthyr Tydfil, situated in the economically depressed South Wales Valleys. Hoover was enticed by Sinclair's projections of sales of 200,000 units a year, increasing to 500,000. Sinclair saw Hoover's plant and expertise as a good match for their fabrication techniques. A contract was signed within a few months.[34]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Production, distribution and support&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The C5 was produced in great secrecy in a separate part of the Hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities. At first the work was carried out by a small team of people in a sealed room, but as production ramped up Hoover installed two production lines in building MP7, connected to the main factory by a tunnel. A rolling testing stand was located at the end of the production line to test each completed C5 for faults. A mechanical arm simulated the weight of a person weighing 12 stone (170 lb; 76 kg) and the vehicle's brakes were tested under load. At the end of the process the C5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks. Around £100,000 was spent to set up the factory.[33]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distribution centres were set up in Hayes in Middlesex, Preston in Lancashire and Oxford to handle the C5s.[35] Hoover arranged for 19 of its service offices around the UK – responsible for maintaining customers' vacuum cleaners and washing machines – to also maintain C5s and provide spare parts.[36] The C5's major consumable item, the battery, was to be supported by 300 branches of Comet and Woolworths.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoover trained its engineers to produce C5s and tested its manufacturing processes by assembling, dismantling and re-assembling 100 C5s.[35] Full production began in November 1984 and by early January 1985 over 2,500 C5s had been manufactured.[37] Each production line could produce 50 vehicles an hour, and Hoover were capable of producing up to 8,000 C5s per week.[35]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Launch&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The news of Sinclair's C5 project came as a surprise when it became public and attracted considerable interest, as well as scepticism. The Economist reported in June 1983 that carmakers were "startled" but cautious about Sinclair's prospects; as one competitor put it, "If it were anyone but Sinclair, we'd say he was bonkers". The Economist asked, "Can a man who has made a fortune out of calculators and computers, and could double it on flatscreen televisions, be that crazy?" and wondered whether he was "making a ghastly mistake", a prediction that industry insiders thought was likely.[38]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C5 was launched on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with women handing out press packs[35] and a variety of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game.[39] The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by women dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side.[40] Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign.[37] The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.[36]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair issued a glossy sales brochure characterising the vehicle as a part of an ongoing exercise in "cutting giants down to size, turning impersonal tyrants into personal servants". The brochure highlighted Sinclair's achievements in producing affordable pocket calculators, home computers, and pocket televisions and declared, "with the C5, Sinclair Vehicles puts personal, private transport back where it belongs – in the hands of the individual."[5] The photographs accompanying the text showed housewives and teenagers driving the C5 to shops, railway stations, and sports fields – in the words of technology writers Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy, "a blue-sky suburbia exclusively populated by electric trikes and their drivers".[41]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press was given an opportunity to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, "an unqualified disaster".[42] A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered.[42] The Sunday Times called the C5 a "Formula One bath-chair"; its reporter "had travelled five yards outdoors when everything went phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule".[43] The Guardian's reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes,[44] while Your Computer found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: "The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive "peep, peep" noise signalling that the engine had overheated."[45] Even the former racing driver Stirling Moss ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported that while he had started out well, "a jaunty smile on [his] face as he braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath", he ran into problems when he reached a hill: "It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead. On a cold and foggy London day, the great man was visibly sweating."[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing and location of the launch event – in the middle of winter, on the top of a snow- and ice-covered hill – later prompted criticism even from Sinclair executives, who admitted off the record that spring conditions might have been better for a vehicle with so little protection from the British climate.[46] The Financial Times called it "the worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious, road-going vehicle".[47] Sinclair's biographer Rodney Dale describes it as "a calculated (or miscalculated) risk", observing that production was already underway, details were beginning to leak out to the press and "the launch could hardly have been held up until the possibility of a bright spring day". He justified the choice of January as being necessitated by a need to release the C5 "as soon as possible lest the erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good".[39] Rob Gray offers an alternative explanation, that the launch date had been brought forward because Sinclair's development funds were running low.[48]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reviews&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;It soon became apparent that the C5 faced more serious problems with public perception than merely a botched launch event. Media reactions to the C5 were generally negative when the first reviews appeared over the following days. As the Financial Times observed, "the few hardy journalists who ventured out on the roads returned shivering and dubious about the C5's abilities in such harsh conditions."[47]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common concern was that it was simply too vulnerable in traffic. Your Computer commented that "a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level."[45] The Guardian's motoring correspondent wrote of her "grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic ... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic."[2] Another Guardian writer wrote that he "would not want to drive [the] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me."[44] Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.[49]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As teenagers were among the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy's words) "packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s".[42] The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of "kids us[ing] them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down."[50] Sinclair dismissed such concerns – "I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these".[2] Teenagers interviewed by The Guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while it was fun to drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair's claims to have revolutionised the electric vehicle were dismissed by many reviewers; Your Computer called the C5 "more of a toy than the 'ideal solution for all types of local journey' which the brochure claims".[45] The Guardian's motoring correspondent also characterised it as "a delightful toy".[2] The Daily Telegraph described it as "a cleverly-designed 'fun' machine that can hardly be regarded as serious, everyday all-weather transport",[51] while The Engineer viewed it as "a smashing big boy's toy, tough enough to take teenage thrashing and possibly a serious vehicle for fit adults to nip out in for the Sunday papers".[52]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, the C5's handling characteristics were praised by reviewers. The Guardian called it "very easy to master once you have become familiar with the under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle-type pedals."[2] The Daily Mirror described the arrangement as "surprisingly easy" to master, although it cautioned that "on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels."[53] The Daily Express motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 "stable, comfortable and easy to handle".[54]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verdict from motoring organisations, road safety groups, and consumer watchdogs was decidedly negative and probably sealed the C5's fate. The British Safety Council (BSC) tested the C5 at Sinclair Vehicles' headquarters in Warwick and issued a highly critical report to its 32,000 members. Sinclair was furious and announced that he would sue the BSC and its chairman, James Tye, for defamation (although nothing came of it)[55] after Tye told the press: "I am shattered that within a few days 14-year-old children will be allowed to drive on the road in this Doodle Bug without a licence ... without insurance and without any form of training."[56] Several years later, Tye was happy to take responsibility for the C5's failure, describing himself as "the man entirely to blame for the failure of the Sinclair C5".[57]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sales history&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Despite the problems of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday.[58] Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; fewer than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers – were returned with fresh orders.[59] Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.[8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C5's users were an eclectic group. They included holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers;[58] the British Royal Family – Princes William and Harry each had one to drive around Kensington Palace before they were old enough to drive;[60] Sir Elton John, who had two;[61] the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park;[62] Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka;[63] and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5.[64] However, as The Times reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.[8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the C5 reached retail stores at the start of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of teenagers to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told The Times that "we haven't done ... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off."[65] Sinclair was reported to be surprised at the lack of demand and blamed the press for "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting".[65] Matters did not improve; three decades later, the C5's failure was attributed in Wallpaper to there being no market, insofar as "global warming hadn't been invented then".[66] The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.[67]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to Sinclair's problems, production of the C5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that the plastic moulding attached to the gearbox was impairing the performance of their vehicles. 100 Hoover workers were shifted from the C5 production line to work on replacing the faulty mouldings on returned vehicles.[67] Barrie Wills admitted that Sinclair was also taking the opportunity to "adjust stocks" in the light of the C5's poor sales.[68] When production resumed a month later it was at only 10% of the previous level, with 90 of the workers being transferred back to the washing machine production lines. Only 100 C5s were now being produced a week, down from the original 1,000. Over 3,000 unsold C5s were piled up in storage at the Hoover factory, with additional unsold stock in 500 retail outlets nationwide.[69]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair tried to put a brave face on it, admitting that "sales have not been entirely up to expectations" but claiming to be "confident of a high level of demand for the vehicle".[46] A spokesman told the media that "we expect a rapid rise in sales now that the weather is improving".[69] Possible sales opportunities were explored in mainland Europe, Asia, and the United States, with Sinclair claiming that he had found "very big" levels of interest.[70] Hoover were sufficiently persuaded to allow Sinclair to divert 10 of their employees to modify C5s for overseas export.[71] The bid to sell the C5 abroad failed; the Dutch National Transport Service told Sinclair that the C5 was not suitable for Dutch roads without improvements to its braking system, the addition of more reflectors, and the inclusion of the High-Vis Mast as part of the basic package. Most of the other ten countries that Sinclair inquired of demanded similar changes.[67]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C5's reputation received a further battering when major consumer organisations published sceptical evaluations. The Automobile Association questioned many of Sinclair's claims in a report published at the start of May. It found that the range of the vehicle was typically only about 10 miles (16 km) rather than the 20 miles (32 km) promised by Sinclair, and reported that the C5's battery ran flat after only 6.5 miles (10.5 km) on a cold day. The C5's running speed was more usually around 12.5 miles per hour (20.1 km/h) than the claimed 15 miles per hour (24 km/h), while its running costs compared unfavourably to that of a petrol-driven Honda PX50 moped. The stability, general roadworthiness, and especially the safety of the C5 were questioned, and the AA suggested that the High-Vis Mast should be included as part of the standard package.[72] It concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C5 looks more comfortable and convenient than it really is – older cyclists looking for less pedal effort will be disappointed by the agility its layout demands. Although it is delightfully quiet, performance, range, and comfort do not compare with the better mopeds and costs are much closer than one might think when one allows for the inevitable battery replacement.[72]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Consumers' Association published a critical report on the C5 in the June issue of its magazine Which?, concluding that the vehicle was of only limited use and represented poor value for money. All three of the C5s that it tested broke down with a "major gearbox fault" and their High-Vis Masts snapped. The longest run between battery charges was only 14.2 miles (22.9 km), and a more realistic achievable range was 5–10 miles (8–16 km). It also echoed the AA's concerns about the C5's safety and the omission of the High-Vis Mast from the standard package.[73] The magazine also called the C5 "too easy to steal",[74] hardly surprising considering that while a security lock could be used to prevent it being driven away, the C5 was light enough that a would-be thief could simply pick it up and carry it off.[75]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the summer of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 remained far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In the middle of that month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified.[76] Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90[77] but by the end of the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.[71]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production was terminated in August 1985, by which time 14,000 C5s had been assembled.[78] Cashflow problems caused by the paucity of sales caused relations to break down between Sinclair Vehicles and Hoover. In June 1985, Hoover obtained a writ against Sinclair for unpaid debts of over £1.5 million, relating to work carried out over the previous eight months.[79] It did not actually serve the writ but entered negotiations with Sinclair. In mid-August, it publicly announced that it was ceasing production of the C5.[71] A Sinclair spokesman told the media that the halt in production was "due to a shortage of certain components which are unable to be re-ordered while a financial settlement is pending. Once this has been concluded production is envisaged to recommence."[70]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Demise of Sinclair Vehicles&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Production did not recommence and the Hoover production line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles changed its name to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.[80]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 5 November, TPD was formally liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to the anger of the creditors, that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million debenture to cover the money that he had put into the company. Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding.[81] Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000.[81] The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.[78]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many reasons have been suggested for the failure of Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment".[23] One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything."[47] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as "a sophisticated toy": "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?"[78] His strategy was successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.[82]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some commentators attributed the C5's failure to problems with Sinclair's marketing strategy; only a year after the demise of Sinclair Vehicles, the Globe and Mail newspaper called it "one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry".[3] Andrew P. Marks of Paisley College of Technology criticised Sinclair's marketing strategy as confused; the C5 promotional brochure depicts it as a leisure vehicle, showing boys in C5s at a football pitch, women in C5s on a suburban road, and so on, while the text suggests that the C5 is a serious substitute for a car. He concludes that the C5 was poorly defined, appearing to be "trying to grasp at two different markets" but was unable to appeal to either, and so failed to take off. The fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake, in Marks' view, as it meant that no physical inspection of the product could be made before purchasing it. This was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made the C5 a much more risky purchase.[20]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design researcher and academic Nigel Cross calls the C5 a "notorious ... example of failure" and describes its basic concept as "wrong". He said the marketing research for the C5 was carried out after the vehicle's concept had already been decided, observing that it appears to have been intended "mainly to aid promotion" rather than to guide development.[4] Gus Desbarats, the C5's industrial designer, attributes the vehicle's flawed concept to Sinclair operating in a "bubble"[31] and believes that Sinclair "failed to understand the difference between a new market, computing, and a mature one, transport, where there were more benchmarks to compare against".[30] He comments that the experience of working on the C5 convinced him of the need for industrial designers such as himself to get "involved early in the innovation process, shaping basic configurations, never again [being] satisfied to simply decorate a fundamentally bad idea".[31]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair himself said in 2005 that the C5 "was early for what it was. People reacted negatively and the press didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press."[61] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns "could have been addressed if it wasn't for the fact that it was already doomed as a national joke." He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called "just a fun way of getting around".[83] Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future."[83]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Legacy&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sinclair's other electric vehicles&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Sinclair envisaged producing follow-up vehicles such as the C10, a two-seater city car, and the C15, a three-seater capable of travelling at 80 miles per hour (130 km/h).[84] As Wills put it at the launch event, "We're developing a family of traffic-compatible, quiet, economic and pollution-free vehicles for the end of the '80s." The C5 was described as "the baby of the family".[40] The C10 was intended to be a city car, capable of carrying two passengers at up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) in a roofed but open-sided compartment with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Wood Rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of the Isetta, a 1960s Italian microcar. Sinclair built a full-scale mock-up of it; according to Wood Rogers, "it looked great. I specified open sides to keep the cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too." The design is strikingly similar to the modern Renault Twizy electric vehicle; Wood Rogers comments that "you could put the C10 into production today and it would still look contemporary."[27]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the C5's launch, Sinclair described the C15 as having "a futuristic design with an elongated 'tear-drop' shape, a lightweight body made of self-coloured polypropylene and a single, possibly 'roller' type rear wheel".[84] It would have been launched at the 1988 International Motor Show in Birmingham following a development programme costed at £2 million. Unlike the relatively conventional technology used in the C5, Sinclair intended to use sodium sulphur batteries with four times the power-to-weight ratio of lead–acid batteries to give the C15 much greater speed and range – over 180 miles (290 km) on a single charge. It would have had approximately the same dimensions as a conventional small car, measuring 3.5 metres (11 ft) long, 1.35 metres (4 ft 5 in) high, and 1.35 metres (4 ft 5 in) wide.[85] However, it could only have worked if sodium sulphur batteries had realised their promise. In the event they did not, the project could not continue, due to thermal problems.[27] Neither the C10 nor the C15 ever left the drawing board.[84]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Sinclair went on to produce more (but much smaller) electric vehicles (including the Sinclair Zike in 1992) the C5 debacle did lasting damage to the reputation of subsequent EVs in the UK, which the media routinely compared to the C5. It was not until a highly regarded manufacturer, Toyota, launched a serious and well-received vehicle in the 1990s, the Prius, that the C5 "jinx" was finally laid to rest.[86]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Sir Clive's nephew Grant Sinclair presented what he called an updated version of the Sinclair C5 called the Iris eTrike.[87][88][89]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cult following&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Despite its lack of commercial success when it was released, the C5 later gained an unexpected cult following.[61] Collectors began purchasing them as investment items,[90] reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax.[63] According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail price.[91] By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than £5,000 to collectors.[92]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C5 owners began modifying their vehicles to achieve levels of performance far beyond anything envisaged by Sinclair. Adam Harper used one C5 as a stunt vehicle, driving it through a 70 ft (21 m) tunnel of fire,[92] and adapted another to run at 150 miles per hour (240 km/h), aiming to break a world land speed record for a three-wheeled electric vehicle and the British record for any type of electric vehicle.[93][94] He said later: "Up to 100 mph [160 km/h] it's like you're running on rails, it's really stable. Then at about 110 to 120 mph [180–195 km/h] it starts getting tricky. At that point if a tire blew up or something happened you would be surely dead".[94]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As quoted in the 1987 Guinness Book of Records under battery powered vehicle: "John W. Owen and Roy Harvey travelled 919 miles (1479 km) from John O'Groats to Land's End in a Sinclair C5 in 103 hr 15 min on 30 Apr-4 May 1985" (8.9 mph/14.3 km/h average).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Crosskey, an engineer from Abingdon, set a record for the longest journey completed on a C5 on a trip to Glastonbury – 103 miles (166 km) away ("I nearly died of exhaustion")[95] – and tried three times to drive one from Land's End to John o' Groats, a distance of 874 miles (1,407 km).[61] Another engineer, Adrian Bennett, fitted a jet engine to his C5,[96] while plumber and inventor Colin Furze turned one into a 5-foot-high (1.5 m) "monster trike" with 2 feet (0.6 m) wheels and a petrol engine capable of propelling it at 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).[97]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The singer John Otway has used a C5 in his stage show and publicity.[98]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b Adamson, Ian; Kennedy, Richard (1986).

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computation and Language&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 6 Jan 2026]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Extracting books from production language models&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%). Taken together, our work highlights that, even with model- and system-level safeguards, extraction of (in-copyright) training data remains a risk for production LLMs.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.CL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tesla’s Germany Sales Down 72% From Their Peak!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After writing about Tesla’s 10% drop in sales in the UK despite the UK EV market rising 24%, and BYD passing up Tesla in the UK in annual sales last year, a reader pointed out some extra jaw-dropping stats. The reader, “manes,” posted the numbers for Tesla in Germany in the past 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you get nauseous looking at gory scenes, turn away now. Here’s what “manes” shared:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Numbers from Germany:&lt;lb/&gt; * 2025: 19,390&lt;lb/&gt; * 2024: 37,574&lt;lb/&gt; * 2023: 63,685&lt;lb/&gt; * 2022: 69,965&lt;lb/&gt; * 2021: 39,714&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So Tesla fell to 28% of its peak in ’22.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wowza! Tesla sales in Germany, the largest auto market in Europe, dropped 72% in 2025 compared to Tesla’s best year in that country, way back in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit/update: Also note that the BEV market grew by 43% in 2025!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 2022, Tesla had a modest but clear drop in sales in 2023, and then they had a huge collapse in sales in 2024 — which Tesla was supposed to bounce back from last year thanks to the refreshed Model Y coming to town — but that wasn’t the end! Sales dropped even significantly further in 2025, dropping almost 50%!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going from 69,965 sales in the company’s peak year to 63,685 sales the following year, then a shocking 37,75 sales, and then to 19,390?! The year Tesla opened Giga Berlin, it looked like it was only upward for Tesla in Europe. And then it crashed hard, year after year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, a big factor for Tesla’s sales drop in Germany was Elon Musk getting involved in hardcore right-wing politics. Musk strongly endorsed the AfD (Alternative for Germany) political party in recent years, a political party identified as an extremist, far-right party. “In the 2024 Thuringian state election, the AfD became the first far-right party in Germany since the Nazi Party to win a plurality of seats in a state election. The AfD also performed strongly in Brandenburg and Saxony,” Wikipedia writes. “On 23 February 2025 AfD won 20.8% of the vote in the German federal election, second to the CDU/CSU. It gained 10.4 percentage points over the 2021 election result.” So, yes, the party got more popular in the past couple of years, but that doesn’t mean it is popular. The large majority of Germans do not support it, and many are shocked and disgusted by its political stances. Throwing his support behind AfD, Musk stimulated huge anti-Tesla sentiment in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Musk also made some abhorrent comments regarding Nazis and Hitler that went even a step further. We have a German on our leadership team who has been saying for a while that the Tesla brand is completely in the ditch, hated, and hopeless in Germany now. Despite having a factory there and the brand being very popular a few years ago, his take is that no one wants a Tesla any more, and that the cars aren’t even the best in tech any more. I wasn’t sure how much his comments reflected the whole market, but dropping from 69,965 annual sales to 19,390 annual sales in three years is a dramatic drop that is almost unheard of in the auto industry. It takes a lot of work to drop that far that fast. Also, beyond the brand hit from Elon Musk’s activities, it is true that German automakers BMW, Mercedes, and Volkswagen, among others, have been rolling out new EV after new EV, and Tesla has lost its competitive edge in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big question is: what will Tesla’s numbers be in Germany, and in Europe more broadly, in 2026 and beyond? What is in store now for the company that once dominated the EV market?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now, we’ve all heard the familiar refrain: “It’s for your safety.” It’s the soothing mantra of every government official who’s ever wanted a peek behind your digital curtains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week, with a move that would make East Germany blush, the UK government officially confirmed its intention to hand Ofcom (yes, that Ofcom, the regulator that once investigated whether Love Island was too spicy) the keys to your private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The country, already experiencing rapidly declining civil liberties, is now planning to scan encrypted chats for “bad stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, for those unfamiliar, Ofcom is the UK’s communications regulator that has recently been given censorship pressure powers for online speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s become the government’s Swiss Army knife for everything from internet censorship to now, apparently, full-blown surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the Online Safety Act, Ofcom has been handed something called Section 121, which sounds like a tax loophole but is actually a legal crowbar for prying open encrypted messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It allows the regulator to compel any online service that lets people talk to each other, Facebook Messenger, Signal, iMessage, etc to install “accredited technology” to scan for terrorism or child abuse material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More: Starmer Adds To UK Civil Liberties Decline With Reckless iCloud Backdoor Demand&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way this works is by scanning all your messages. Not just the suspicious ones. Not just the flagged ones. Every single message. On your device. Before they’re encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is “client-side scanning,” which is a clever euphemism for “we’re turning your phone into a government informant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear about what’s at stake. End-to-end encryption is what keeps your private messages private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the UK’s plan effectively makes that encryption irrelevant. If the message gets scanned before it’s encrypted, the whole thing is about as useful as putting a padlock on a door that’s already wide open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t some consequence. This is the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lord Hanson of Flint, the man chosen to deliver this particularly Orwellian update in the House of Lords, confirmed that Ofcom is expected to start using these powers just as soon as it finishes its report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have set a date of April 2026,” he said, presumably while polishing his best ‘nothing to see here’ smile, “and we expect to act extremely speedily once we have had the report back.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baroness Butler-Sloss, clearly tired of waiting for this dystopia to arrive on schedule, pushed for Ofcom to get on with it. “Work to do this now,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Baroness Berger popped up to promote something called “upload prevention technology.” It sounds like an antivirus program crossed with a puritanical school principal, and she claimed it can stop harmful content before it spreads. Lovely idea. Also, exactly how Chinese censorship works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She also accused tech companies of lying when they say scanning encrypted messages isn’t possible. And maybe they are. But when your answer to that is “Well, we’ll just force them to comply by law,” you’re not solving the problem. You’re building a digital panopticon with the grace of a sledgehammer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem. Once you install the infrastructure to scan for one kind of content, however vile, it’s there forever. And that tool, like every government tool, will be “repurposed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It starts with child abuse material, because who’s going to defend not catching that? Then maybe a few terrorist memes. Then maybe “hate speech.” Then “misinformation.” Then a joke about the&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister’s haircut. And suddenly, you’re far from a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re just renting space in an open-air digital prison where your every word is silently filed away in a database next to your Amazon shopping history and that one embarrassing search from 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been yelling about this for years. You cannot build a scanning system that only finds “the bad stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government is playing the long game. Ofcom will issue its report by April 2026, followed by a “consultation,” which, let’s be honest, only ever goes one way, and then the Home Office will act “extremely speedily,” whatever that means in bureaucratic time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s certain is this: if they get their way, private messaging in the UK will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
