  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Cold-blooded software&lt;/head&gt;December 28, 2023&lt;p&gt;Itâs 2004 and Iâm sitting in one of the largest lecture halls at my university. Iâm a computer science major but Iâm taking a course on natural history â plants and animals â as one of my electives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professor tells us that heâs brought something from home, something he found in his freezer. He reaches down behind his desk, and then holds his arm out to show us whatâs sitting in his palm: a baby painted turtle. Weâre learning about cold-blooded animals, and it turns out that painted turtle hatchlings are pretty special â theyâre one of only a few species that can survive being frozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the lecture hall is pretty modern for 2004: there’s an overhead camera at the podium, where the professor can write notes that are displayed on screens around the hall. But instead of writing notes, he puts the turtle under the camera and starts his lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next hour, we watch this little reptile slowly come to life as the professor lectures. The first movements were nearly imperceptible. An eyelid cracking open, a leg inching forward. By the end of the lecture, the turtle has moved about halfway across our screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iâll never forget that class, because itâs where I really understood what it means for an animal to be cold blooded. You see, warm-blooded animals â like humans or mice â have a stable body temperature that stays within a pretty narrow range. For humans, itâs around 37 degrees Celsius. A few degrees higher or lower and weâre in big trouble. Cold-blooded animals like the painted turtle can adapt their metabolism to the temperature around them. Theyâre active when itâs warm out, and as the environment (and their bodies) get cooler, they move more slowly. Very few of them can survive being frozen like the baby painted turtle can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see a similar dichotomy with software projects. Certain technology decisions lead to projects that are warm-blooded: everything is great when there’s constant motion on the project, generating heat. But put warm-blooded software in the freezer, and you’ll pull out a corpse six months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe your CI isn’t working because one of the services you depend on got bought or ran out of money. You add a new dependency and find yourself needing to upgrade your compiler. Another package you depend on is deprecated, and doesn’t work with the latest version of the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some projects are different. You work alone, make some changes when youâre inspired, and then donât touch it again for another year, or two, or three. You canât run something like that as a warm-blooded project. Thereâs not enough activity to keep the temperature up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cold-blooded project is like the baby painted turtle. You can freeze it for a year and then pick it back up right where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cold-blooded project uses boring technology. The build and test scripts donât depend on external services that might change, break, or disappear entirely. It uses vendored dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software that powers this blog is cold-blooded. The first commit was nearly twelve years ago â a simple little static site generator to replace my out-of-date Wordpress installation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;commit 68949229ad426c1e8795ee640808db9987ab30ab

    Add templates and site-building script.&lt;/code&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Itâs written in Python (2, not 3). It depends on four third-party modules, and theyâre all committed to the project repository. Everything runs locally, and I deploy the result with rsync over ssh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And boy am I glad I decided to do it that way. Iâve made a few small improvements over the years, but otherwise itâs continued to work without modification. And I fully expect that it will still be working in another twelve years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ð¢&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ð You might also want to check out the discussion on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Thorsten Ball for helpful suggestions on this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series about Street Fighter II and the CPS-1. It is recommended to read the previous entries before reading this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite anecdote about Street Fighter II is Akiman's account of an issue discovered shortly before shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Just three days before the deadline, I discovered something horrible. I had made a mistake with the subtitle “World Warrior”, mis-spelling it “World Warrier.”A recreation of the problem. Ouch!&lt;lb/&gt;- Akiman, Lead graphic design on SF2 (translated by Shmuplation)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fully understand the issue, we need to dig into how the arcade hardware works. The CPS-1 is a super tile drawing machine. It can draw a lot of tiles but cannot alter them. They are taken from the GFX ROM as they are and sent to the screen (although they can be flipped horizontally or vertically).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GFX ROM and the 68000 instructions ROM as burned separately. The problem Akiman describe is that the GFX ROM had been burned but he could still make changes to the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how could he fix the mistake if the artwork was set in stone at this point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Now I can safely tell this story too, but we actually didn’t discover it until several months after all the sprite work had been done. Since the logo had already been created, I couldn’t just go in and change the letter at this point.&lt;lb/&gt;"Maybe I can just force it to look like an ‘o’," I thought. I tried layering various other sprites over it until finally, it looked like an ‘o’. Phew!&lt;lb/&gt;- Akiman, Lead graphic design on SF2 (translated by Shmuplation)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Akiman description of the solution left me wanting more details. How did he turn an 'e' into an 'o'? Since I had a sheet extractor, I looked for the text and sure enough, the logo and the typo were found on sheet &lt;code&gt;0x7B00&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The logo is drawn via 16 draw calls using tiles &lt;code&gt;0xC8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xC9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xCA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xCB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xCC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xCD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xCE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xCF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xD8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xD9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xDA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xDB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xDC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xDD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xDE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;0xDF&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The way Akiman solved his problem show that you have to be practical in order to ship. He noticed that there was an 'or' in 'World' which would kinda fit in place of the 'ier'. So, he dropped the three last tiles &lt;code&gt;0xDD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xDE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;0xDF&lt;/code&gt; and replaced them with &lt;code&gt;0xCD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0xCE&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was better but it only displaced the problem since the borrowed right leg of the 'W' looked like an 'l' instead of an 'i'. The logo now read 'The World Warrlor'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, what was needed was a way to slice the top of the 'l' to make it look like a dot on top of an 'i' but how could he do that since the 68000 cannot write in a tile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last part of the puzzle comes from Guile's calves. If you look closely at tile &lt;code&gt;0x96&lt;/code&gt; you will notice that it has only one pixel visible in the lower left corner.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="17"/&gt;&lt;row span="17"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Guile palette&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="17"/&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;World Warrier palette&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something that I omitted to mention earlier is that the palette management is entirely under the 68000 control. The CPU is free to issue a tile drawing command using whatever palette it pleases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guile's green palette is not useful since the logo uses blue colors. But if we place them side by side, we notice that index &lt;code&gt;14&lt;/code&gt; is dark green in Guile's palette but dark blue in the logo palette. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using tile &lt;code&gt;0x96&lt;/code&gt; with the logo palette allows the 68000 to have a (very expensive) system where 255 pixels are wasted to transparency but the 256th can be used like a pencil.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pencil-tile is used to issue three draw command with coordinates overlapping the 'l'. This effectively creates a line which cuts the top part and make it look like the dot at the top of an 'i'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ever wondered why the 'i' of 'Warrior' looked weird all these years, now you know.&lt;/p&gt;Et voila!&lt;p&gt;The typo was fixed in later versions of Street Fighter 2 where the "World Warrior" set of tiles features a proper "IOR".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically these are not used since the sub-title was changed from "World Warrior" to "Champion Edition" and then "Hyper-fighting".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s contradictory to sit alone in a café. It’s against the reason cafés exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are designed as meeting spaces. There is no table with a single chair. Even the ones placed right by the window with high seating are big tables with many chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cafés are community spaces. Most go there to see their loved ones, friends, or colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You find only a few people sitting alone. Most are buried in their laptops, working hard to make a living in their own worlds, whatever world they have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I rarely do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I took time off from work, I chose a staycation. Unlike most of my friends, who visited Japan in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I heard their experiences, I was jealous. When I told them my staycation plans of doing nothing for four weeks, they were jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While off work, I wanted to slow time down as much as I could. The best way to freeze time, I read somewhere, is to get a dog. Luckily, I have one already. So, I took long walks with my dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What used to feel like 10 minutes between breakfast and lunch while working became a full-blown day. Even though I was spending two hours walking my dog instead of a 30-40 minute rush, it felt like an eternity. A peaceful eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the second day, I decided to leave my phone at home, so I lived those two hours to the fullest. I didn’t take any device that could connect me to the internet or to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all the anxiety evaporated after 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt free, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t that nobody could reach out to me that felt like an escape; it was that I couldn’t reach out to anyone or anything that caused the turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no possibility to text anyone. No possibility to watch or read. No chance to look up anything to fulfill my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mind was alone after a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were a few moments I put my hand into my pocket to take out my phone to look up something I was curious about. My phone wasn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I smiled. Every. Single. Time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On the second day, I randomly walked into a neighborhood café. I ordered an americano with a double shot of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sipping a hot americano feels different when you are in a rush to catch a subway. Its purpose is to wake you up. A sip from that little hole in a single-use cap burns my tongue every time. I despise that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a porcelain cup, you don’t have that. Coffee changes its purpose. It becomes a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sat down with a proper cup of americano. My dog crawled under the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was sitting alone in a café with a dog that had crawled under the table without any electronics that could distract me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distract me from, basically, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was pure delight. Every element. Or rather, the non-existence of any element. No phone. No headphones. No tablet. No laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mind was just drifting with the chatter in the café. I left myself to the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you let your thoughts wander, they take you on a journey you’ll never think possible. You reflect on the smallest details of your fast life. Your brain absorbs all the mistakes you’ve made. You accept that you can’t change failures anymore, as much as you feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might as well not worry about them and focus on what you can change: what you do now. And what you will do next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The next day, I left my phone at home again and decided to stop by the same café. I was lucky; I sat down at the same table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting alone in a café without distractions reveals a lot about people. The same people you pass by in a split second while rushing from home to work, from a meeting to a meeting. The invisible suddenly appears right in front of you. People don’t go away in two seconds. They stay. They sip a coffee. They talk with others, laugh, cry, and worry. Oh, worry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worry is only visible in people’s eyes. Eyes are the channel of the heart. You have to close your ears and look at people’s eyes to see their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You realize that looking into eyes is frightening—both for you and the other person. You try to avoid it, but eventually make eye contact because nobody is physically moving anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As none of you are passing by in a second, you mimic looking at something else. They continue their conversation. But you saw their worry, and you can’t help but try to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You leave the café to avoid making things awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I went there the next day. This time, my table was occupied. I don’t know when it became my table. But it felt like that. I found another one. It was closer to the staff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting alone in a café without distractions shows you how a café works. You never contemplate how they operate behind that giant coffee machine while you’re waiting for your coffee before you run to catch the next bus, tram, subway, or taxi. You never ruminate when you sip from a single-use cup and burn your tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You notice how the staff circulates porcelain cups, from dirty to clean, to the top of the coffee machine. You observe the staff’s reactions to each customer. You try to analyze if someone is a regular by noticing how the staff talks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You wonder whether they consider you a regular, since you’ve been there for the last couple of days. Or they call you a creepy guy with a dog. You will never know. You’re not fine with never knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You promise yourself to come the next day to observe how the staff talks to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I again went to the same café. Unlucky me. A different staff were working on that day. Yet I ordered the same: a cup of americano with a double shot of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting alone in a café without distractions, with a dog that had crawled under the table, brings a light to a truth: you can’t control or influence other people’s thoughts and feelings, no matter what you do. Staff may think of you as a weirdo with a dog; your friends might want to be in your place; your family might be nervous because they can’t reach out to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know you can’t change any of those unless you change who you are. It makes you feel alone and powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are alone and powerless. You encounter a deep challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The next day, I didn’t go to the café. I instead took an even longer walk. I went there the following day, knowing I had faced that challenge in my longest walk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting alone in a café without distractions shows everyone you’re alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an alone act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A scary but powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many avoid at all costs. That’s why everybody looks at you with wondering eyes. They are afraid of your powerful joy. They can’t grasp why someone would do this to themselves. They are hesitant but are thinking of doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you realize you’re planting thoughts in people’s minds that you can’t control. Feelings are feelings. Thoughts are thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just at the moment you think you are alone again, you see another weirdo across the café sitting alone without distractions. That weirdo is looking at your sleeping-in-a-croissant-shape dog under the table. Weirdo is enjoying the moment, while your dog is on an adventure in her second dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You smile. You know you’re not alone. You are one weirdo sitting at a distance from one other. You know there are many.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe one of them is reading this and feeling heard. Perhaps one will never see this and will always feel alone. But it only needs one look around. You glance over the café and leave with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The next day, I went there again. This time, I put in an intentional distraction. A good one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting alone in a café without distractions only gets better when there is something to write on. Not with a keyboard. You must use your single hand to write, not two. Ideally, with a pen on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pen is meant to slow you down. The words shouldn’t land on paper at the speed of thinking or even talking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The writing must hurt your wrist or hand. It must turn into a burden. That pain is a signal telling you that you have written long enough. Maybe you wrote only five lines. Perhaps one thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember when PHP 4 was a thing. jQuery was new and shiny. Sites were built with tables, not divs. Dreamweaver felt like a life hack. Designs were sliced in Photoshop. Databases lived in phpMyAdmin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It probably didn’t feel like it at the time, but looking back, those were simpler days. The entire concept of the development cycle could fit in my head. There was complexity in building web applications, but it was all manageable. If you had an idea, you could probably build it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a solo developer, you could manage everything. From idea to execution. Or at least, it felt that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m probably romanticizing the past, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Complexity outgrew my ability to follow#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, it’s hard to do web development right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the frontend, you have build pipelines, bundlers, CSS frameworks with their own toolchains, progressive web apps, Core Web Vitals, SEO, layout shifts, srcset/responsive images… I remember when the biggest challenge was IE6 compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the backend, there are design patterns, unit tests, code coverage, APIs, performance concerns, dependency management, infrastructure, monitoring, log tracing, observability…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each area of expertise has grown up - probably for the better - but it also demands deeper domain knowledge. I chose to specialize in backend and server infrastructure. I had to step back from frontend work because I couldn’t keep up with its tooling while developing my backend skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a solo developer, it’s now a lot harder to manage everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Leveling the playing field#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AI has entered the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re far from perfect, but &lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;codex&lt;/code&gt; gave me the leverage I desperately needed. They’ve brought me back to levels of productivity I haven’t felt in years. I feel like I can manage the entire stack again - with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can go from idea to execution in days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the complexity of each domain matters a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pattern recognition#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Oh no, you’re vibe coding - bet it’s all slop and code noise!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, I’ve worked with a lot of talented people: backend developers, frontend developers, marketers, leaders, and more. I can lean on those experiences, fall back on how they did things, and implement their methods with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can reliably reproduce their coding standards, tone of voice, tactics, and processes. Starting a new project once felt insurmountable. Now, it feels realistic again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When AI generates code, I know when it’s good and when it’s not. I’ve seen the good and the bad, and I can iterate from there. Even with refinement and back-and-forth prompting, I’m easily 10x more productive with AI than without it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal hasn’t changed: build quality software that meets modern standards. The goalpost is still far out. But now I have a rocket-powered soccer ball - and I can finally reach it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Room for creativity#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s mental space for creativity in building software again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My head isn’t constantly full of build pipelines, testability concerns, code patterns, unfixed bugs… I’m confident I can cover that with help from AI. It still needs to be done, but it’s done so much faster - and it no longer feels overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That leaves room to experiment with UI and UX, to try ideas and throw them away. To add small quality-of-life improvements I couldn’t justify before, because there was always something more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also not the typing of code that I really enjoy, nor is it the syntax or structure or boilerplate that’s required to build anything. It’s the fact you get to build something out of nothing, writing code was just how you got there. And with today’s tooling, that saves a ton of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI really has made web development fun again.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How Browsers Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interactive guide to how browsers work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The guide is for engineers and curious people who use the web every day, but never built a mental model of how browsers work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find most guides too technical, too detailed, or too shallow, so I have decided to take a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built the guide with many tiny interactive examples you can play with to help you go get through the technical details and build an intuition of how browsers work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep it short and straight to the point, many critical details are omitted like different versions of the HTTP protocol, SSL, TLS, nuances of the DNS, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made the guide open source. Feel free to suggest improvements by creating an issue or a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Browsers work with URLs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can type literally anything in the address bar. But under the hood, browsers work with URLs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A random text like pizza will be transformed into a "search" URL like https://google.com/search?q=pizza (or https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pizza depending on your preferences).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A domain name like example.com will be normalized as a full URL: https://example.com&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see how this works in practice, type something in the address bar and press Enter (or click the "Go" button):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Turning a URL into an HTTP request&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we know the exact URL we want to visit, we can send a request to the server to fetch the resource and display it in the browser. Browsers communicate with servers using the HTTP protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see how a URL is translated into an HTTP request format, enter a full URL like https://example.com and press Enter (or click the "Go" button):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTTP requests have headers in the format like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Host: example.com
Accept: text/html
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the headers is the host header. It is used to identify the server to which the request is sent: example.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Resolving the server address&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browsers can't send requests to names like example.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computers talk to IP addresses, so the browser first asks the DNS system to resolve the domain name into an IP address before it can connect to the server and send the HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type a domain name in the input and press Enter to resolve it into an IP address:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Establishing the TCP connection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After DNS gives the browser an IP address, it still needs a reliable connection to the server. TCP is the protocol that sets up this connection before any HTTP data is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TCP establishes the connection using a three-step handshake that confirms both sides are ready to send and receive data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers are how the client and the server keep track of the conversation. They count bytes, so both sides agree on where the data stream starts and what should come next. If some data doesn't arrive, the sender can see the gap and retransmit the missing bytes. This is how TCP keeps data ordered and reliable once the connection is established.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start sending packets and try to disrupt the network to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;HTTP requests and responses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the TCP connection is established, the browser can send an HTTP request to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click the "Go" button to watch the HTTP request travel to the server and the HTTP response return to the browser:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the HTTP response arrives, the browser reads the raw HTTP response and starts rendering the HTML content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parsing HTML to build the DOM tree&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the HTTP response arrives, the browser separates the headers from the body and feeds the HTML bytes into the parser. The parser turns tags like &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; into tokens and builds a DOM tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click the "Parse" button to watch the HTML stream being parsed into the DOM tree:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Example Domain&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;h1 style="color: red;"&amp;gt;Example Domain&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An example paragraph.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
             &amp;lt;a href="https://example.com"&amp;gt;An example link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Document|- &amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;`- html   |- head   |  `- title   |     `- "Example Domain"   `- body      `- main         |- h1 (style: color: red)         |  `- "Example Domain"         |- p         |  `- "An example paragraph."         `- p            `- a (href="https://example.com")               `- "An example link"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parsing is streaming and error-tolerant: the browser starts building nodes before the full document is downloaded, and it inserts missing tags to keep the tree valid. When a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag appears, parsing may pause so the script can run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOM tree then combines with CSS to produce the render tree that layout and paint use to draw pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On the importance of the DOM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOM is the browser's in-memory model of the document. It is the shared contract between the HTML parser, CSS selector engine, and JavaScript runtime, so changes to it immediately affect layout, styling, and what users can interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOM powers everything from query selection to dynamic styling and event handling. Try editing the script and watch how the DOM changes on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Layout, Paint, and Composite&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the DOM and CSS are ready, the browser runs the rendering pipeline: Layout (reflow) to calculate sizes and positions,Paint to fill pixels, then Composite to stitch layers together on the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every change reruns every stage. Changing colors usually repaints, while changing sizes forces layout and paint to recompute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why layout-heavy pages feel slower: more work needs to happen before the next frame can be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is it! If you completed all the examples, you should have a clear mental model of how browsers work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading the guide, I hope you enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Music and smells are two of the most effective ways to re-experience the emotions of a specific time in the past. Listening to a song from a particular time of my life brings me back to how I felt at that point in ways photos can’t. Sometimes I can even recall exact visuals of what I was doing or where I was walking when listening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, I followed a system that allows me to re-experience any specific time of any year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every January 1st, from desktop/web, I:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new playlist. Title it the past year.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy all of my liked songs and paste them into the new playlist. This will maintain the order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Empty my liked songs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Save an out-of-bounds backup of the new playlist, in case my Spotify account messes up in the future. I select all &amp;amp; paste it into a sheet in Google Drive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start listening to new music, like them over the year.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the archive saves the order of likes, it grants more granular access than just years. For example, if I want to re-experience how the fall of 2016 felt, I open the corresponding year’s list, scroll 1/4 down from the top, and start listening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the year, when I listen to my liked songs, I usually start from the top of the stack, without shuffle. This is natural for me, since the newly saved songs are the ones I like the most at a given time. This causes me to listen to a “rolling window” of my liked songs as time passes, linking specific music to specific dates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to saving songs that I find myself and particularly like, I like to save songs that are playing around me, on the radio, or at places I visit, and somehow stand out. Even if I might not fully like them at first, I find that they serve as great anchor points, and they usually grow on me after a few listens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To maintain the integrity &amp;amp; not override the memories associated with specific songs, I rarely listen to or re-save songs from the past years. Sometimes I give myself exceptions, though, especially with remixes. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;21 Lessons From 14 Years at Google&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;January 3, 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I joined Google ~14 years ago, I thought the job was about writing great code. I was partly right. But the longer I’ve stayed, the more I’ve realized that the engineers who thrive aren’t necessarily the best programmers - they’re the ones who’ve figured out how to navigate everything around the code: the people, the politics, the alignment, the ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These lessons are what I wish I’d known earlier. Some would have saved me months of frustration. Others took years to fully understand. None of them are about specific technologies - those change too fast to matter. They’re about the patterns that keep showing up, project after project, team after team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sharing them because I’ve benefited enormously from engineers who did the same for me. Consider this my attempt to pay it forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. The best engineers are obsessed with solving user problems.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s seductive to fall in love with a technology and go looking for places to apply it. I’ve done it. Everyone has. But the engineers who create the most value work backwards: they become obsessed with understanding user problems deeply, and let solutions emerge from that understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;User obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock. The engineer who truly understands the problem often finds that the elegant solution is simpler than anyone expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineer who starts with a solution tends to build complexity in search of a justification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Being right is cheap. Getting to right together is the real work.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can win every technical argument and lose the project. I’ve watched brilliant engineers accrue silent resentment by always being the smartest person in the room. The cost shows up later as “mysterious execution issues” and “strange resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The skill isn’t being right. It’s entering discussions to align on the problem, creating space for others, and remaining skeptical of your own certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong opinions, weakly held - not because you lack conviction, but because decisions made under uncertainty shouldn’t be welded to identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Bias towards action. Ship. You can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank one.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quest for perfection is paralyzing. I’ve watched engineers spend weeks debating the ideal architecture for something they’ve never built. The perfect solution rarely emerges from thought alone - it emerges from contact with reality. AI can in many ways help here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First do it, then do it right, then do it better. Get the ugly prototype in front of users. Write the messy first draft of the design doc. Ship the MVP that embarrasses you slightly. You’ll learn more from one week of real feedback than a month of theoretical debate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Momentum creates clarity. Analysis paralysis creates nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Clarity is seniority. Cleverness is overhead.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The instinct to write clever code is almost universal among engineers. It feels like proof of competence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But software engineering is what happens when you add time and other programmers. In that environment, clarity isn’t a style preference - it’s operational risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your code is a strategy memo to strangers who will maintain it at 2am during an outage. Optimize for their comprehension, not your elegance. The senior engineers I respect most have learned to trade cleverness for clarity, every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Novelty is a loan you repay in outages, hiring, and cognitive overhead.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treat your technology choices like an organization with a small “innovation token” budget. Spend one each time you adopt something materially non-standard. You can’t afford many.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The punchline isn’t “never innovate.” It’s “innovate only where you’re uniquely paid to innovate.” Everything else should default to boring, because boring has known failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “best tool for the job” is often the “least-worst tool across many jobs”-because operating a zoo becomes the real tax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6. Your code doesn’t advocate for you. People do.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I believed great work would speak for itself. I was wrong. Code sits silently in a repository. Your manager mentions you in a meeting, or they don’t. A peer recommends you for a project, or someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In large organizations, decisions get made in meetings you’re not invited to, using summaries you didn’t write, by people who have five minutes and twelve priorities. If no one can articulate your impact when you’re not in the room, your impact is effectively optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t strictly about self-promotion. It’s about making the value chain legible to everyone- including yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;7. The best code is the code you never had to write.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We celebrate creation in engineering culture. Nobody gets promoted for deleting code, even though deletion often improves a system more than addition. Every line of code you don’t write is a line you never have to debug, maintain, or explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you build, exhaust the question: “What would happen if we just… didn’t?” Sometimes the answer is “nothing bad,” and that’s your solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t that engineers can’t write code or use AI to do so. It’s that we’re so good at writing it that we forget to ask whether we should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8. At scale, even your bugs have users.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With enough users, every observable behavior becomes a dependency - regardless of what you promised. Someone is scraping your API, automating your quirks, caching your bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates a career-level insight: you can’t treat compatibility work as “maintenance” and new features as “real work.” Compatibility is product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design your deprecations as migrations with time, tooling, and empathy. Most “API design” is actually “API retirement.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;9. Most “slow” teams are actually misaligned teams.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a project drags, the instinct is to blame execution: people aren’t working hard enough, the technology is wrong, there aren’t enough engineers. Usually none of that is the real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In large companies, teams are your unit of concurrency, but coordination costs grow geometrically as teams multiply. Most slowness is actually alignment failure - people building the wrong things, or the right things in incompatible ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior engineers spend more time clarifying direction, interfaces, and priorities than “writing code faster” because that’s where the actual bottleneck lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;10. Focus on what you can control. Ignore what you can’t.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a large company, countless variables are outside your control - organizational changes, management decisions, market shifts, product pivots. Dwelling on these creates anxiety without agency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineers who stay sane and effective zero in on their sphere of influence. You can’t control whether a reorg happens. You can control the quality of your work, how you respond, and what you learn. When faced with uncertainty, break problems into pieces and identify the specific actions available to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t passive acceptance but it is strategic focus. Energy spent on what you can’t change is energy stolen from what you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;11. Abstractions don’t remove complexity. They move it to the day you’re on call.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every abstraction is a bet that you won’t need to understand what’s underneath. Sometimes you win that bet. But something always leaks, and when it does, you need to know what you’re standing on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior engineers keep learning “lower level” things even as stacks get higher. Not out of nostalgia, but out of respect for the moment when the abstraction fails and you’re alone with the system at 3am. Use your stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But keep a working model of its underlying failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;12. Writing forces clarity. The fastest way to learn something better is to try teaching it.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing forces clarity. When I explain a concept to others - in a doc, a talk, a code review comment, even just chatting with AI - I discover the gaps in my own understanding. The act of making something legible to someone else makes it more legible to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that you’re going to learn how to be a surgeon by teaching it, but the premise still holds largely true in the software engineering domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about being generous with knowledge. It’s a selfish learning hack. If you think you understand something, try to explain it simply. The places where you stumble are the places where your understanding is shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teaching is debugging your own mental models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;13. The work that makes other work possible is priceless - and invisible.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glue work - documentation, onboarding, cross-team coordination, process improvement - is vital. But if you do it unconsciously, it can stall your technical trajectory and burn you out. The trap is doing it as “helpfulness” rather than treating it as deliberate, bounded, visible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Timebox it. Rotate it. Turn it into artifacts: docs, templates, automation. And make it legible as impact, not as personality trait.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Priceless and invisible is a dangerous combination for your career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;14. If you win every debate, you’re probably accumulating silent resistance.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned to be suspicious of my own certainty. When I “win” too easily, something is usually wrong. People stop fighting you not because you’ve convinced them, but because they’ve given up trying - and they’ll express that disagreement in execution, not meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real alignment takes longer. You have to actually understand other perspectives, incorporate feedback, and sometimes change your mind publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short-term feeling of being right is worth much less than the long-term reality of building things with willing collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;15. When a measure becomes a target, it stops measuring.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every metric you expose to management will eventually be gamed. Not through malice, but because humans optimize for what’s measured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you track lines of code, you’ll get more lines. If you track velocity, you’ll get inflated estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The senior move: respond to every metric request with a pair. One for speed. One for quality or risk. Then insist on interpreting trends, not worshiping thresholds. The goal is insight, not surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16. Admitting what you don’t know creates more safety than pretending you do.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior engineers who say “I don’t know” aren’t showing weakness - they’re creating permission. When a leader admits uncertainty, it signals that the room is safe for others to do the same. The alternative is a culture where everyone pretends to understand and problems stay hidden until they explode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen teams where the most senior person never admitted confusion, and I’ve seen the damage. Questions don’t get asked. Assumptions don’t get challenged. Junior engineers stay silent because they assume everyone else gets it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model curiosity, and you get a team that actually learns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;17. Your network outlasts every job you’ll ever have.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in my career, I focused on the work and neglected networking. In hindsight, this was a mistake. Colleagues who invested in relationships - inside and outside the company - reaped benefits for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They heard about opportunities first, could build bridges faster, got recommended for roles, and co-founded ventures with people they’d built trust with over years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your job isn’t forever, but your network is. Approach it with curiosity and generosity, not transactional hustle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the time comes to move on, it’s often relationships that open the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;18. Most performance wins come from removing work, not adding cleverness.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When systems get slow, the instinct is to add: caching layers, parallel processing, smarter algorithms. Sometimes that’s right. But I’ve seen more performance wins from asking “what are we computing that we don’t need?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deleting unnecessary work is almost always more impactful than doing necessary work faster. The fastest code is code that never runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you optimize, question whether the work should exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;19. Process exists to reduce uncertainty, not to create paper trails.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best process makes coordination easier and failures cheaper. The worst process is bureaucratic theater - it exists not to help but to assign blame when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can’t explain how a process reduces risk or increases clarity, it’s probably just overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if people are spending more time documenting their work than doing it, something has gone deeply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;20. Eventually, time becomes worth more than money. Act accordingly.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in your career, you trade time for money - and that’s fine. But at some point, the calculus inverts. You start to realize that time is the non-renewable resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve watched senior engineers burn out chasing the next promo level, optimizing for a few more percentage points of compensation. Some of them got it. Most of them wondered, afterward, if it was worth what they gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer isn’t “don’t work hard.” It’s “know what you’re trading, and make the trade deliberately.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;21. There are no shortcuts, but there is compounding.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expertise comes from deliberate practice - pushing slightly beyond your current skill, reflecting, repeating. For years. There’s no condensed version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s the hopeful part: learning compounds when it creates new options, not just new trivia. Write - not for engagement, but for clarity. Build reusable primitives. Collect scar tissue into playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineer who treats their career as compound interest, not lottery tickets, tends to end up much further ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A final thought&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one lessons sounds like a lot, but they really come down to a few core ideas: stay curious, stay humble, and remember that the work is always about people - the users you’re building for and the teammates you’re building with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A career in engineering is long enough to make plenty of mistakes and still come out ahead. The engineers I admire most aren’t the ones who got everything right - they’re the ones who learned from what went wrong, shared what they discovered, and kept showing up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re early in your journey, know that it gets richer with time. If you’re deep into it, I hope some of these resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trellis builds and deploys computer use agents to get patients access to life-saving medicine.&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our computer-use AI agents process billions of dollars worth of therapies annually with patients in all fifty states. We do this by automating document intake, prior authorizations, and appeals at scale to streamline operations and accelerate care. We classify medical referrals, understand chart notes, and automate contract and reimbursement search to provide patients with accurate coverage determinations and cost responsibility. Think of us as the Stripe of healthcare billing and reimbursements.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trellis is a spinout from Stanford AI Lab and is backed by leading investors including YC, General Catalyst, Telesoft Partners, and executives at Google and Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🧍🏻♂️Why work with us&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Real impact at massive scale: We serve patients in all fifty states and are scaling to hundreds of healthcare locations. You'll directly see the number of patients who received treatment because of the agents you built.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Work with industry experts: Apply your AI alongside healthcare operations leaders who have overseen 50+ healthcare locations, gaining deep domain expertise while building cutting-edge technology.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Be at the forefront of AI in healthcare: Build production-grade agentic systems that make critical healthcare decisions, backed by robust evaluation frameworks.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Direct customer engagement: Work closely with F500 customers and the founding team. You'll wear multiple hats from technical architecture to customer success.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Extreme ownership: Own key parts of Trellis's technical infrastructure and have opportunities to launch new initiatives that process billions in healthcare transactions.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;World-class team: Join team members who have won international physics olympiads, published economics research, were founding engineers at unicorn startups, and taught AI classes to hundreds of Stanford graduate students.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Incredible growth and traction: We've grown revenue 10x in the past few months alone and have XX% market share in the specialty healthcare markets we serve.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you'll build&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Agentic frameworks for healthcare decision-making: Design and implement AI systems that autonomously navigate complex reimbursement logic and prior authorization workflows.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;24/7 AI co-workers: Build and deploy long-running agent workers that triage and process healthcare data around the clock, functioning as reliable digital teammates for care teams.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Production-grade AI systems: Develop your agents within our comprehensive evaluation suite, ensuring production-ready performance from day one.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Experience architecting, developing, and testing full-stack code end-to-end&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Expertise in programming languages such as Python, Go and ML/NLP libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Being proactive and a fast-learner with bias for action&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Experience working with relational and non-relational databases, especially Postgres&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Experience with data and ML infrastructure&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Open source contributions and projects are a big plus&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Experience with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) is a plus&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Trellis helps healthcare providers treat more patients, faster—while eliminating pre-service paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We automate document intake, prior authorizations, and appeals at scale to streamline operations and accelerate care.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our AI agent is trained on millions of clinical data points and converts messy, unstructured documents into clean, structured data directly in your EHR.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With Trellis, leading healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies were able to:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Reduce time to treatment by over 90%&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Improve prior authorization approval and reimbursement rates&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Leverage structured data to enhance drug program performance and clinical decision-making&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Administrative costs account for over 20% of U.S. healthcare spending—delaying care, draining revenue, and driving staff burnout while having less visibility into patient care than ever before. We built Trellis to tackle this head on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Stop Forwarding Errors, Start Designing Them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s 3am. Production is down. You’re staring at a log line that says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know JSON is broke. But you have zero idea why, where, or who caused it. Was it the config loader? The user API? The webhook consumer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The error has successfully bubbled up through 20 layers of your stack, preserving its original message perfectly, yet losing every scrap of meaning along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a name for this. We call it “Error Handling.” But in reality, it’s just Error Forwarding. We treat errors like hot potatoes—catch them, wrap them (maybe), and throw them up the stack as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You add a &lt;code&gt;println!&lt;/code&gt;, restart the service, wait for the bug to reproduce. It’s going to be a long night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted in a detailed analysis of error handling in a large Rust project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“There’re tons of opinionated articles or libraries promoting their best practices, leading to an epic debate that never ends. We were all starting to notice that there was something wrong with the error handling practices, but pinpointing the exact problems is challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s Wrong with Current Practices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The &lt;code&gt;std::error::Error&lt;/code&gt; Trait: A Noble but Flawed Abstraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust’s &lt;code&gt;std::error::Error&lt;/code&gt; trait assumes errors form a chain—each error has an optional &lt;code&gt;source()&lt;/code&gt; pointing to the underlying cause. This works for most cases; the vast majority of errors have no source or a single one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as a standard library abstraction, it’s too opinionated. It categorically excludes cases where sources form a tree: a validation error with multiple field failures, a timeout with partial results. These scenarios exist, and the standard trait offers no way to represent them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Backtraces: Expensive Medicine for the Wrong Disease&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust’s &lt;code&gt;std::backtrace::Backtrace&lt;/code&gt; was meant to improve error observability. They’re better than nothing. But they have serious limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In async code, they’re nearly useless. Your backtrace will contain 49 stack frames, of which 12 are calls to &lt;code&gt;GenFuture::poll()&lt;/code&gt;. The Async Working Group notes that suspended tasks are invisible to traditional stack traces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They only show the origin, not the path. A backtrace tells you where the error was created, not the logical path it took through your application. It won’t tell you “this was the request handler for user X, calling service Y, with parameters Z.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Capturing backtraces is expensive. The standard library documentation acknowledges: “Capturing a backtrace can be a quite expensive runtime operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Provide/Request API: Overengineering in Action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Provider API (RFC 3192) and generic member access (RFC 2895) add dynamic type-based data access to errors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unstable &lt;code&gt;Provide&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt; API represents the latest attempt to make errors more flexible. The idea: errors can dynamically provide typed context (like HTTP status codes or backtraces) that callers can request at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sounds powerful. In practice, it introduces new problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unpredictability: Your error might provide an HTTP status code. Or it might not. You won’t know until runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complexity: The API is subtle enough that LLVM struggles to optimize multiple provide calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a simple struct with named fields is better than a clever abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;thiserror&lt;/code&gt;: Categorizing by Origin, Not by Action&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;thiserror&lt;/code&gt; makes it easy to define error enums:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks reasonable. But notice how this common practice categorizes errors: by origin, not by what the caller can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you receive a &lt;code&gt;DatabaseError::Query&lt;/code&gt;, what should you do? Retry? Report to the user? Log and continue? The error doesn’t tell you. It just tells you which dependency failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As one blogger aptly put it: “This error type does not tell the caller what problem you are solving but how you solve it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;anyhow&lt;/code&gt;: So Convenient You’ll Forget to Add Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;anyhow&lt;/code&gt; takes the opposite approach: type erasure. Just use &lt;code&gt;anyhow::Result&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; everywhere and propagate with &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;. No more enum variants, no more &lt;code&gt;#[from]&lt;/code&gt; annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? It’s too convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; is a missed opportunity to add context. What was the user ID? What API were we calling? What computation failed? The error knows none of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;anyhow&lt;/code&gt; documentation encourages using &lt;code&gt;.context()&lt;/code&gt; to add information. But &lt;code&gt;.context()&lt;/code&gt; is optional—the type system doesn’t require it. “I’ll add context later” is the easiest lie to tell yourself. Later means never—until 3am when production is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Problem: Error Handling Without Purpose&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this common pattern in Rust codebases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks reasonable. But ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can the caller do with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ServiceError::Database&lt;/code&gt;? Can they retry? Should they show the raw SQL error to users? The error type doesn’t help answer these questions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;When debugging at 3 AM, does “serialization error: expected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;” tell you which request, which field, which code path led here?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the fundamental disconnect in how we think about error handling. We focus on propagating errors exactly, on making the types line up, on satisfying the compiler. But we forget that errors are messages—messages that will eventually be read by either a machine trying to recover, or a human trying to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “Library vs Application” Myth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard the conventional wisdom: “Use &lt;code&gt;thiserror&lt;/code&gt; for libraries, &lt;code&gt;anyhow&lt;/code&gt; for applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a nice, simple rule, just not quite right. As Luca Palmieri notes: “It is not the right framing. You need to reason about intent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real question isn’t whether you’re writing a library or an application. The real question is: what do you expect the caller to do with this error?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two Audiences, Two Needs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s be explicit about who consumes errors and what they need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Audience&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Goal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Needs&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Machines&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Automated recovery&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Flat structure, clear error kinds, predictable codes&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Humans&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Debugging&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rich context, call path, business-level information&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a retry middleware receives an error, it doesn’t care about your beautifully nested error chain. It just needs to know: is this retryable? A simple boolean or enum variant suffices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re debugging at 3am, you don’t need to know that somewhere deep in the stack there was an &lt;code&gt;io::Error&lt;/code&gt;. You need to know: which file, which user, which request, what were we trying to do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most error handling designs optimize for neither audience. They optimize for the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;For Machines: Flat, Actionable, Kind-Based&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When errors need to be handled programmatically, complexity is the enemy. Your retry logic doesn’t want to traverse a nested error chain checking for specific variants. It wants to ask: &lt;code&gt;is_retryable()?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a pattern that works, drawn from Apache OpenDAL’s error design:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This design enables clear decision-making:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice the key design decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ErrorKind is categorized by response, not origin. &lt;code&gt;NotFound&lt;/code&gt; means “the thing doesn’t exist, don’t retry.” &lt;code&gt;RateLimited&lt;/code&gt; means “slow down and try again.” The caller doesn’t need to know whether it was an S3 404 or a filesystem ENOENT—they need to know what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ErrorStatus is explicit. Instead of guessing retryability from error types, it’s a first-class field. Services can mark errors as temporary when they know a retry might help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Error type per library. Instead of scattering error enums across modules, a single flat structure keeps things simple. The &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; field provides all the specificity you need without type proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No more traversing error chains, no more guessing from error types. Just ask the error directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;For Humans: Low-Friction Context Capture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest enemy of good error context isn’t capability—it’s friction. If adding context is annoying, developers won’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exn library (294 lines of Rust, zero dependencies) demonstrates one approach: errors form a tree of frames, each automatically capturing its source location via &lt;code&gt;#[track_caller]&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike linear error chains, trees can represent multiple causes—useful when parallel operations fail or validation produces multiple errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what we need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatic location capture. Instead of expensive backtraces, use &lt;code&gt;#[track_caller]&lt;/code&gt; to capture file/line/column at zero cost. Every error frame should know where it was created.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ergonomic context addition. The API for adding context should be so natural that not adding it feels wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare this to &lt;code&gt;thiserror&lt;/code&gt;, where adding the same context requires defining a new variant and manual wrapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforce context at module boundaries. This is where exn differs critically from &lt;code&gt;anyhow&lt;/code&gt;. With &lt;code&gt;anyhow&lt;/code&gt;, every error is erased to &lt;code&gt;anyhow::Error&lt;/code&gt;, so you can always use &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and move on—the type system won’t stop you. The context methods exist, but but nothing prevents you from ignoring them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;exn takes a different approach: &lt;code&gt;Exn&amp;lt;E&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; preserves the outermost error type. If your function returns &lt;code&gt;Result&amp;lt;T, Exn&amp;lt;ServiceError&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you can’t directly &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;Result&amp;lt;U, Exn&amp;lt;DatabaseError&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;—the types don’t match. The compiler forces you to call &lt;code&gt;or_raise()&lt;/code&gt; and provide a &lt;code&gt;ServiceError&lt;/code&gt;, which is exactly the moment you should be adding context about what your module was trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type system becomes your ally: it won’t let you be lazy at module boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what this looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; has context. When this fails at 3am, instead of the cryptic &lt;code&gt;serialization error&lt;/code&gt;, you see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you know: it was task 7829, we were fetching user data, and the connection was refused. You can grep for that task ID in your request logs and find everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting It Together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real systems, you often need both: machine-readable errors for automated recovery, and human-readable context for debugging. The pattern: use a flat, kind-based error type (like Apache OpenDAL’s) for the structured data, and wrap it in a context-tracking mechanism for propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the boundary, walk the error tree to find the structured error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, you still need to walk the tree. But unlike the &lt;code&gt;Provide&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt; API, you end up with a concrete type like &lt;code&gt;StorageError&lt;/code&gt;—a documented struct with named fields that your IDE can autocomplete. No guessing, no runtime surprises—just something you can reason about and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next time you write a function, look at the &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; return type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t think of it as “I might fail.” Think of it as “I might need to explain myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your error type can’t answer “Should I retry?”—you failed the Machine. If your error logs don’t answer “Which user was it?”—you failed the Human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Errors aren’t just failure modes to be propagated. They’re communication. They’re the messages your system sends when things go wrong. And like any communication, they deserve to be designed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop forwarding errors. Start designing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A curated catalogue of agentic AI patterns — real‑world tricks, workflows, and mini‑architectures that help autonomous or semi‑autonomous AI agents get useful work done in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why? Tutorials show toy demos. Real products hide the messy bits. This list surfaces the repeatable patterns that bridge the gap so we can all ship smarter, faster agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Traceable – backed by a public reference: blog post, talk, repo, or paper.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I run six Claude Code agents in parallel from my phone. No laptop, no desktop—just Termius on iOS and a cloud VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;flowchart LR
    A[Phone] --&amp;gt;|Termius + mosh| B[Tailscale VPN]
    B --&amp;gt; C[Vultr VM]
    C --&amp;gt; D[Claude Code]
    D --&amp;gt;|PreToolUse hook| E[Poke webhook]
    E --&amp;gt;|Push notification| A
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loop is: kick off a task, pocket the phone, get notified when Claude needs input. Async development from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Vultr VM in Silicon Valley:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Spec&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Instance&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;vhf-8c-32gb&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cost&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$0.29/hr (~$7/day when running)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Access&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tailscale-only (no public SSH)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I pay only when working. Two scripts handle lifecycle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vm-start   # Start VM, wait for Tailscale, connect via mosh
vm-stop    # Halt VM
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also have an iOS Shortcut that calls the Vultr API directly—start the VM from my phone before I even open Termius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VM’s public IP has no SSH listener. All access goes through Tailscale’s private network. Defense in depth: cloud firewall blocks everything except Tailscale coordination, local nftables as backup, fail2ban for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mobile Terminal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Termius handles SSH and mosh on iOS/Android. Mosh is the key—it survives network transitions. Switch from WiFi to cellular, walk through a dead zone, put the phone to sleep. The connection persists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mosh --ssh="ssh -p 47892" [email protected]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One gotcha: mosh doesn’t forward SSH agent. For git operations that need GitHub auth, I use regular SSH inside tmux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Session Persistence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shell auto-attaches to tmux on login. Close Termius, reopen hours later, everything’s still there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# In .zshrc
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]]; then
    tmux attach -t main 2&amp;gt;/dev/null || tmux new -s main
fi
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple Claude agents run in parallel windows. &lt;code&gt;C-a c&lt;/code&gt; for new window, &lt;code&gt;C-a n&lt;/code&gt; to cycle. Works well on a phone keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Push Notifications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what makes mobile development practical. Without notifications, you’d constantly check the terminal. With them, you can walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hook in &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/settings.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/hooks/poke-notify.sh question"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Claude calls &lt;code&gt;AskUserQuestion&lt;/code&gt;, the hook fires. A simple script extracts the question and POSTs to Poke’s webhook:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QUESTION=$(echo "$EVENT_DATA" | jq -r '.tool_input.questions[0].question')
MESSAGE="$PROJECT_NAME: Claude needs input - $QUESTION"
curl -X POST "$API_URL" -d "{\"message\": \"$MESSAGE\"}"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone buzzes. Notification shows the question. Tap, respond, continue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trust Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run Claude Code in permissive mode. The VM is isolated—no access to production systems, no secrets beyond what’s needed for development. Worst case: Claude does something unexpected on a disposable VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost control adds another layer. The VM costs $0.29/hr. Even if something runs away, the daily cap is bounded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parallel Development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Git worktrees let me run multiple features simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;~/Code/myproject/              # main
~/Code/myproject-sidebar/      # feature branch
~/Code/myproject-dark-mode/    # another feature
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each worktree gets its own tmux window with a Claude agent. Port allocation is hash-based—deterministic from branch name, no conflicts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;hash_val = sum(ord(c) for c in branch_name)
django_port = 8001 + (hash_val % 99)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six agents, six features, one phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What This Enables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review PRs while waiting for coffee. Kick off a refactor on the train. Fix a bug from the couch while watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern: start a task that will take Claude 10-20 minutes, do something else, get notified, respond, repeat. Development fits into the gaps of the day instead of requiring dedicated desk time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tool&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Purpose&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Vultr&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cloud VM ($0.29/hr, pay-per-use)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tailscale&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Private network, secure access&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Termius&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;iOS/Android SSH client&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;mosh&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Network-resilient shell&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;tmux&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Session persistence&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Poke&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Push notifications via webhook&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Code&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The actual work&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup took one Claude Code session to build—gave it my Vultr API key and access to &lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt;, asked for a secure dev VM. Now I code from my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Multiplayer-First Server-Rendered Game Engine with Lua Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;Play Demo: Astro Maze&lt;code&gt;curl -fsSL https://cleoselene.com/install | bash&lt;/code&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Supported: macOS (Universal: M1/M2/M3 &amp;amp; Intel), Linux (x64). Windows soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code multiplayer games as simple as single-player. No more worrying about client-server state sync or lag compensation. Just one loop, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We stream drawing primitives instead of heavy pixels or complex state objects. It's faster than cloud gaming and lighter than traditional networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All performance-critical logic (Physics, Pathfinding) runs in Native Rust. Communication is powered by WebRTC for sub-frame latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the game is entirely server-rendered, the client has zero knowledge of the game state. No wallhacks, no aimbots, no compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your game's internal logic and secrets safe. Since your script never leaves the server, players can't reverse-engineer your code or find hidden content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total freedom. This version of the engine is free for personal or commercial use on your own infrastructure. No lock-in, no per-player fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the binary and run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cleoselene my_game.lua&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Multiplayer-First Server-Rendered Game Engine with Lua Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minimal game script (&lt;code&gt;main.lua&lt;/code&gt;) must implement these callbacks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- Called once when the server starts
function init()

end

-- Called every server frame (typically 30 TPS)
function update(dt)
    -- Advance physics simulation
    phys:step(dt)

    -- Handle collisions
    local events = phys:get_collision_events()
    for _, pair in ipairs(events) do
        -- Handle game logic (damage, score)
    end
end

-- Called for EACH connected client to generate their frame
function draw(session_id)
    api.clear_screen(20, 20, 30)

    -- Draw player-specific view (camera, HUD)
    local p = players[session_id]
    if p then
        api.set_color(255, 255, 255)
        api.draw_text("HP: " .. p.hp, 10, 10)

&lt;p&gt;The engine uses a fixed virtual coordinate system of 800x600. All drawing commands (&lt;code&gt;api.fill_rect&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;api.draw_line&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) use these coordinates. The engine automatically scales the output to fit the user's screen while maintaining the logical resolution and aspect ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Method&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.clear_screen(r, g, b)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Clears the frame with a background color.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.set_color(r, g, b, [a])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Sets the current drawing color.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.fill_rect(x, y, w, h)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Draws a filled rectangle.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.draw_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, [width])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Draws a line.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.draw_text(text, x, y)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Draws text at position.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.load_sound(name, url)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Preloads a sound from a URL/path (relative to script).&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.play_sound(name, [loop])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Plays a loaded sound.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.stop_sound(name)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Stops a sound.&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;api.set_volume(name, volume)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Sets volume (0.0 to 1.0).&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engine provides a high-performance Spatial Hash Grid for broadphase queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;local db = api.new_spatial_db(cell_size) -- e.g., 250

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I changed my personality in six weeks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on emerging research showing people can shift their core personality traits, Laurie Clarke tried tweaking hers. Here's what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I noticed a recurring itch in my hand a few months ago, I immediately remembered an article I'd once read about people with mysterious itches so maddening they scratch and claw until they tear through their own flesh – sometimes disabling or even killing themselves in the process. I thought, panicked, "that's probably about to happen to me".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I experience similar episodes on a semi-regular basis. So it wasn't entirely surprising when I scored higher than 85% of people on neuroticism in a personality test I took online. I've been neurotic since my teen years, when I suffered my first panic attack. It is dimming with age, thanks, I believe, to my own piecemeal interventions: reducing self-criticism, trying not to agonise over every social interaction and the multifarious ways in which I surely humiliated myself, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then my editor offered me an intriguing assignment: would I like to try tweaking some aspects of my personality, drawing on emerging research from the field of personality change? (Given we've never met face to face, I didn't take this personally.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The psychological model for personality with the most scientific backing is the "Big Five", which breaks it down into five dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Each is further subdivided into traits, so neuroticism, for example, includes excessive worrying, rumination and emotional instability; extraversion includes assertiveness and gregariousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Psychologists once assumed personality was pretty intractable. "Some of my colleagues back in the 80s argued it was fixed by the age of 30 and things like that," says Brent Roberts, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the US and one of the most influential personality researchers. "A lot of research has emerged in the last three decades that has moderated that position."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Psychologists have found that people tend to become less neurotic and more conscientious and agreeable over the course of a lifetime. Researchers now think these changes "result from both biological maturation and the accumulation of life experiences that encourage grown-up responsibilities", says Mirjam Stieger, a researcher in personality change at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In recent years, psychologists have carried out more studies on personality change, and newer research indicates we can expedite this effect through conscious choices. A growing number of studies suggest that with targeted interventions, we can achieve the degree of personality change typically seen over a lifetime in just a few months. For my own experiment, I only had six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first port of call was an online personality test to assess where I currently scored on the Big Five. It turns out that in addition to sky-high neuroticism, I'm also very "open", scoring in the 93rd percentile (meaning I'm more open than 93% of people). Openness indicates receptivity to new experiences and ideas, so I took this to be generally positive. My conscientiousness was also very high – little surprise since I was an inveterate striver at school and still exhibit an unfortunate tendency towards perfectionism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My agreeableness wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. High scorers in agreeableness tend to be considerate, cooperative, trusting and well-liked. I scored in the 50th percentile. There were a few questions I wish I could've answered differently, but I wasn't quite there yet. I begrudgingly agreed that I was generally "suspicious of others' intentions'" and disagreed that I have "a forgiving nature".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My neuroticism might be the worst thing about my personality, but it's far from the only thing I'd change. Like many bookish introverts, I grew up menaced by the idealised image of the extraverted social butterfly, flapping its giant wings obnoxiously near my fragile self-esteem. At one point I thought I might eventually become one, but long ago acquiesced to the knowledge that this would never be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, a little more extraversion couldn't hurt – especially given that I recently moved to a new city where my partner and I don't know anyone and are keen to make friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically, people want to become more extraverted and conscientious, while being less neurotic. I wanted to become a little more extraverted, much less neurotic and a little less conscientious insofar as it pertains to perfectionism. I also wanted to become more agreeable, because I think a lack of trust in others is one of the things that sustains my neuroticism. Conversely, a lot of people say they want to become less agreeable because they associate the quality with being a pushover, says Roberts. (It's true that less agreeable people tend to earn more money).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studies show that socially desirable changes to our personalities could transform our lives for the better. Lower neuroticism and higher extraversion in particular are linked to higher life satisfaction. But how to go about it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2019 study led by personality psychologist Nathan Hudson from Southern Methodist University in Texas looked at whether an active intervention could shift target traits over time. The researchers asked student participants to pick aspects of their personalities they'd like to change and then complete weekly challenges "that would pull their thoughts, feelings and behaviours in line with their desired traits".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of 15 weeks, the results indicated the students were able to affect small but statistically significant changes in their desired traits including extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism, but not openness or agreeableness. Those who completed more challenges underwent the greatest transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stieger conducted a similar intervention supported by a smartphone app in 2021, which also produced desired changes in extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism and agreeableness, but not openness. The alterations persisted at a three-month check in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Hudson's paper, I cribbed a set of activities to encourage change in each of my target personality dimensions. Here's a sampling from all of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Decreasing neuroticism: Start to meditate daily, write a regular gratitude journal, try to counter a negative thought with a positive one – or merely write the thought down and how it makes you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Increasing extraversion: Go to events to meet new people, say hello to a cashier at a shop, open up and honestly tell a friend how your life's going right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Increasing agreeableness: Do a small kindness to someone close to you, when you intend to say something mean about someone say something positive instead, if someone does something irritating come up with three external factors that might explain their behaviour (e.g. "they were having a bad day") rather than internal factors (e.g. "they're a bad person").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Increasing conscientiousness: Pay a bill as soon as you receive it, organise and clean up your desk, spend 30 minutes writing down a list of your short term and long-term goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Increasing openness: Read a news story about a foreign country, go to a poetry reading, visit a museum or gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interventions rely on a mixture of adapting thought patterns and attitudes and testing out new behaviours. The overarching logic is, if you want to become somebody different, start thinking and acting like them. Put another way: fake it until you make it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers usually focus on interventions lasting a few months, so to speed things up for my six week timeframe I prioritised activities that ostensibly targeted several personality traits at once. By going to a yoga class or opening up to a friend, for example, I could improve my neuroticism, agreeableness and extraversion simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was frankly too afraid to try some of the activities. "Offer to get someone in line's coffee at a café" made me concerned the target would think I was clumsily flirting with them or covertly filming them for one of those insipid feel-good YouTube videos. I'd need so many drinks before striking up "a conversation with a stranger at a bar" that the deleterious health impacts would surely outweigh any lift to mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And self-affirmations are always going to feel ridiculous if, like me, you hail from a long line of emotionally parsimonious Scots. I did say "I choose to be happy today" out loud, but not without a self-effacing smirk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried out as many of the activities as I could. I'd dragged myself along to a few social activities in my new city in summer but was on the cusp of retreating into hibernation when I received this assignment, which encouraged me not to give up for the year. I made a renewed effort to attend local activities, as well as to see friends who live nearby and to arrange phone calls with those abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought attending meetups with strangers would be enormously disruptive to my hermetic home-working existence, imagining I'd need days to convalesce after attending a new book club. In fact, the opposite was true. The more events I attended, the easier it became.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went to a life drawing class that I'd enjoyed a few months prior but hadn't returned to. Last time, during the break, I had contorted myself defensively around my phone while people milled around with glasses of wine. This time, I adopted a friendly posture and found engaging with people surprisingly natural. At a yoga class near the end of my six weeks of experimentation, I found myself doing something almost unheard of: I spontaneously initiated small talk with the person one mat over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also began meditating and writing a gratitude journal nearly every day. The meditation turned out to be revelatory. At first it was near impossible to silence the din of thoughts. As well as the classic intrusions about what I needed to do that day, there was also a relentless rabbity commentary on what I was experiencing moment-to-moment while attempting to meditate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The incontinent babblerer at the steering wheel of my mind seemed to fear being asked to step out of the vehicle for a while – scared, perhaps, that it wouldn't be allowed to return. But after my partner suggested I visualise it not as leaving the vehicle but simply cutting the engine, I stopped fearing the silence. I also began to see the merit of encouraging its spread to parts of my life that were otherwise characterised by a frenzy of nervous chatter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve neuroticism, "you target people's willingness to experience emotions", says Shannon Sauer-Zavala, associate professor in psychology at the University of Kentucky in the US. Shesays that neurotics chronically avoid emotions, as well as lambasting themselves for feeling the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sauer-Zavala is working on an intriguing approach to treating mental health conditions through personality-targeted interventions. "If we target neuroticism instead of general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, panic disorder, eating disorders etc, it's just more efficient," she says. So far, results indicate the approach is effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neuroticism is not the only personality dimension that can cause psychological vulnerabilities. Sauer-Zavala says high levels of conscientiousness can tip into perfectionism, something I relate to. The interventions Sauer-Zavala suggests for this make my skin crawl: "Figure out what 80% of your best job is, do that and stop there and see what happens," she says. "Or send an email with a typo, or leave work at five o'clock every day this week. It's usually the most anti-climactic thing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I compulsively check and re-check any bit of work or correspondence before I send it off. After Sauer-Zavala's comments, I try to stop myself before doing a final-final-final check on a bit of corporate work, and just send it. I can't help opening it once more afterwards and spot what I see as a glaring error, the close repetition of a certain word. I feel a pang – see! But of course she's right, it doesn't matter in the slightest, and I quickly forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of my six weeks of experimentation, I didn't feel radically different, but I did feel pretty good. The moment had come to re-take the test. Early on, I sensed that I might evince some changes. In answer to a question about whether I was "outgoing and sociable", I felt sure I would have previously disagreed. This time, I had six weeks of unignorable data in front of me. Objectively, I had socialised, often with strangers, and had a not bad time. So maybe I was sociable after all. The researchers were right that acting in a certain way can change your perception of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Our 2,500-year-old mania for personality types&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How birth order shapes your personality&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How your personality changes as you age&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Answering questions like this helped push me from the 30th percentile on extraversion to the 50th. On agreeableness, I also hugely improved, shifting from the 50th to the 70th percentile. It seemed that thinking nice things about people had indeed made me more positively disposed to humanity. On neuroticism, I showed a marked improvement, dropping from the 83rd percentile to 50th. I stayed roughly the same on conscientiousness and openness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the six weeks, I was still frequently besieged by self-doubt and afflicted by a number of ridiculous health paranoias. But I felt more able to treat these for what they were – passing ephemera that didn't have to hold any grander significance. Sometimes clearly articulating the worry in my head was enough to render it untenably ludicrous. Keeping the gratitude journal reminded me that not long before I had found things to be positive about, and likely would do again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was, of course, a highly unscientific study of one, but I still feel compelled to highlight several potentially muddying factors in the results. For one thing, I had wanted to change for the sake of this article, which could obviously have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, I re-took the test the day after I'd attended a new local meet-up for writers, and the evening before that I had met a friend for dinner. I was flying high off recent social successes; it was sunny and I was in a good mood. If I retreated back into monastic solitude and ditched the journalling, could I undergo backsliding over the coming months? It's certainly possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, my results were roughly in line with those obtained by personality studies to date. Stieger's study, for instance, found personality traits shifted in the desired directions by an average of half of a standard deviation, the equivalent of shifting from the 50th percentile to the 65-70th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a limp gesture towards scientific rigour, I asked my partner to complete the test alongside me at the beginning and the end of the six weeks. He was my "control" subject; he hadn't done anything to try to change his personality. At the end, his results came out pretty much unchanged: very high neuroticism, high openness, middling agreeableness and extraversion, and low conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With even the most effective personality interventions, it's important not to overstate the impacts. The greatest changes recorded by studies to date are "huge…by researchers' standards" says Roberts. "Is it huge from a layperson's perspective? Probably not. It seems, generally speaking, most people stay mostly the same."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And although the vast majority of people profess to want to change at least one aspect of their personality, those who will put the effort in are surely far fewer. When my partner learns of my results, he is impressed. "So I could change if I wanted to?" he muses. He reflects for a moment. "I don't feel like it though."&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Some resources may require specific IAM permissions not covered by basic read-only policies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resource counts may vary during loading due to pagination&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some global services (IAM, Route53, CloudFront) always use us-east-1&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What is OpenGitOps?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenGitOps is a set of open-source standards, best practices, and community-focused education to help organizations adopt a structured, standardized approach to implementing GitOps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GitOps Principles v1.0.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Declarative&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Versioned and Immutable&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Pulled Automatically&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Continuously Reconciled&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get Involved&lt;/p&gt;
