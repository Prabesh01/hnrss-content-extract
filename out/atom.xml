    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The truth behind the 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.8k words, 13 minutes reading time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: I am co-hosting an event in SF on Friday, Jan 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1654, a Jesuit polymath named Athanasius Kircher published Mundus Subterraneus, a comprehensive geography of the Earth’s interior. It had maps and illustrations and rivers of fire and vast subterranean oceans and air channels connecting every volcano on the planet. He wrote that “the whole Earth is not solid but everywhere gaping, and hollowed with empty rooms and spaces, and hidden burrows.”. Alongside comments like this, Athanasius identified the legendary lost island of Atlantis, pondered where one could find the remains of giants, and detailed the kinds of animals that lived in this lower world, including dragons. The book was based entirely on secondhand accounts, like travelers tales, miners reports, classical texts, so it was as comprehensive as it could’ve possibly been.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Athanasius had never been underground and neither had anyone else, not really, not in a way that mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I am in San Francisco, the site of the 2026 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, and it feels a lot like Mundus Subterraneus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is ostensibly plenty of evidence to believe that the conference exists, that it actually occurs between January 12, 2026 to January 16, 2026 at the Westin St. Francis Hotel, 335 Powell Street, San Francisco, and that it has done so for the last forty-four years, just like everyone has told you. There is a website for it, there are articles about it, there are dozens of AI-generated posts on Linkedin about how excited people were about it. But I have never met anyone who has actually been inside the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never been approached by one, or seated next to one, or introduced to one. They do not appear in my life. They do not appear in anyone’s life that I know. I have put my boots on the ground to rectify this, and asked around, first casually and then less casually, “Do you know anyone who has attended the JPM conference?”, and then they nod, and then I refine the question to be, “No, no, like, someone who has actually been in the physical conference space”, then they look at me like I’ve asked if they know anyone who’s been to the moon. They know it happens. They assume someone goes. Not them, because, just like me, ordinary people like them do not go to the moon, but rather exist around the moon, having coffee chats and organizing little parties around it, all while trusting that the moon is being attended to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conference has six focuses: AI in Drug Discovery and Development, AI in Diagnostics, AI for Operational Efficiency, AI in Remote and Virtual Healthcare, AI and Regulatory Compliance, and AI Ethics and Data Privacy. There is also a seventh theme over ‘Keynote Discussions’, the three of which are The Future of AI in Precision Medicine, Ethical AI in Healthcare, and Investing in AI for Healthcare. Somehow, every single thematic concept at this conference has converged onto artificial intelligence as the only thing worth seriously discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t this strange? Surely, you must feel the same thing as me, the inescapable suspicion that the whole show is being put on by an unconscious Chinese Room, its only job to pass over semi-legible symbols over to us with no regards as to what they actually mean. In fact, this pattern is consistent across not only how the conference communicates itself, but also how biopharmaceutical news outlets discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each year, Endpoints News and STAT and BioCentury and FiercePharma all publish extensive coverage of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. I have read the articles they have put out, and none of it feels like it was written by someone who actually was at the event. There is no emotional energy, no personal anecdotes, all of it has been removed, shredded into one homogeneous, smoothie-like texture. The coverage contains phrases like “pipeline updates” and “strategic priorities” and “catalysts expected in the second half.” If the writers of these articles ever approach a human-like tenor, it is in reference to the conference’s “tone”. The tone is “cautiously optimistic.” The tone is “more subdued than expected.” The tone is “mixed.” What does this mean? What is a mixed tone? What is a cautiously optimistic tone? These are not descriptions of a place. They are more accurately descriptions of a sentiment, abstracted from any physical reality, hovering somewhere above the conference like a weather system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could write this coverage. I could write it from my horrible apartment in New York City, without attending anything at all. I could say: “The tone at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference was cautiously optimistic, with executives expressing measured enthusiasm about near-term catalysts while acknowledging macroeconomic headwinds.” I made that up in fifteen seconds. Does it sound fake? It shouldn’t, because it sounds exactly like the coverage of a supposedly real thing that has happened every year for the last forty-four years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the astral body I mentioned earlier, there is an interesting historical parallel to draw there. In 1835, the New York Sun published a series of articles claiming that the astronomer Sir John Herschel had discovered life on the moon. Bat-winged humanoids, unicorns, temples made of sentient sapphire, that sort of stuff. The articles were detailed, describing not only these creatures appearance, but also their social behaviors and mating practices. All of these cited Herschel’s observations through a powerful new telescope. The series was a sensation. It was also, obviously, a hoax, the Great Moon Hoax as it came to be known. Importantly, the hoax worked not because the details were plausible, but because they had the energy of genuine reporting: Herschel was a real astronomer, and telescopes were real, and the moon was real, so how could any combination that involved these three be fake?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To clarify: I am not saying the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I am saying is that I, nor anybody, can tell the difference between the conference coverage and a very well-executed hoax. Consider that the Great Moon Hoax was walking a very fine tightrope between giving the appearance of seriousness, while also not giving away too many details that’d let the cat out of the bag. Here, the conference rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example: photographs. You would think there would be photographs. The (claimed) conference attendees number in the thousands, many of them with smartphones, all of them presumably capable of pointing a camera at a thing and pressing a button. But the photographs are strange, walking that exact snickering line that the New York Sun walked. They are mostly photographs of the outside of the Westin St. Francis, or they are photographs of people standing in front of step-and-repeat banners, or they are photographs of the schedule, displayed on a screen, as if to prove that the schedule exists. But photographs of the inside with the panels, audience, the keynotes in progress; these are rare. And when I do find them, they are shot from angles that reveal nothing, that could be anywhere, that could be a Marriott ballroom in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this a conspiracy theory? You can call it that, but I have a very professional online presence, so I personally wouldn’t. In fact, I wouldn’t even say that the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is not real, but rather that it is real, but not actually materially real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explain what I mean, we can rely on economist Thomas Schelling to help us out. Sixty-six years ago, Schelling proposed a thought experiment: if you had to meet a stranger in New York City on a specific day, with no way to communicate beforehand, where would you go? The answer, for most people, is Grand Central Station, at noon. Not because Grand Central Station is special. Not because noon is special. But because everyone knows that everyone else knows that Grand Central Station at noon is the obvious choice, and this mutual knowledge of mutual knowledge is enough to spontaneously produce coordination out of nothing. This, Grand Central Station and places just like it, are what’s known as a Schelling point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schelling points appear when they are needed, burnt into our genetic code, Pleistocene subroutines running on repeat, left over from when we were small and furry and needed to know, without speaking, where the rest of the troop would be when the leopards came. The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, on the second week of January, every January, Westin St. Francis, San Francisco, is what happened when that ancient coordination instinct was handed an industry too vast and too abstract to organize by any other means. Something deep drives us to gather here, at this time, at this date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To preempt the obvious questions: I don’t know why this particular location or time or demographic were chosen. I especially don’t know why J.P. Morgan of all groups was chosen to organize the whole thing. All of this simply is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find any of this hard to believe, observe that the whole event is, structurally, a religious pilgrimage, and has all the quirks you may expect of a religious pilgrimage. And I don’t mean that as a metaphor, I mean it literally, in every dimension except the one where someone official admits it, and J.P. Morgan certainly won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the elements. A specific place, a specific time, an annual cycle, a journey undertaken by the faithful, the presence of hierarchy and exclusion, the production of meaning through ritual rather than content. The hajj requires Muslims to circle the Kaaba seven times. The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference requires devotees of the biopharmaceutical industry to slither into San Francisco for five days, nearly all of them—in my opinion, all of them—never actually entering the conference itself, but instead orbiting it, circumambulating it, taking coffee chats in its gravitational field. The Kaaba is a cube containing, according to tradition, nothing, an empty room, the holiest empty room in the world. The Westin St. Francis is also, roughly, a cube. I am not saying these are the same thing. I am saying that we have, as a species, a deep and unexamined relationship to cubes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my strongest theory so far. That the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference isn’t exactly real or unreal, but a mass-coordination social contract that has been unconsciously signed by everyone in this industry, transcending the need for an underlying referent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My skeptical readers will protest at this, and they would be correct to do so. The story I have written out is clean, but it cannot be fully correct. Thomas Schelling was not so naive as to believe that Schelling points spontaneously generate out of thin air, there is always a reason, a specific, grounded reason, that their concepts become the low-energy metaphysical basins that they are. Grand Central Station is special because of the cultural gravitas it has accumulated through popular media. Noon is special because that is when the sun reaches its zenith. The Kaaba was worshipped because it was not some arbitrary cube; the cube itself was special, that it contained The Black Stone, set into the eastern corner, a relic that predates Islam itself, that some traditions claim fell from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there are signs, if you know where to look, that the underlying referent for the Westin St. Francis status being a gathering area is physical. Consider the heat. It is January in San Francisco, usually brisk, yet the interior of the Westin St. Francis maintains a distinct, humid microclimate. Consider the low-frequency vibration in the lobby that ripples the surface of water glasses, but doesn’t seem to register on local, public seismographs. There is something about the building itself that feels distinctly alien. But, upon standing outside the building for long enough, you’ll have the nagging sensation that it is not something about the hotel that feels off, but rather, what lies within, underneath, and around the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no easy way to sugarcoat this, so I’ll just come out and say it: it is possible that the entirety of California is built on top of one immensely large organism, and the particular spot in which the Westin St. Francis Hotel stands—335 Powell Street, San Francisco, 94102—is located directly above its beating heart. And that this is the primary organizing focal point for both the location and entire reason for the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe that the hotel maintains dozens of meter-thick polyvinyl chloride plastic tubes that have been threaded down through the basement, through the bedrock, through geological strata, and into the cardiovascular system of something that has been lying beneath the Pacific coast since before the Pacific coast existed. That the hotel is a singular, thirty-two story central line. That, during the week of the conference, hundreds of gallons of drugs flow through these tubes, into the pulsating mass of the being, pouring down arteries the size of canyons across California. The dosing takes five days; hence the length of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I do not believe that the drugs being administered here are simply sedatives. They are, in fact, the opposite of sedatives. The drugs are keeping the thing beneath California alive. There is something wrong with the creature, and a select group of attendees at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference have become its primary caretakers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? The answer is obvious: there is nothing good that can come from having an organic creature that spans hundreds of thousands of square miles suddenly die, especially if that same creatures mass makes up a substantial portion of the fifth-largest economy on the planet, larger than India, larger than the United Kingdom, larger than most countries that we think of as significant. Maybe letting the nation slide off into the sea was an option at one point, but not anymore. California produces more than half of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States. California produces the majority of the world’s entertainment. California produces the technology that has restructured human communication. Nobody can afford to let the whole thing collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, perhaps it was decided that California must survive, at least for as long as possible. Hence Amgen. Hence Genentech. Hence the entire biotech revolution, which we are taught to understand as a triumph of science and entrepreneurship, a story about venture capital and recombinant DNA and the genius of the California business climate. The story is not false, but incomplete. The reason for the revolution was, above all else, because the creature needed medicine, and the old methods of making medicine were no longer adequate, and someone decided that the only way to save the patient was to create an entire industry dedicated to its care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is drug development so expensive? Because the real R&amp;amp;D costs are for the primary patient, the being underneath California, and human applications are an afterthought, a way of recouping investment. Why do so many clinical trials fail? For the same reason; the drugs are not meant for our species. Why is the industry concentrated in San Francisco, San Diego, Boston? Because these are monitoring stations, places where other intravenous lines have been drilled into other organs, other places where the creature surfaces close enough to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the hotel itself. The Westin St. Francis was built in 1904, and, throughout its entire existence, it has never, ever, even once, closed or stopped operating. The 1906 earthquake leveled most of San Francisco, and the Westin St. Francis did not fall. It was damaged, yes, but it did not fall. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake killed sixty-three people and collapsed a section of the Bay Bridge. Still, the Westin St. Francis did not fall. It cannot fall, because if it falls, the central line is severed, and if the central line is severed, the creature dies, and if the creature dies, we lose California, and if we lose California, our civilization loses everything that California has been quietly holding together. And so the Westin St. Francis has hosted every single J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference since 1983, has never missed one, has never even come close to missing one, and will not miss the next one, or the one after that, or any of the ones that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think about it, this all makes a lot of sense. It may also seem very unlikely, but unlikely things have been known to happen throughout history. Mundus Subterraneus had a section on the “seeds of metals,” a theory that gold and silver grew underground like plants, sprouting from mineral seeds in the moist, oxygen-poor darkness. This was wrong, but the intuition beneath it was not entirely misguided. We now understand that the Earth’s mantle is a kind of eternal engine of astronomical size, cycling matter through subduction zones and volcanic systems, creating and destroying crust. Athanasius was wrong about the mechanism, but right about the structure. The earth is not solid. It is everywhere gaping, hollowed with empty rooms, and it is alive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is for early-stage (Seed, Series A) founders who think they have engineering management problems (building eng teams, motivating and performance-managing engineers, structuring work/projects, prioritizing, shipping on time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gist: if you think you have these problems, it is likely that the correct solution is to do nothing, to not manage, and to go back to building product and talking to users. Put another way, and having managed teams at all scales, I don’t think it’s a good use of your time as a founder to be "managing" engineers at such an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following sections, I'll go through the most typical anti-patterns I've seen, and try to highlight a better use of your time if you think you've hit the situation in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not try to "motivate" your engineers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common concern of many founders is making sure that their engineers are working hard. This could mean putting in long hours, working more than competitors, completing heroic codebase rewrites, etc. When these external signs of effort seem to be missing, founders worry that the team is not "motivated", and it can be very tempting to treat symptoms over causes. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;creating cultural norms around putting in long hours (996-style culture) by either requiring or celebrating them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;scheduling recurring or non-urgent meetings on weekends (e.g. standup on Saturdays)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;micro-managing tasks, or asking people for status reports and other evidence they worked hard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These anti-patterns share one thing in common: they start with founders trying to actively do something to motivate the team. This has 2 consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This can cause the very engineers you want to retain (those who have many options) to self-select out of your engineering culture. I know several top 1% engineers in the Valley who disengage from recruiting processes when 996 or something similar is mentioned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You are wasting your mental energy on the wrong problem&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is a long way of saying that motivation is an inherent trait of great startup engineers. Your only job is to hire these engineers, and then to maintain an environment where they want to do their best work. And yes, at that point, you may see them working long hours and doing heroic actions you did not even think were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Motivation is a hired trait. The only place where managers motivate people is in management books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll dedicate a post to specific ways you can identify motivation during hiring, but in short, look for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the obvious one: evidence that they indeed exhibited these external signs of motivation (in an unforced way!) in past jobs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;signs of grit in their career and life paths (how did they respond to adversity, how have they put their past successes or reputation on the line for some new challenge)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;intellectual curiosity in the form of hobbies, nerdy interests that they can talk about with passion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bias for action and fast decision speed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, as a founder, you should definitely be the most motivated person, in an authentic way (maybe it's some piece of heroic coding, maybe it's taking 2am meetings with European customers, maybe it's something else unique to you). Cultivating your own inner motivation is the most effective way to set the tone for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not hire managers too soon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most obvious external sign that a startup has switched from building a product to building a company is to add management roles. When this switch happens prematurely, a lot of energy gets spent on stage-irrelevant problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By definition, an engineering manager needs to manage a team and projects, but if the team is still working on defining what they should be building, there is nothing to manage. Even the most intellectually honest manager will start outputting "management work", such as having 1:1s with everyone, doing some career coaching, applying order to the chaos of potential features by putting them in JIRA tickets or issues, etc. Here's what it means for you as a founder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you are still trying to find product-market fit and build your initial product&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an engineering manager is helping you do it in a more optimized way, but they are optimizing a moving target so it does not really improve anything&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you don't know if this engineering manager is bad at their job, or if the engineers are not performing, or if the product has no market anyway, or all of the above&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you define "too soon"? Let's look at a few typical inflection points, assuming at least one founder is technical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The founding stage (5-6 engineers including founders)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously too soon to hire managers or turn someone into a manager. The only management-like tasks for the founders are hiring and firing, other than that the team should largely be self-organizing and self-sustaining with lightweight tooling (a simple doc can even be used as a task tracker, 1:1s happen organically and are infrequent, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, the bias should be towards doing nothing in terms of management and everything in terms of hiring exceptional people who inherently work well together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The multi-team stage (2 or 3 sub-teams of 5 engineers, 10-15 people total)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be late seed or series A, with an inkling of a working product. Many teams will decide to implement management at this stage, because it seems like the natural next step. The decision is full of nuances, but I would strongly advise to have all the engineers still report into a single person (ideally the co-founder CTO). Why? Speed of execution and culture, mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;at 15 engineers, it is very doable for a single person to keep track of everyone's work and ensure alignment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;this is the critical moment where you build the engineering culture that will bring you from here to hundreds of engineers (how do we hire, what do we value, how do we work together, etc.). It's much easier to do this as a flat team with a single leader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pivots and radical decisions could still happen frequently, which will be exponentially harder if you have to manage these engineers through 2 or 3 line managers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only nuance I would add, if you really need to start structuring the team, is to go with hybrid roles: maybe it's a very hands-on manager who still codes 70% of the time, maybe it's elevating a few key engineers into informal tech lead positions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The early growth stage (going from 20 to 50 engineers)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the sweet spot where the benefit of adding more management and more structure should outweigh the cost of letting the inevitable chaos of a larger team take a life of its own. Still, I would highly recommend a less-is-more approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few signs you've reached that stage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the CTO / whoever is managing everyone shows signs of burning out under the load&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;adding more engineers no longer increases output, meaning you are constrained by team inefficiency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the team excels at week-to-week impact, but nobody seems able to play out what will happen in 3 to 6 months&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a vast topic, and I'll dedicate a future article to that specific stage, including how to hire your first head of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Do not copy Google&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section addresses two sides of the same coin, both related to the halo effect surrounding great companies and more specifically their management practices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Applying management ideas that Google (or other successful company) have talked about and made popular&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Applying the meta-idea of innovating in the field of management (like Google did in their time)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll skip to the conclusion and explain it below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When in doubt, always pick the "node &amp;amp; postgres" stack of management. Do not innovate, keep it boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What I mean by the "node &amp;amp; postgres" of management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Node &amp;amp; postgres share these common traits: they have huge communities, their bugs and quirks have been explored by millions of people, and so they are great choices for early-stage startups compared to, say, C++ and OracleDB. No matter what you think about their technical merits, it would be very hard to point to them as a reason why a startup failed. They are just solid, boring tools, and they work at the early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should use the same type of boring, widely used, stage-appropriate tools when it comes to managing your startup. Every ounce of "innovation" you spend on your organizational structure, title philosophy, or new-age 1:1 is an ounce you aren't spending on your product. At the seed stage, your culture shouldn't be unique because of your clever peer feedback system, it should be unique because of the speed at which you solve customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is the boring stack of seed stage management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a conclusion to this section and to the entire article, I want to share, somewhat paradoxically, a few useful management activities specifically for the early stage. They almost all share the same "reluctant" approach to engineering management, which I think is a healthy leadership approach at that particular stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hire inherently motivated people: see first section&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't manage around a hiring mistake, let them go quickly and gracefully&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Asynchronous status updates: do not adopt all the "Scrum rituals" like standups, retros, etc. wholesale, and if you do, keep them asynchronous. There is little added value to a voiced update, even if it makes you feel good that people are indeed working hard and showing up to the standup on time!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An avoidant relationship to Slack: while Slack is a given in today's distributed or hybrid teams, it can quickly become an attention destroyer, especially for engineers who need uninterrupted time to work. Keep it in check.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Organic 1:1s (as opposed to recurring ones): keep them topic-heavy and ad-hoc, as opposed to relationship maintenance like in the corporate world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unstructured documents over systems of records: unless you need to itemize tasks for audit purposes, a few notion or google docs can actually scale for 10-15 engineers, especially given current AI tools. They have very little overhead and are unbeatable in terms of flexibility.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extreme transparency: give everyone access to everything (customer call notes, investor updates, budgets, etc.). Not only will you build trust with the team, but you will also remove the need to "communicate" (as in, filtering and processing information), which is a typical management task.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, many of these practices do not scale past 20-25 engineers, but that's part of the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you found this post actionable, good luck with building your team!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How a 40-Line Fix Eliminated a 400x Performance Gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a habit of skimming the OpenJDK commit log every few weeks. Many commits are too complex for me to grasp in the limited time I have reserved for this ... special hobby. But occasionally something catches my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, this commit stopped me mid-scroll:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;858d2e434dd 8372584: [Linux]: Replace reading proc to get thread CPUtime with clock_gettime&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diffstat was interesting: &lt;code&gt;+96 insertions, -54 deletions&lt;/code&gt;. The changeset adds a 55-line JMH benchmark, which means the production code itself is actually reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Deleted Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what got removed from &lt;code&gt;os_linux.cpp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {pid_t tid = thread-&amp;gt;osthread()-&amp;gt;thread_id();char *s;char stat[2048];size_t statlen;char proc_name[64];int count;long sys_time, user_time;char cdummy;int idummy;long ldummy;FILE *fp;os::snprintf_checked(proc_name, 64, "/proc/self/task/%d/stat", tid);fp = os::fopen(proc_name, "r");if (fp == nullptr) return -1;statlen = fread(stat, 1, 2047, fp);stat[statlen] = '\0';fclose(fp);// Skip pid and the command string. Note that we could be dealing with// weird command names, e.g. user could decide to rename java launcher// to "java 1.4.2 :)", then the stat file would look like// 1234 (java 1.4.2 :)) R ... ...// We don't really need to know the command string, just find the last// occurrence of ")" and then start parsing from there. See bug 4726580.s = strrchr(stat, ')');if (s == nullptr) return -1;// Skip blank charsdo { s++; } while (s &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isspace((unsigned char) *s));count = sscanf(s,"%c %d %d %d %d %d %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu",&amp;amp;cdummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy, &amp;amp;idummy,&amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy, &amp;amp;ldummy,&amp;amp;user_time, &amp;amp;sys_time);if (count != 13) return -1;return (jlong)user_time * (1000000000 / os::Posix::clock_tics_per_second());}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the implementation behind &lt;code&gt;ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt;. To get the current thread's user CPU time, the old code was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Formatting a path to &lt;code&gt;/proc/self/task/&amp;lt;tid&amp;gt;/stat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Opening that file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading into a stack buffer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parsing through a hostile format where the command name can contain parentheses (hence the &lt;code&gt;strrchr&lt;/code&gt;for the last&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;sscanf&lt;/code&gt;to extract fields 13 and 14&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Converting clock ticks to nanoseconds&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, here's what &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadCpuTime()&lt;/code&gt; does and has always done:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time() {return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);}jlong os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid_t clockid) {struct timespec tp;clock_gettime(clockid, &amp;amp;tp);return (jlong)(tp.tv_sec * NANOSECS_PER_SEC + tp.tv_nsec);}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a single &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; call. There is no file I/O, no complex parsing and no buffer to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Performance Gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original bug report, filed back in 2018, quantified the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"getCurrentThreadUserTime is 30x-400x slower than getCurrentThreadCpuTime"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gap widens under concurrency. Why is &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; so much faster? Both approaches require kernel entry, but the difference is in what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;syscall&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VFS dispatch + dentry lookup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;procfs synthesizes file content at read time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kernel formats string into buffer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;syscall, copy to userspace&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;userspace &lt;code&gt;sscanf()&lt;/code&gt;parsing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt;syscall&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID)&lt;/code&gt; path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;single syscall → &lt;code&gt;posix_cpu_clock_get()&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_sample()&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;task_sched_runtime()&lt;/code&gt;→ reads directly from&lt;code&gt;sched_entity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; path involves multiple syscalls, VFS machinery, string formatting kernel-side, and parsing userspace-side. The &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; path is one syscall with a direct function call chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under concurrent load, the &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; approach also suffers from kernel lock contention. The bug report notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Reading proc is slow (hence why this procedure is put under the method slow_thread_cpu_time(...)) and may lead to noticeable spikes in case of contention for kernel resources."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Two Implementations?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why didn't &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt; just use &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; from the start?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is (probably) POSIX. The standard mandates that &lt;code&gt;CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID&lt;/code&gt; returns total CPU time (user + system). There's no portable way to request user time only. Hence the &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;-based implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux port of OpenJDK isn't limited to what POSIX defines, it can use Linux-specific features. Let's see how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Clockid Bit Hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux kernels since 2.6.12 (released in 2005) encode clock type information directly into the &lt;code&gt;clockid_t&lt;/code&gt; value. When you call &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;, you get back a clockid with a specific bit pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Bit 2: Thread vs process clockBits 1-0: Clock type00 = PROF01 = VIRT (user time only)10 = SCHED (user + system, POSIX-compliant)11 = FD&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining bits encode the target PID/TID. We’ll come back to that in the bonus section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The POSIX-compliant &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt; returns a clockid with bits &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; (SCHED). But if you flip those low bits to &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; (VIRT), &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt; will return user time only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static bool get_thread_clockid(Thread* thread, clockid_t* clockid, bool total) {constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_TYPE_MASK = 3;constexpr clockid_t CPUCLOCK_VIRT = 1;int rc = pthread_getcpuclockid(thread-&amp;gt;osthread()-&amp;gt;pthread_id(), clockid);if (rc != 0) {// Thread may have terminatedassert_status(rc == ESRCH, rc, "pthread_getcpuclockid failed");return false;}if (!total) {// Flip to CPUCLOCK_VIRT for user-time-only*clockid = (*clockid &amp;amp; ~CLOCK_TYPE_MASK) | CPUCLOCK_VIRT;}return true;}static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {clockid_t clockid;bool success = get_thread_clockid(thread, &amp;amp;clockid, false);return success ? os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid) : -1;}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it. The new version has no file I/O, no buffer and certainly no &lt;code&gt;sscanf()&lt;/code&gt; with thirteen format specifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Profiling time!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at how it performs in practice. For this exercise, I am taking the JMH test included in the fix, the only change is that I increased the number of threads from 1 to 16 and added a &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method for simple execution from an IDE:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;@State(Scope.Benchmark)@Warmup(iterations = 2, time = 5)@Measurement(iterations = 5, time = 5)@BenchmarkMode(Mode.SampleTime)@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS)@Threads(16)@Fork(value = 1)public class ThreadMXBeanBench {static final ThreadMXBean mxThreadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();static long user; // To avoid dead-code elimination@Benchmarkpublic void getCurrentThreadUserTime() throws Throwable {user = mxThreadBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime();}public static void main(String[] args) throws RunnerException {Options opt = new OptionsBuilder().include(ThreadMXBeanBench.class.getSimpleName()).build();new Runner(opt).run();}}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Aside: This is a rather unscientific benchmark, I have other processes running on my desktop etc. Anyway, here is the setup: Ryzen 9950X, JDK main branch at commit 8ab7d3b89f656e5c. For the "before" case, I reverted the fix rather than checking out an older revision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Benchmark Mode Cnt Score Error UnitsThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime sample 8912714 11.186 ± 0.006 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00 sample 2.000 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50 sample 10.272 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90 sample 17.984 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95 sample 20.832 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99 sample 27.552 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999 sample 56.768 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999 sample 79.709 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00 sample 1179.648 us/op&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that a single invocation took 11 microseconds on average and the median was about 10 microseconds per invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU profile looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU profile confirms that each invocation of &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt; does multiple syscalls. In fact, most of the CPU time
is spent in syscalls. We can see files being opened and closed. Closing alone results in multiple syscalls, including futex locks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's see the benchmark result with the fix applied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Benchmark Mode Cnt Score Error UnitsThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime sample 11037102 0.279 ± 0.001 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00 sample 0.070 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50 sample 0.310 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90 sample 0.440 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95 sample 0.530 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99 sample 0.610 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999 sample 1.030 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999 sample 3.088 us/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00 sample 1230.848 us/op&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average went down from 11 microseconds to 279 nanos. This means the latency of the fixed version is 40x lower than the old version. While this is not a 400x improvement, it's within the 30x - 400x range from the original report. Chances are the delta would be higher with a different setup. Let's have a look at the new profile:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The profile is much cleaner. There is just a single syscall. If the profile is to be trusted then most of the time is spent in JVM, outside of the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Documented Is This?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barely. The bit encoding is stable. It hasn't changed in 20 years, but you won't find it in the &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime(2)&lt;/code&gt; man page.
The closest thing to official documentation is the kernel source itself, in &lt;code&gt;kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;CPUCLOCK_*&lt;/code&gt; macros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel's policy is clear: don't break userspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My take: If glibc depends on it, it's not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pushing Further&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When looking at profiler data from the 'after' run, I spotted a further optimization opportunity: A good portion of the remaining syscall is spent inside a radix tree lookup. Have a look:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the JVM calls &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;, it receives a &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; that encodes the thread's ID. When this &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; is passed to &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt;,
the kernel extracts the thread ID and performs a radix tree lookup to find the &lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt; structure associated with that ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the Linux kernel has a fast-path. If the encoded PID in the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; is 0, the kernel interprets this as "the current thread" and skips the radix tree lookup entirely, jumping to the current task's structure directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenJDK fix currently obtains the specific TID, flips the bits, and passes it to &lt;code&gt;clock_gettime()&lt;/code&gt;. This forces the kernel to take the "generalized path" (the radix tree lookup).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;/** Functions for validating access to tasks.*/static struct pid *pid_for_clock(const clockid_t clock, bool gettime){[...]/** If the encoded PID is 0, then the timer is targeted at current* or the process to which current belongs.*/if (upid == 0)// the fast path: current task lookup, cheapreturn thread ? task_pid(current) : task_tgid(current);// the generalized path: radix tree lookup, more expensivepid = find_vpid(upid);[...]&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the JVM constructed the entire &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; manually with PID=0 encoded (rather than obtaining the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;), the kernel could take the fast-path and avoid the radix tree lookup altogether.
The JVM already pokes bits in the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt;, so constructing it entirely from scratch wouldn't be a bigger leap compatibility-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's try it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a refresher on the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; encoding. The &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; is constructed like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;clockid for TID=42, user-time-only:1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1110_1010_1101└───────────────~42────────────────┘│└┘│ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)└─── 1 = per-thread&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the current thread, we want PID=0 encoded, which gives &lt;code&gt;~0&lt;/code&gt; in the upper bits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1101└─────────────── ~0 ───────────────┘│└┘│ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)└─── 1 = per-thread&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can translate this into C++ as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;// Linux Kernel internal bit encoding for dynamic CPU clocks:// [31:3] : Bitwise NOT of the PID or TID (~0 for current thread)// [2] : 1 = Per-thread clock, 0 = Per-process clock// [1:0] : Clock type (0 = PROF, 1 = VIRT/User-only, 2 = SCHED)static_assert(sizeof(clockid_t) == 4, "Linux clockid_t must be 32-bit");constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME = static_cast&amp;lt;clockid_t&amp;gt;(~0u &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3 | 4 | 1);&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then make a tiny teensy change to &lt;code&gt;user_thread_cpu_time()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time(bool user_sys_cpu_time) {if (user_sys_cpu_time) {return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);} else {- return user_thread_cpu_time(Thread::current());+ return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME);}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change above is sufficient to make &lt;code&gt;getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt; use the fast-path in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that we are in nanoseconds territory already, we tweak the test a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Increase the iteration and fork count&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use just a single thread to minimize noise&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switch to nanos&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The benchmark changes are meant to eliminate noise from the rest of my system and get a more precise measurement of the small delta we expect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;@State(Scope.Benchmark)@Warmup(iterations = 4, time = 5)@Measurement(iterations = 10, time = 5)@BenchmarkMode(Mode.SampleTime)@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)@Threads(1)@Fork(value = 3)public class ThreadMXBeanBench {static final ThreadMXBean mxThreadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();static long user; // To avoid dead-code elimination@Benchmarkpublic void getCurrentThreadUserTime() throws Throwable {user = mxThreadBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime();}public static void main(String[] args) throws RunnerException {Options opt = new OptionsBuilder().include(ThreadMXBeanBench.class.getSimpleName()).build();new Runner(opt).run();}}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The version currently in JDK main branch gives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Benchmark Mode Cnt Score Error UnitsThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime sample 4347067 81.746 ± 0.510 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00 sample 69.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50 sample 80.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90 sample 90.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95 sample 90.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99 sample 90.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999 sample 230.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999 sample 1980.000 ns/opThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00 sample 653312.000 ns/op&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The average went down from 81.7 ns to 70.8 ns, so about a 13% improvement. The improvements are visible across all percentiles as well. Is it worth the loss of clarity from constructing the &lt;code&gt;clockid&lt;/code&gt; manually rather than using &lt;code&gt;pthread_getcpuclockid()&lt;/code&gt;?
I am not entirely sure. The absolute gain is small and makes additional assumptions about kernel internals, including the size of &lt;code&gt;clockid_t&lt;/code&gt;. On the other hand, it's still a gain without any downside in practice. (famous last words...)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Browsing for Gems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I like browsing commits of large open source projects. A 40-line deletion eliminated a 400x performance gap. The fix required no new kernel features, just knowledge of a stable-but-obscure Linux ABI detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the kernel source. POSIX tells you what's portable. The kernel source code tells you what's possible. Sometimes there's a 400x difference between the two. Whether it is worth exploiting is a different question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check the old assumptions. The &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; parsing approach made sense when it was written, before anyone realized it could be exploited this way. Assumptions get baked into code. Revisiting them occasionally pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change landed on December 3, 2025. Just one day before the JDK 26 feature freeze. If you're using &lt;code&gt;ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()&lt;/code&gt;, JDK 26 (releasing March 2026) brings you a free 30-400x speedup!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Update: Jonas Norlinder (the patch author) shared his own deep-dive in the Hacker News discussion - written independently around the same time. Great minds! His is more rigorous on the memory overhead side; mine digs deeper into the bit encoding and the PID=0 fast-path.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I posted some tips on how to present a new* programming language to HN: &lt;/p&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46608577&lt;p&gt;. It occurred to me that HN has a tradition of posts called "The {name} programming language" (part of the long tradition of papers and books with such titles) and it might be fun to track them down. I tried to keep only the interesting ones:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/thelang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Show HNs of programming languages are at https://news.ycombinator.com/showlang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are curated lists so they're frozen in time. Maybe we can figure out how to update them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few famous cases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Go Programming Language - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=934142 - Nov 2009 (219 comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rust programming language - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1498528 - July 2010 (44 comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Julia Programming Language - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606380 - Feb 2012 (203 comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swift Programming Language - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7835099 - June 2014 (926 comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the obscure and esoteric ones are the most fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(* where 'new' might mean old, of course - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23459210)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Who?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are Sei, an agentic AI platform for financial services. Since launching, we're live with large enterprises across the US, Europe, and APAC and growing at double digits per month.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are backed by world-class investors, including Y Combinator, Tribe Capital, PayPal, Picus Capital, &amp;amp; Hashed. Pranay (CEO) and Ram (CTO) are the founders. We have a combined 20+ years of experience building fintech and tech products for businesses &amp;amp; customers worldwide at companies such as Deutsche Bank, Cloud Kitchens, PayPal, TransferWise, and Amazon, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are looking for a devops engineer who will help shape the tech, product, and culture of the company. We are currently working with a bunch of enterprise customers and banks and are experiencing rapid growth. We are looking to hire very senior engineers who can take our V1 into a more scaleable, robust platform as we prepare for more growth.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What to expect&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The tech stack looks like the below:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Typescript backend and React frontend&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Python for AI agents&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Infrastructure deployed on AWS with Terraform (Kubernetes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You can expect to do all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Auto-scale our platform and correct-size components to optimise for costs&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Manage and scale open source monitoring tools&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Integrate open source security tooling&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Manage and scale webRTC servers, PSTN gateways and switches, STT/TTS/LLM deployments, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Our values&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Continuous 360 feedback: Everyone is expected to share constructive, critical feedback with everyone else, including the founders.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Product-minded: Everyone shares product ownership, so we expect everyone to engage in customer outreach, support, and customer conversations to gather feedback and identify new features.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Doers over talkers: We spend time figuring out the right direction, then execute quickly. No one is too “senior” to do a job - the CTO will code every day, the CEO will sell every day, and everyone takes care of customer support on a schedule. We understand the difference between real work and pretense.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Humanity over everything else: We sell the product to businesses, but in reality, we sell it to real humans on the other side. Our end customers are consumers using the product through our UI or integrated with our APIs, so we are building the world’s most human-centric company (no pun intended). Kindness is expected, and empathy is the core value we’re looking for.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;About you&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We expect you to have built things from 0 to 1 or 1 to 10 (which is typically an early or growth stage startup)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Strong platform and devops experience (especially AWS, k8s, Terraform, etc.) is mandatory. Exposure to AI/ML and LLMs is mandatory. You should have written prompts, used AI tools for coding, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We don’t read much into your CV; instead, we look at what you have done in your life so far (side projects, open-source contributions, blogs, etc.). We don’t care about degrees, the institutions you went to, or the companies you worked for before. We are open to talking as long as you have put in the reps, good judgment, clarity, align with our values, and have a strong track record of thoughtful work.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We expect you to have an extremely strong bias toward action, strong motivation, side projects, and to have built and/or scaled systems from scratch.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pay and benefits: We offer a solid, competitive package (including early-stage equity). We give you the flexibility to choose the split between cash and equity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why you should not join&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you want to coast along and do the minimal possible work. The work hours will be intense - we believe in less micro-management and high accountability. It takes a lot of sweat to get a startup off the ground, and you will let the team down if you don’t pull your socks up.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you cannot do intense work every day (with exceptions, of course). The above point talks about the sheer quantity of the work, but this one is more about the quality. We have intentionally kept meetings to a bare minimum, so people can get into their zones and be productive. But if this distracts you and you end up doing half-assed work, then we might not be the right fit for you.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you have low ambition. We believe in hiring ambitious and hard-working folks who will never take &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt; for an answer. We also hire people with strong intrinsic motivation. People who have succeeded so far are the ones who can run with things even without structure and work hard even when no one is watching. People we have had to let go have had issues with motivation, needed babysitting, do fake work to get standup updates out, and cannot handle feedback.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you are not easy-going with the team. We have hired a team of people who are friendly and help each other out. There is zero attitude in the team. We sometimes have conflicting opinions on how things should be done, but at the end of the day we disagree and still commit to doing what moves the company forward.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;If you cannot be with us in our Gurgaon office (Sector 54, Golf Course Rd) or Chennai office (T.Nagar) at least 4 days a week.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;

Though it has been played by adults in organized groups worldwide, 1000 Blank White Cards is also described as well-suited for children in Hoyle's Rules of Games.[1] Since any game rules are contained on the cards (rather than existing as all-encompassing rules or in a rule book), 1000 Blank White Cards can be considered a sort of nomic. It can be played by any number of players and provides the opportunity for card creation and gameplay outside the scope of a single sitting. Creating new cards during the game, dealing with previous cards' effects, is allowed, and rule modification is encouraged as an integral part of gameplay.[1][2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Game&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The game consists of whatever the players define it as by creating and playing things. There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many typical players, though, the game may be split into three logical parts: the deck creation, the play itself, and the epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deck creation&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;A deck of cards consists of any number of cards, generally of a uniform size and of rigid enough paper stock that they may be reused. Some may bear artwork, writing or other game-relevant content created during past games, with a reasonable stock of cards that are blank at the start of gameplay. Some time may be taken to create cards before gameplay commences, although card creation may be more dynamic if no advance preparation is made, and it is suggested that the game be simply sprung upon a group of players, who may or may not have any idea what they are being caught up in. If the game has been played before, all past cards can be used in gameplay unless the game specifies otherwise, but perhaps not until the game has allowed them into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical group's conventions for deck creation follow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though cards are created at all times throughout the game (except the epilogue), it is necessary to start with at least some cards pre-made. Despite the name of the game, a deck of 80 to 150 cards is usual, depending on the desired duration of the game, and of these approximately half will be created before the start of play. If a group doesn't already possess a partial deck they may choose to start with fewer cards and to create most of the deck during play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the group possesses a deck already (from previous games), they will usually want to add a few more cards, so the first phase of the game involves each player creating six or seven new cards to add to the deck. See structure of a card below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the deck is ready, all of the cards (including blanks) are shuffled together and each player is dealt five cards. The remainder of the deck is placed in the centre of the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Play&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The rules of game are determined as the game is played. There exists no fixed order of play or limit to the length or scope of the game. Such parameters may be set within the game but are of course subject to alteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sample convention suggests the following:[citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play proceeds clockwise beginning with the player on the dealer's left. On each player's turn, he/she draws a card from the central deck and then plays a card from his/her hand. Cards can be played to any player (including the person playing the card), or to the table (so that it affects everyone). Cards with lasting effects, such as awarding points or changing the game's rules, are kept on the table to remind players of those effects. Cards with no lasting effects, or cards that have been nullified, are placed in a discard pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blank cards can be made into playable cards at any time simply by drawing on them (see structure of a card).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play continues until there are no cards left in the central deck and no one can play (if they have no cards that can be played in the current situation). The "winner" is the player with the highest score of total points at the end of the game, though in some games points don't actually matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Since the cards created in any game may be used as the beginning of a deck for a future game, many players like to reduce the deck to a collection of their favourites. The epilogue is simply an opportunity for the players to collectively decide which cards to keep and which to discard (or set aside as not-for-play).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many players believe that having their own cards favoured during the epilogue is the true "victory" of 1000 Blank White Cards, although the game's creator has never discarded or destroyed a card unless that action was specified within the scope of the game. Retaining and replaying those cards which seem at the moment less than perfect can help reduce a certain stagnation and tendency to over-think that can otherwise overtake the game's momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One group of players in Boston (not the long-dispersed Harvard cadre) have introduced the idea of the "Suck Box":&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't like to destroy cards, even if they suck, so we have a notecard box called The Suck Box. If a player feels a card is boring and useless to gameplay, they will nominate it for admission to The Suck Box. All players present then vote (sometimes lobbying for their cases), and the card either goes into The Suck Box or gets to remain in the primary deck. Ironically, when The Suck Box was introduced, one player created a card for the express purpose of adding it to The Suck Box. However, the rest of us felt that it was too amusing a card and had to remain in the deck.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Structure of a card&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;At its simplest, a card is just that: a physical card, which may or may not have undergone any modifications. Its role in the game is both as itself and as whatever information it carries, which can be changed, erased or amended. The cards used vary widely in size, from the original 1+1⁄2-by-3+1⁄2-inch (3.8 cm × 8.9 cm) Vis-Ed brand flash cards, to half or full index cards, to simply sheets of A7 sized paper. Cards may be created with any marking medium and need not conform to any conventions of size or content unless specified within the scope of the game. Cards have been made of a wide range of substances, and modifying the shape or composition of a card is entirely acceptable: the original Vis-Ed box still contains a card, created by Plan 9 From Bell Labs developer Mycroftiv, to which a tablet of zinc has been affixed with adhesive tape; the card reads "Eat This!... In a few minutes, the ZINC will be entering your system."[2] Many cards have been created which demanded their own modification, destruction or duplication, and many have been created which display nothing but a picture or text bearing no explicit significance whatsoever. Some have been eaten, burned, or cut and folded into other shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game does tend to fall into structural conventions, of which the following is a good example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A card consists (usually) of a title, a picture and a description of its effect. The title should uniquely identify the card. The picture can be as simple as a stick figure, or as complex as the player likes. The description, or rule, is the part that affects the game. It can award or deny points, cause a player to miss a turn, change the direction of play, or do anything the player can think of. The rules written on cards in play make up the majority of the game's total ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these conventions can generate rather monotonous decks of one panel cartoons bearing point values, rules or both. As conceived, the game is far broader, as it is not inherently limited in length or scope, is radically self-modifying, and can contain references to, or actual instances of, other games or activities. The game can also encode algorithms (trivially functioning as a Turing machine), store real-world data, and hold or refer to non-card objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;History&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The game was originally created late in 1995 by Nathan McQuillen of Madison, Wisconsin.[2][4] He was inspired by seeing a product at a local coffeehouse: a box of 1000 Vis-Ed brand blank white flash cards.[2] He introduced "The game of 1000 blank white cards" a few days later into a mixed group including students, improvisational theatre members and club kids. Initial play sessions were frequent and high energy, but a fire consumed the regular venue shortly after the game's introduction.[5] The game physically survived but with the loss of their regular meeting place the majority of the original players fell out of contact with one another, and soon most had moved on to other cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game started to spread as a meme through various social networks, mostly collegiate, in the late 1990s. Aaron Mandel, a former Madison resident, brought the game to Harvard University and started an active playgroup which changed the size of the cards to the more standard half-index dimensions (2+1⁄2 by 3+1⁄2 inches [6.4 cm × 8.9 cm]). Boston players Dave Packer and Stewart King created the first web content representing the game.[2] Their graduation served to further spread the game to the west coast and onto the web. Subsequently, an article in GAMES Magazine and inclusion in the 2001 revision of Hoyle's Rules of Games[1] established the game as an independent part of gaming culture. Various celebrities have also contributed cards to the game, including musicians Ben Folds and Jonatha Brooke, and cartoonist Bill Plympton.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game's inventor and its original players have frequently expressed amusement at the spread of a game they regarded mostly as a brilliant but highly idiosyncratic bit of conceptual humor which provided them with an excuse to draw goofy cartoons.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b c Hoyle's Rules of Games, Third Revised and Updated Edition, in material revised by Philip D.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rails 8, the latest release of the popular web application framework based on Ruby, excised Redis from its standard technology stack. Redis is no longer required to queue jobs, cache partials and data, and send real-time messages. Instead, Rails’s new features—SolidQueue for job queuing, SolidCache for caching, and SolidCable for transiting ActionCable messages—run entirely on your application’s existing relational database service. For most Rails applications, Redis can be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know how that sounds. The Redis key-value store is fast, adept, and robust, and its reliability made it the preferred infrastructure for Rails job queueing and caching for more than a decade. Countless applications depend on Redis every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Redis does add complexity. SolidQueue, SolidCache, and SolidCable sparked something of an epiphany for me: boring technology such as relational database tables can be just as capable as a specialized solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, let’s examine the true cost of running Redis, discover how SolidQueue works and supplants a key-value store, and learn how to use SolidQueue to migrate an application’s job queues to vanilla PostgreSQL (or SQLite or MySQL). Web development is already too complicated—let’s simplify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The True Cost of Redis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does Redis cost beyond its monthly hosting bill? Setup and ongoing maintenance are not free. To use Redis you must:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deploy, version, patch, and monitor the server software&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure a persistence strategy. Do you choose RDB snapshots, AOF logs, or both?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set and watch memory limits and establish eviction policies&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to those taxes, there are other ongoing burdens to infrastructure and interoperability. You must also:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sustain network connectivity, including firewall rules, between Rails and Redis&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Authenticate your Redis clients&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build and care for a high availability (HA) Redis cluster&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Orchestrate the lifecycles of Sidekiq processes across deployments&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, when something goes wrong with a job, you’re faced with debugging Redis and your RDBMS, two data stores with very different semantics, switching context between different query languages and tools. And then there’s the issue of two separate backup strategies. (You tested them both, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a “Redis-less” Rails stack, things are simpler. If Rails or PostgreSQL fails, everything stops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How SolidQueue Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis is a very different data store than PostgreSQL. In many ways, Redis is treated as if it’s memory: atomic, volatile, and very fast. So how does SolidQueue manage to replace it with PostgreSQL?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 9.5 enhanced its SQL &lt;code&gt;FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; clause to add  &lt;code&gt;SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;FOR UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; clause creates an exclusive row lock. &lt;code&gt;SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt; further skips any rows currently locked. This mechanism makes running database-backed job queues viable, even at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what happens when a worker needs a job:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
SELECT * FROM solid_queue_ready_executions
WHERE queue_name = 'default'
ORDER BY priority DESC, job_id ASC
LIMIT 1
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A free worker always picks up the next available job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This database optimization solves the fundamental problem that plagued earlier database queue implementations: lock contention. A worker never waits for another and a worker never blocks. Multiple workers can query simultaneously and PostgreSQL guarantees each claims a unique job. When a worker finishes processing, it releases the lock and deletes the execution record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SolidQueue architecture centers on three tables:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All jobs are stored in &lt;code&gt;solid_queue_jobs&lt;/code&gt;. The table persists job metadata, such as the name of the job, its Ruby class, and timestamps to record when the job started and finished. By default, every queueing request is recorded in this table and retained permanently, even after the job completes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A scheduled job waits in &lt;code&gt;solid_queue_scheduled_executions&lt;/code&gt;until its scheduled time arrives.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A job ready to run immediately is queued to solid_queue_ready_executions, where a worker claims it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job tables can churn rapidly and steadily (there are hordes of inserts and deletes), but PostgreSQL’s MVCC design handles this fine with its built-in autovacuum process. No special tuning required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A handful of processes coordinate this flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Workers poll &lt;code&gt;solid_queue_ready_executions&lt;/code&gt;at configurable intervals (as fast as 0.1 seconds for high-priority queue/se&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jobs are claimed and subsequently executed with &lt;code&gt;FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED&lt;/code&gt;to control concurrency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dispatchers poll &lt;code&gt;solid_queue_scheduled_executions&lt;/code&gt;once per second, moving due jobs into the ready table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Schedulers manage recurring tasks by enqueueing jobs per defined timetables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A supervisor process monitors all these, tracking heartbeats and restarting crashed processes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These separate concerns may be SolidQueue’s most elegant feature. Each process type operates on different tables with different polling intervals optimized for its workload. The processes never interfere with each other, and the database handles all coordination through vanilla transactional database semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scheduling Recurring Jobs with SolidQueue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recurring jobs add to the costs inherent with Redis, as you often must integrate yet another library to schedule regular jobs. For example, assuming an application uses Sidekiq for its ActiveJob adapter, sidekiq-cron and whenever are two popular solutions to schedule repetitive jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing supplemental is required; however, if you use SolidQueue. It includes cron-style recurring jobs out of the box. Simply edit config/recurring.yml. The configuration file should look hauntingly familiar:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
# config/recurring.yml
production:

  cleanup_old_sessions:
    class: CleanupSessionsJob
    schedule: every day at 2am
    queue: maintenance

  send_daily_digest:
    class: DailyDigestJob
    schedule: every day at 9am
    queue: mailers

  refresh_cache:
    class: CacheWarmupJob
    schedule: every hour
    queue: default&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how SolidQueue’s recurring jobs work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the scheduler runs it finds the jobs due and enqueues each job to run. In the list above, for example, the task refresh_cache causes CacheWarmupJob to run at the top of each hour.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Concurrently, the scheduler also queues a new job to run at the time of the next occurrence in the series. Continuing the example, an hourly task that runs at 8:00 AM schedules itself to run again at 9:00 AM.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The 9:00 AM task schedules itself for 10:00 AM, ad infinitum.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is borrowed from GoodJob, another database-backed queue system. It’s crash-resistant because schedules are deterministic. “Every hour” always resolves to the top of the hour, regardless of when the scheduler process starts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want more detail on everything SolidQueue is doing under the hood, Hans-Jörg Schnedlitz over at AppSignal gives a really thorough treatment of all its pulleys and belts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Job Concurrency: The Feature You Didn’t Know You Needed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve historically used Rails at mere mortal scale, you may be unaware that Sidekiq also offers concurrency limits as a paid feature in Sidekiq Enterprise. If you’re considering using Sidekiq, concurrency limiting alone is worth the additional expense for the Enterprise edition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But SolidQueue gives you this, and more, for free! Simply add &lt;code&gt;limits_concurrency&lt;/code&gt; to any job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class ProcessUserOnboardingJob &amp;lt; ApplicationJob
  limits_concurrency to: 1, 
    key: -&amp;gt;(user) { user.id }, 
    duration: 15.minutes

def perform(user)&amp;lt;
    # Complex onboarding workflow
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;limits_concurrency to: 1&lt;/code&gt; ensures only one &lt;code&gt;ProcessUserOnboardingJob&lt;/code&gt; job runs per user at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;duration&lt;/code&gt; parameter is also essential, as it defines how long SolidQueue guarantees the concurrency limit. If a job crashes, say, the semaphore eventually expires, preventing deadlocks caused by crashed workers that never release their locks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implementation uses two tables: &lt;code&gt;solid_queue_semaphores&lt;/code&gt; to track concurrency limits and &lt;code&gt;solid_queue_blocked_executions&lt;/code&gt; to hold jobs waiting for semaphore release. When a job finishes, it releases its semaphore and triggers a dispatcher to unblock the next waiting job. It’s elegant, database-native, and requires zero external coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Monitor SolidQueue with Mission Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The no-fee version of Sidekiq’s web user interface is okay. Sidekiq Pro ($949/year) and Sidekiq Enterprise (starting at $1,699/year) offer enhanced dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mission Control Jobs is free, open source, and designed specifically for Rails 8’s SolidQueue ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# config/routes.rb
mount MissionControl::Jobs::Engine, at: "/jobs"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this single line in your routes, you now have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Real-time” job status across all queues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Failed job inspection with full stack traces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retry and discard controls with batch operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scheduled job timeline visualization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recurring job management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Queue-specific metrics and throughput graphs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even better, Mission Control can inspect your database schema. When you inspect a failed job, you can see its job arguments (just like Sidekiq), but you can also query the job data with everyone’s favorite query language, SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT j.queue_name, COUNT(*) as failed_count
FROM solid_queue_failed_executions fe
JOIN solid_queue_jobs j ON j.id = fe.job_id
WHERE fe.created_at &amp;gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY j.queue_name;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQL is a language you already know running in tools you already use. No external parsing. No timestamp arithmetic. Just SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Migration Path: From Sidekiq to SolidQueue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s almost trivial to migrate from Sidekiq to SolidQueue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 1: Change the Rails queue adapter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rails’s queue adapter setting specifies which queuing backend is used for processing background jobs asynchronously. Set it to &lt;code&gt;:solid_queue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# config/environments/production.rb
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 2: Install SolidQueue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SolidQueue gem must be installed separately from Rails. The gem includes two tasks to add SolidQueue’s tables to the application’s database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ bundle add solid_queue
$ rails solid_queue:install
$ rails db:migrate
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 3: Replace sidekiq-cron schedules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming you are using Sidekiq, convert your config/sidekiq.yml cron schedules to config/recurring.yml. The config is similarly shaped, but you’ll need to update key names and convert classic cron strings to Fugit’s preferred natural language:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# OLD: config/sidekiq.yml
:schedule:
  cleanup_job:
    cron: '0 2 * * *'
    class: CleanupJob
# NEW: config/recurring.yml
production:
  cleanup_job:
    class: CleanupJob
    schedule: every day at 2am&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 4: Update your Procfile&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Procfile enumerates the processes to launch on application start. To kick off SolidQueue, add the task &lt;code&gt;solid_queue:start&lt;/code&gt; (replacing Sidekiq, say).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
jobs: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 5: Blast the old stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis and Sidekiq are now obsolete. You can remove any corresponding gems from the Gemfile. Run Bundler to remove the dependencies from Gemfile.lock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Gemfile - DELETE
# gem "redis"&amp;lt;
# gem "sidekiq"
# gem "sidekiq-cron"

$ bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle clean --force
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your existing ActiveJob jobs work without modification. All retry strategies, error handling, and job options transfer directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When NOT To Use SolidQueue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some applications need Redis. Here are some candidates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You’re processing thousands of jobs per second sustained (not spikes, but consistent, sustained load).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Job latency under 1ms is critical to your business. This is a real and pressing concern for real-time bidding, high frequency trading (HFT), and other applications in the same ilk.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You have complex pub/sub patterns across multiple services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You require intensive rate limiting or counters that benefit from Redis’s atomic operations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a benchmark, Shopify engineer John Duff presented some numbers at Big Ruby 2013: 833 requests/second, 72ms average response time, 53 servers with 1,172 worker processes. At that scale—twelve years ago—Shopify needed Redis-level infrastructure. Are you there yet?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You definitely do not need Redis if processing is less than 100 jobs/second or job latency tolerance is greater than 100ms. You may need Redis if processing 100-1000 jobs/second (test both, measure), traffic is spiky, (Black Friday sales, ticket releases), or sub-100ms job queue latency is required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Practical Implementation Guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s walk through a real-world setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 1: Generate a New Rails 8 App&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ rails new myapp --database=postgresql
$ cd myapp&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rails 8 auto-configures SolidQueue, SolidCache, and SolidCable. You’re halfway done already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 2: Set Up Queue Database&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SolidQueue needs to know where to store its tables. The recommended approach is a separate database connection (even if it’s the same physical database server).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update your config/database.yml:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;development:
  primary: &amp;amp;primary_development
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;: *default
    database: myapp_development
  queue:
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;: *primary_development
   database: myapp_queue_development
    migrations_paths: db/queue_migrate
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using SQLite or MySQL, the official SolidQueue documentation has examples for those setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now tell SolidQueue to use its own connection in config/environments/development.rb:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Rails.application.configure do
  config.active_job.queue_adapter = :solid_queue
  config.solid_queue.connects_to = { database: { writing: :queue } }
end&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run db:prepare and Rails handles everything automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ rails db:prepare&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rails creates the queue database and loads the schema. No custom rake tasks needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 3: Configure Mission Control Authentication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# config/environments/development.rb (add to existing config block)
config.mission_control.jobs.http_basic_auth_user = "dev"
config.mission_control.jobs.http_basic_auth_password = "dev"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 4: Mount Mission Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# config/routes.rb
mount MissionControl::Jobs::Engine, at: "/jobs"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 5: Create Procfile.dev&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;web: bin/rails server
jobs: bundle exec rake solid_queue:start&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Step 6: Start Everything&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Start all the servers for Rails from the shell
$ bin/dev&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Test SolidQueue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a test job, enqueue it, and watch it in Mission Control:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Generate a new job class from the shell
$ rails generate job EmailReport&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open the new Ruby file and add this code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Job definition
class EmailReportJob &amp;lt; ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default
  retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 5
  def perform(user_id)
    user = User.find(user_id)
    ReportMailer.weekly_summary(user).deliver_now
  end
end&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, run the Rails console and queue an immediate job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;console&amp;gt; EmailReportJob.perform_later(User.first.id)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While in the console, queue a scheduled job, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;console&amp;gt; EmailReportJob
.set(wait:  1.week)
.perform_later(User.first.id)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make it recurring in config/recurring.yml:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;production:
  weekly_reports:&amp;lt;
    class: EmailReportJob
    schedule: every monday at 8am
    queue: mailers
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you might want to kick over your server and visit http://localhost:3000/jobs to admire your handiwork in Mission Control Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common Gotchas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Single Database Setup (Alternative)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SolidQueue recommends the use of a separate database connection, but you can run everything in one database, if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy the contents of db/queue_schema.rb into a regular migration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Delete db/queue_schema.rb&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remove config.solid_queue.connects_to from your environment configs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run rails db:migrate&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works fine for smaller apps, but at the cost of operational flexibility. The Rails team recommends the separate connection approach. See the official docs for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Mission Control in Production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to add authentication to limit access to Mission Control in production environments! The development example uses Basic Auth, but you’ll want something more robust for production:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# config/initializers/mission_control.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  config.mission_control.jobs.base_controller_class = 
    "AdminController"
end&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Polling Intervals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default polling interval is 1 second for scheduled jobs and 0.2 seconds for ready jobs. If you’re migrating from Sidekiq and notice jobs feel “slower,” check your expectations. In my experience, SolidQueue’s defaults work well for most applications. Sub-second latency usually doesn’t matter for background jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;ActionCable and Turbo Streams&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using ActionCable (or anything that depends on it like Turbo Streams), you’ll need to configure SolidCable with its own database connection too. Add a cable database to your database.yml:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# config/database.yml
production:
  primary:
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;: *default
    database: myapp_production
  cable:
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;: *default
    database: myapp_cable_production
    migrations_paths: db/cable_migrate&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then in config/cable.yml:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;production:
  adapter: solid_cable
  connects_to:
    database:
      writing: cable
  polling_interval: 0.1.seconds
  message_retention: 1.day&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Polling Interval&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The polling_interval of 0.1 seconds means your ActionCable server polls the database 10 times per second—light enough for PostgreSQL to handle without breaking a sweat. This gives you 100ms latency for real-time updates, which feels plenty snappy for Turbo Streams, live notifications, or even chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Does it Scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may be asking the timeless question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bUT doES iT ScALe?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is yes, it scales. A better question, though, is “Does it scale enough for me?” To answer, you can start with this lovely formula from Nate Berkopec’s 2015 article “Scaling Ruby Apps to 1000 RPM”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Required app instances = request rate (req/sec) × average response time (sec)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s do the math for a typical app. Say your app is getting 100 requests per minute, with a 200ms average response time. That’s ~1.67 requests per second. Multiply by 0.2 seconds and you get 0.083 application instances required. You need 8% of one application instance to handle your load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an anecdote, 37signals processes 20 million jobs per day. That’s roughly 230 jobs per second running all on PostgreSQL sans Redis. Unless you’re processing millions of jobs per day, PostgreSQL can handle your load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a side by side comparison of Redis and Sidekiq versus SolidQueue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Aspect&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Redis + Sidekiq&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SolidQueue&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Setup complexity&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Separate service + config&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Already there&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Query language&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Redis commands&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SQL&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Monitoring&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Separate dashboard&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Same as your app&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Failure modes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6+ distinct scenarios&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2 scenarios&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Job throughput&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~1000s/sec&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~200-300/sec&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Good enough for&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;99.9% of apps&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;95% of apps&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redis and Sidekiq are masterfully engineered and Rails applications have benefited immeasurably from the combination for over a decade. But for most Rails apps, Redis and Sidekiq solve a problem you don’t have at a cost you can’t afford.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give SolidQueue a spin. Your infrastructure simplifies, your operational burden lightens, and you can focus on building a product instead of maintaining a stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of these practices are still emerging in our community. If you have corrections, criticisms, or feedback, please reach out and let me know. I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Hate Github Actions with Passion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t overstate how much I hate GitHub Actions. I don’t even remember hating any other piece of technology I used. Sure, I still make fun of PHP that I remember from times of PHP41, but even then I didn’t hate it. Merely I found it subpar technology to other emerging at the time (like Ruby on Rails or Django). And yet I hate GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Passion2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Road to Hell&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day before writing these words I was implementing &lt;code&gt;build.rs&lt;/code&gt; for my tmplr project. To save you a click - it is a file/project scaffold tool with human readable (and craftable) template files. I (personally) use it very often, given how easy it is to craft new templates, by hand or with aid of the tool, so check it out if you need a similar tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;build.rs&lt;/code&gt; used &lt;code&gt;CUE&lt;/code&gt; to generate &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt; and also a version/help file to guarantee consistency. It was fun thing to do, it took approx. 1.5h and I even wrote an article about it. For myself and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was happy with the results and didn’t check CI output which, quite unsurprisingly, failed. I was using &lt;code&gt;cue&lt;/code&gt; binary inside &lt;code&gt;build.rs&lt;/code&gt; and without it build simply couldn’t progress. When I woke up next day and saw e-mail from CI notifying me about failed build I immediatelly knew my day isn’t going to start with puppies and rainbows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took couple attempts to search and push GitHub Action that would install &lt;code&gt;CUE&lt;/code&gt; and then I got the worst of the worst results: One system in matrix failing to build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A word of explanation. I’m building &lt;code&gt;tmplr&lt;/code&gt; for 4 platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux ARM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS ARM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux x86_64&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS x86_64&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Makes sense, right? Even though my user base can be counted on a fingers of one-arm-less and second-arm-hook-equipped pirate, it’s still a thing “One Should Do”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with all that - Linux ARM failed with “command can’t be found”. &lt;code&gt;CUE&lt;/code&gt; installed and ran nicely for all other 3 targets, but for some reason it failed for Linux ARM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you don’t care about why I hate GitHub but your mind started to wonder to “what went wrong” let me tell you; because I know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So supposedly cross build that happens in matrix is heavily isolated. When I install &lt;code&gt;CUE&lt;/code&gt; I install it only on x86_64 Linux host and macOS ARM host. macOS has zero issues running x86_64 binary and no issues are raised when Linux x86_64 tries to run x86_64 binary. But GitHub Actions is nice enough to hide x86_64 binary from arm64 runner, so that it won’t break.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you GitHub Actions. What would’ve I done without you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Broken Loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so my least favorite feedback loop started and went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search for possible fix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change &lt;code&gt;ci.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;jj squash --ignore-immutable &amp;amp;&amp;amp; jj git push&lt;/code&gt;3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open “Actions” tab&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open latest run&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Linux ARM run&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wait couple of seconds&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hate Life&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Offer the Universe choice words it won’t soon forget&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rinse &amp;amp; repeat&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got quite efficient when it comes to points 8 and 9 but otherwise the whole loop still took around 2-3 minutes to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FOR. A. SINGLE. CHANGE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. For a single change. Like having an editor with 2 minute save lag, pushing commit using program running on cassette tapes4 or playing chess over snail-mail. It’s 2026 for Pete’s sake, and we5 won’t tolerate this behavior!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now of course, in some Perfect World, GitHub could have a local runner with all the bells and whistles. Or maybe something that would allow me to quickly check for progress upon the push6 or even something like a “scratch commit”, i.e. a way that I could testbed different runs without polluting history of both Git and Action runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But no such perfect world exists and one is at the whim of heartless YAML-based system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Breaking off&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suffered only 30 minutes of such loops. Could’ve done it for longer but I was out of colorful language to use and felt without it the process just isn’t the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a wise saying in the internet that goes like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the love of all that is holy, don’t let GitHub Actions manage your logic. Keep your scripts under your own damn control and just make the Actions call them!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what everyone should do. This is what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deleted &lt;code&gt;build.rs&lt;/code&gt; (with a sliver of sadness because it was really nice - but sacrifices had to be made). I moved all the generation from &lt;code&gt;build.rs&lt;/code&gt; to GNU Makefile, committed the darn files into repository, reverted changes to CI and called it a day. Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exit Code: 0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions, Friends &amp;amp; Gentlefolk, is the reason why we can’t have (some) nice things. I can’t count how many hours I’ve lost debugging the runners or trying to optimize the build process. It’s a sorry process every single time, a time that would be better spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet there are some benefits, like macOS builds that would be quite hard to get otherwise. I don’t know any other system that would be easier to setup than GitHub Actions (if you know one, let me know) but it seems there’s no escape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are all doomed to GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…but at least I dodged the bullet early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;MBCompass is a modern, free, and open-source compass and navigation app without ads, IAP, or tracking. Built with Jetpack Compose, it supports compass and navigation features while being lightweight and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not just a compass. Not a map app.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;MBCompass bridges the gap between a compass and a full navigation app - shows direction and live location without using hundreds of MBs of storage or privacy trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Displays clear cardinal directions with both magnetic north and true north.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Live GPS location tracking on OpenStreetMap.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shows magnetic field strength in µT.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sensor fusion for improved accuracy (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Light and dark theme support controlled via Settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keeps screen on during navigation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Landscape orientation support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built with Jetpack Compose and Material Design.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Runs on Android 5.0+&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No ads, no in-app purchases, no tracking.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Servo 2025 Stats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a brief blog post to highlight the growth of the Servo community in recent years, particularly since Igalia took over the project maintenance in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that this doesnât talk about the technical achievements, though there have been tons of them in the last years. A picture is worth a thousand words so just take a look at this slide from my latest Servo talk which shows how google.com was rendered with Servo at the beginning of 2023 vs September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PRs numbers #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So like we did last year, letâs take a look at the PRs merged on the main Servo repository on GitHub since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="9"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2018&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2019&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2020&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2021&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2022&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2023&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2024&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2025&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="9"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;PRs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1,188&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;986&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;669&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;118&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;65&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;776&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1,771&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,183&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="9"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Contributors&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;27.33&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;27.17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14.75&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4.92&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.83&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11.33&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;26.33&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;42.42&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Contributors â¥ 10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.58&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.67&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.08&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.58&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4.67&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8.50&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PRs: total number of PRs merged.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Contributors: average number of contributors per month.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Contributors â¥ 10: average number of contributors that have merged more than 10 PRs per month.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a clarification, these numbers donât include PRs from bots (&lt;code&gt;dependabot&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Servo WPT Sync&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking this we can see we are close to double the numbers from last year! The numbers in 2025 are way bigger than in the previous years (even checking the numbers from 2018-2019), showing a healthy community working on Servo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next chart is a different view of the same data but split per month, with the number of PRs landed every month, the number of contributors and the number of contributors with more than 10 patches. It shows the evolution over the years and the high activity last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Number of contributors #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now letâs focus on the last 3 years, since the project reactivation, and the numbers of contributors to the Servo project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2023&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2024&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2025&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Contributors&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;54&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;129&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;146&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;â¥ 100 PRs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1 (2%)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3 (2%)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8 (5%)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;â¥ 10 PRs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8 (15%)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;29 (22%)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;43 (29%)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Only 1 PR&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;31 (57%)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;53 (41%)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;55 (38%)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of contributors to Servo has tripled since 2023, reaching 146 different contributors in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we analyze the rest of the data in this table, we can see that the percentage of contributors that do a single PR to Servo in a year has been reduced, meaning that Servo contributors are now usually doing more than one PR to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we check the number of contributors that have done more than 10 PRs in a year, we see the percentage almost doubling from 15% to 29% in the last 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for the top contributors doing more than 100 PRs in a year, we have gone from 1 in 2023 and 3 in 2024 to 8 last year, which represent the 5% of the Servo contributors, showing a good team of very active contributors to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;WPT pass-rate #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letâs take a look at WPT evolution in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;2025&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;January 1st&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;December 31st&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Diff&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Score %&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;48.2%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;61.6%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+13.4%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Subtests (passed/total)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1396647/1998146&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1866247/1998146&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+469,600&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Subtests %&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;69.9%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;93.4%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+23.5%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can check more information about WPT pass-rates at Servoâs website (where you can also find an explanation of the Score number).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that these numbers differ from wpt.fyi because weâre still not running all the WPT tests in Servo, so the total numbers here are smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs not easy to extract conclusions from this data, but it shows the Servo project keeps progressing and supporting more web platform features as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes these numbers grow artificially as new tests are added to WPT for features that Servo already supports (for example, the biggest jump last year was in October getting 188,281 new subtests passing without any change in Servo, just because new tests were added to WPT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GitHub stars #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are about to reach 35,000 stars on GitHub. Itâs good to see the project has not stopped growing since the beginning, and the curve has become steeper in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we check to the official project roles, we have now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5 administrators&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;17 TSC members&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;25 maintainers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;18 contributors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have also started doing Servo releases, we have done 3 so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also the TSC has setup sponsorship tiers for donations. We got 4 bronze sponsors in 2025 and we hope to increase the number of sponsorships in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding donations, we have defined a funding process to request usage of that money. We are currently using it to sponsor Josh Matthewsâ contributions, and pay for self-hosted runners to speed up CI times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo has been present in several events last year, we ended up giving 10 talks all around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrap-up #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea here was to do a quick recap of the Servo stats in 2025. Taking a look at these numbers every now and then is useful, and gives you a different perspective about the status of the project, that one can easily ignore during the day-to-day tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general things have grown a lot in 2025, who knows what would happen in 2026, but we hope we can at least keep similar numbers or maybe even keep growing them further. That would be really great news for the Servo project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Igalia is really proud of what the whole Servo community has achieved together in the recent years, and we hope for a bright future for the project going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside note, by the end of the month Iâll be at FOSDEM talking about Servo, other Servo folks like Delan Azabani and Martin Robinson will also be there. If you are around, donât hesitate to say hi and ask anything about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the official job board: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.getlago.com/hiring&lt;p&gt;We're open-source, mainly use Ruby. Billing is interesting because it lays the ground for the monetization system of any company. Because we're heavily developer-focus, we fit very well with complex use cases for either infra companies and/or enteprises. Companies like Groq, Mistral, CoreWeave or PayPal chose Lago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're now heavily investing in step 2: on leveraging the usage and billing data to make the RevOps stack make more sense. Examples: https://github.com/getlago/lago-agent-toolkit or https://www.getlago.com/platform/ai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this resonates, reach out to talent@getlago.com (whether the job is listed or not)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I created the NUKEMAP in 2012, the Google Maps API was amazing.1 It was the best thing in town for creating Javascript mapping mash-ups, cost literally nothing, had an active developer community that added new features on a regular basis, and actually seemed like it was interested in people using their product to develop cool, useful tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, pretty much all of that is now untrue. The API codebase has stagnated in terms of actually useful features being added (many neat features have been removed or quietly deprecated; the new features being added are generally incremental and lame), which is really quite remarkable given that the Google Maps stand-alone website (the one you visit when you go to Google Maps to look up a map or location) has had a lot of neat features added to it (like its 3-D mode) that have not been ported to the API code (which is why NUKEMAP3D is effectively dead — Google deprecated the Google Earth Plugin and has never replaced it, and no other code base has filled the gap).2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But more importantly, the changes to the pricing model that have been recently put in place are, to put it lightly, insane, and punishing if you are an educational web developer that builds anything that people actually find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NUKEMAP gets around 15,000 hits a day on a slow day, and around 200,000 hits a day per month, and has done this consistently for over 5 years (and it occasionally has spikes of several hundred thousand page views per day, when it goes viral for whatever reason). While that’s pretty impressive for an academic’s website, it’s what I would call “moderately popular” by Internet terms. I don’t think this puts the slightest strain on Google’s servers (who also run, like, all of YouTube). And from 2012 through 2016, Google didn’t charge a thing for this. Which was pretty generous, and perhaps unsustainable. But it encouraged a lot of experimentation, and something like NUKEMAP wouldn’t exist without that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2016, they started charging. It wasn’t too bad — at most, my bill was around $200 a month. Even that is pretty hard to do out-of-pocket, but I’ve had the good fortune to be associated with an institution (my employers, the College of Arts and Letters at the Stevens Institute of Technology) that was willing to foot the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in 2018, Google changes its pricing model, and my bill jumped to more like $1,800 per month. As in, over $20,000 a year. Which is several times my main hosting fees (for all of my websites).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I reached out to Google to find out why this was. Their new pricing sheet is… a little hard to make sense of. Which is sort of why I didn’t see this coming. They do have a “pricing calculator,” though, that lets you see exactly how terrible the pricing scheme is, though it is a little tricky to find and requires having a Google account to access. But if you start playing with the “dynamic map loads” button (there are other charges, but that’s the big one) you can see how expensive it gets, quickly. I contacted Google for help in figuring all this out, and they fobbed me off onto a non-Google “valued partner” who was licensed to deal with corporations on volume pricing. Hard pass, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know that Google in theory supports people using their products for “social causes,” and if one is at a non-profit (as I am), you can apply for a “grant” to defray the costs, assuming Google assume’s you’re doing good. I don’t know how they feel about the NUKEMAP, but in any case, it doesn’t matter: people at educational institutions (even not-for-profit ones, like mine) are disqualified from applying. Why? Because Google wants to capture the educational market in a revenue-generating way, and so directs you to their Google for Education site, which as you will quickly find is based on a very different sort of model. There’s no e-mail contact on the site, as an aside: you have to claim you are representing an entire educational institution (I am not) and that you are interested in implementing Google’s products on your campus (I am not), and if you do all this (as I did, just to get through to them) you can finally talk to them a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is literally nothing on the website that suggests there is any way to get Google Maps API credit, but they do have a way to request discounted access to the Google Cloud Platform, which appears to be some kind of machine-learning platform, and after sending an e-mail they did say that you could apply for Google Cloud Platform funds to be used for Google Maps API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By which point I had already, in my heart, given up on Google. It’s just not worth it. Let me outline the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They clearly don’t care about small developers. That much is pretty obvious if you’ve tried to develop with their products. Look, I get that licensing to big corporations is the money-maker. But Google pretends to be developing for more than just them… they just don’t follow through on those hopes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They can’t distinguish between universities as entities, and academics as university researchers. There’s a big difference there, in terms of scale, goals, and resources. I don’t make university IT policy, I do research.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They are fickle. It’s not just the fact that they change their pricing schemes rapidly, it’s not just that they deprecate products willy-nilly. It’s that they push out new products, encourage communities to use them to make “amazing” things, and then don’t support them well over the long term. They let cool projects atrophy and die. Sometimes they sell them off to other companies (e.g., SketchUp), who then totally change them and the business model. Again, I get it: Google’s approach is throwing things at the wall, hoping they stick, and believes in disruption more than infrastructure, etc. etc. etc. But that makes it pretty hard to justify putting all of your eggs in their basket.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I don’t want to worry about whether Google will think my work is a “social good,” I don’t want to worry about re-applying every year, I don’t want to worry about the branch of Google that helps me out might vanish tomorrow, and so on. Too much uncertainty. Do you know how hard it is to get in contact with a real human being at Google? I’m not saying they’re impossible — they did help me waive some of the fees that came from me not understanding the pricing policy — but that took literally months to work out, and in the meantime they sent a collection agency after me.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But most of all: today there are perfectly viable alternatives. Which is why I don’t understand their pricing model change, except in terms of, “they’ve decided to abandon small developers completely.” After a little scouting around, I decided that MapBox completely fit the bill (and whose rates are more like what Google used to charge), and that Leaflet, an open-source Javascript library, could make for a very easy conversion. It took a little work to make the conversion, because Leaflet out of the box doesn’t support the drawing of great circles, but I wrote a plugin that does it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, even MapBox’s pricing scheme can add up for my level of map loads, but they’ve been extremely generous in terms of giving me “credits” because they support this kind of work. And getting that worked out was a matter of sending an e-mail and then talking to a real person on the phone. And said real person has been extremely helpful, easy to contact, and even reaches out to me at times when they’re rolling out a new code feature (like Mapbox GL) that he thinks will make the site work better and cheaper. Which is to say: in every way, the opposite of Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So NUKEMAP and MISSILEMAP have been converted entirely over to MapBox+Leaflet. The one function that wasn’t easy to port over was the “Humanitarian consequences” (which relies on Google’s Places library), but I’ll eventually figure out a way to integrate that into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More broadly, the question I have to ask as an educator is: would I encourage a student to develop in the Google Maps API if they were thinking about trying to make a “break-out” website? Easy answer: no way. With Google, becoming popular (even just “moderately popular”) is a losing proposition: you will find yourself owing them a lot of money. So I won’t be teaching Google Maps in my data visualization course anymore — we’ll be using Leaflet from now on. I apologize for venting, but I figured that even non-developers might be interested in knowing on how these things work “under the hood” and what kinds of considerations go into the choice of making a website these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More positively, I’m excited to announce that a little while back, I added a new feature to NUKEMAP, one I’ve been wanting to implement for some time now. The NUKEMAP’s fallout model (the Miller model) has always been a little hard to make intuitive sense out of, other than “a vague representation of the area of contamination.” I’ve been exploring some other fallout models that could be implemented as well, but in the meantime, I wanted to find a way to make the current version (which has to advantage of being very quick to calculate and render) more intuitively meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Miller model’s contours give the dose intensity (in rad/hr) at H+1 hour. So for the “100 rad/hr” contour, that means: “this area will be covered by fallout that, one hour after detonation, had an intensity of 100 rad/hr, assuming that the fallout has actually arrived there at that time.” So to figure out what your exposure on the ground is, you need to calculate when the fallout actually arrives to you (on the wind), what the dose rate is at time of arrival, and then how that dose rate will decrease over the next hours that you are exposed to it. You also might want to know how that is affected by the kind of structure you’re in, since anything that stands between you and the fallout will cut your exposure a bit. All of which makes for an annoying and tricky calculation to do by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I’ve added a feature to the “Probe location” tool, which allows you to sample the conditions at any given distance from ground zero. It will now calculate the time of fallout arrival (which is based on the distance and the wind settings), the intensity of the fallout at the time of arrival, and then allow you to see what the total dose would be if you were in that area for, say, 24 hours after detonation. It also allows you to apply a “protection factor” based on the kind of building you are in (the protection factor is just a divisor: a protection factor of 10 reduces the total exposure by 10). All of which can be used to answer questions about the human effects of fallout, and the situations in which different kinds of shelters can be effective, or not.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some more NUKEMAP features actively in the works, as well. More on those, soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For non-coders: an API is a code library that lets third-party developers use someone else’s services. So the Google Maps API lets you develop applications that use Google Maps: you can say, “load Google Maps into this part of the web page, add an icon to it, make the icon draggable, and when someone clicks a button over here, draw circles around that icon that go out to a given radius, and color the circles this way and that way.” That’s the basics of NUKEMAP’s functionality, more or less. [↩]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before people e-mail me about how CesiumJS fills the Google Earth Plugin gap — it doesn’t, because it doesn’t give you the global coverage of 3D buildings that you need to make sense of the size of a mushroom cloud. If they change that someday, I’ll take the time to port the code, but I don’t see many signs that this is going to happen, because global 3D building shapes are still something that only Google seems to own. If you do want to render volumetric mushroom clouds in the stand-alone Google Earth program, there is a (still experimental and incomplete) feature in NUKEMAP for exporting cloud shapes as KMZ files. See the NUKEMAP3D page for more information on how to use this. [↩]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I’ll eventually update the NUKEMAP FAQ about how this works, but it just uses Wigner’s standard t-1.2 fission product decay rate formula. [↩]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wanna be an independent full-service escort in the US? Not sure if it’s for you? Included is tips on getting started, marketing, how to increase your income, male sexual psychology and getting them to hire you again, networking, branding, dealing with the emotional burden, safety, and more!&lt;lb/&gt;My credentials: I escorted from 2018-2020 (I of course no longer escort, however if you happen to see a woman in the ads who looks very similar to me you should hit her up). I charged $1200/hr (with discounts for multi-hour sessions), and earned 50k on my highest-earning month. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Escorting is more difficult to develop widely applicable strategies for because the business is invisible. With online sex work, successful techniques spread fast and get adopted as new defaults because everything is clearly visible. With in-person sex work, all you know is what you do. I also worked primarily as high end (initially charging $800/hr for the first month or two before raising it over time to $1200), which means I am not experienced with lower-rate, higher-volume work; two elements that strongly impact the kind of experience you’ll have. I also am speaking to the US market, which has many differences from other markets around the world, primarily legally. I am assuming you are female; while male escorts can in fact do well, this article is targeted towards women.&lt;lb/&gt;I conducted two surveys, of 165 escorts and 411 clients, and I’ll be referring to findings from these surveys throughout this article. The survey is not meant to represent all sex workers and clients; I gathered responses from my social media, in sex worker forums, and on fetlife, so it’s more a reflection of “people from the western world who follow me or sex-friendly social forums”. But hopefully this is the kind of person you are, so it might be good data for you! &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also experimenting with likelihood ratios (“LR”), instead of p-values. The program I’m using to calculate them is new and there might be some errors, and though I’m doing my best to double check, keep this in mind! Also be aware I checked a lot of correlations, and didn’t do anything to control for the… likelihood ratio equivalent of p-hacking (be kind with me I’m still learning).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Likelihood ratios basically are how much more likely the given correlation is compared to no correlation at all. For example, “r=0.3, LR=100” means that the maximum-likelihood correlation was 0.3, which the data says is 100x as likely as a correlation of 0.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deciding if you should try this&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A summary of things: many of these points I go into more detail later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I probably don’t have to go over the cons, because you already know them. In-person sex work is very highly stigmatized; if you live in a conservative community, if you ever want to work with kids ever, if you have a job that might get mad and fire you, if your options for romance are with men who don’t like sex work, then this is an extremely high-risk thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The safety risks are very different from online sex work; it’s common for escorts to completely conceal their identities and faces online, which actually makes it much less likely to get outed to your employers or family. There are, of course, risks to your legal and physical safety, though they can actually be quite minimal given precautions I’ll address later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work is also emotionally hard for some people, as the job carries huge social weight and touches on a ton of vulnerable chords of our sense of self worth. You might carry away feelings of disgust, shame, or hatred. Not everyone feels like this, but if you do, I would not recommend escorting (or if you do, putting your prices extremely high so you at least get paid a lot more for fewer total experiences of disgust and shame).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the positive side, this job is fully self directed; you decide who you see, when you see them, for how long. You decide your rates, your vibe, where and how you want to work. It’s highly flexible, which means you can do it while raising kids or working another job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: money; even low-end escorts make hundreds of dollars per hour of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically the bigger the city, the higher the rates; in NY and LA you can probably tack on an extra few hundred to your hourly, while in a smaller city like Spokane, WA the going rates might be 20-30% less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means if you’re looking to work as a high end escort, it’s worth either moving to a larger city or establishing a regular travel schedule to the large cities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physical appearance also matters a lot, but compared to online work, your body matters more than your face (as the face is typically hidden in advertisements). I’ve made an extremely rough, super general calculator here to help estimate how much you might be able to charge hourly. This is by no means definitive, it’s only meant to help you get a sense of your possibility range and if it might be worth it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind this is not set in stone; a lot of other things matter too, and I’ve seen smoking babes charging $300 and women not considered traditionally attractive charging $800+.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Basic Demographics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average hourly rate reported was $477, and the median $325. The median monthly income was estimated at $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average length of time escorts had been working was 4.5 years (median 3). The average age was 29, the average number of times per year they were tested for STDs was 6.5, and 45% were in a serious relationship, engaged, or married. 30% expressed they either planned to quit escorting or that it was only a side job; 21% intended to retire early. 62% used a condom for genital penetration (but not oral), 29% used a condom for genital and oral penetration, and 9% reported not using a condom at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The #1 Question: Safety&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How dangerous is the job, really?&lt;lb/&gt;I asked people in my survey about some Bad Things they encountered on the job. &lt;lb/&gt;8% reported legal trouble&lt;lb/&gt;8% reported being arrested &lt;lb/&gt;16% reported physical assault&lt;lb/&gt;17% reported contracting a STD&lt;lb/&gt;29% reported being stolen from&lt;lb/&gt;41% reported sexual assault&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers are not great, and it’s not ideal to go into a job where you’re close to a coin toss away from sexual assault. But for what it’s worth, escorts still reported an average job satisfaction of 5.3/7. Also, I’ve been sexually assaulted on the job (which was sort of my mistake; this was the one guy who I thought I’d screened but actually hadn’t, and if I’d screened him I would have not met him) and I consider escorting totally worth it and would happily continue if my Onlyfans ever takes a plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People reported more Bad Things if other negative experiences were associated with the job as well – like feeling shame or getting into escorting out of desperation (r=0.28). In general, my impression both in person and from the data is that class and attitude matter a lot. If you’re careful, deliberate, if you have the luxury of not taking clients you don’t want to take (which honestly is not a very high bar), if you have confidence you can be successful, if you don’t have a lot of shame around this, if you can charge higher rates with fewer appointments, you’ll likely end up with the kind of targeting and clientele that tend to be safer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, I’m going to be advising you from the perspective of pursuing high-end escorting. This guide will likely help even if you’re not, but my goal here is to get you the most income for the least amount of work. After all, higher hourly rates are correlated with a higher total income, without more hours worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How To Get Clients&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re gonna have to get photos, a website, an email, and put up ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very first step typically is the photos. You’re going to need a set, ideally 15-20 (but you could get away with 7-8), of high quality photos to show off your goods. Unlike online sex work, escort photography typically is much more high-end; think closer to lingerie catalogue than casual selfies. I’m not sure if this is effective, but it’s the norm, probably because you’re trying really hard to convince men to drop several hundred dollars on you because you’re luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s common to hire a photographer to pump out these sets of photos. Most websites don’t allow nudity in the photos you use in your ads, so make sure to get plenty, if not all, non-nude content (typically lingerie).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of escorts choose to use only non-nude content on their websites as presumably a branding choice; such as, “if you want to see me naked, you’ll have to see me in person.” I can’t tell if this is a good move; I suspect it’s less important here than in online sex work, because even if you show nudity, there’s still much farther to go (actually seeing you in person). But still, not showing nudity can signal high class, dominant, powerful, and might be more likely to attract higher power men who are looking to “unlock” something they feel few other people have seen – your nudity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But who knows? I showed nudity, and I did pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should also decide if you want to show your face in your photos. Most escorts don’t. I’d recommend censoring your face when you first start out and get a feel for the landscape; you can always decide later if you want to upload the uncensored photos instead! I’ve anecdotally heard that face-showing doesn’t have a huge impact on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But deciding this early helps with taking the photos, so you can arrange things to block your face or pose where you’re looking away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you have photos, make a website. I’m slightly outdated on this; lots of escorts use Squarespace and Wix, but keep in mind lots of companies don’t want anything to do with sex work and will remove you if they notice you’re doing escort stuff. I use BlueGravity for hosting, which is a bit complicated and I’d recommend trying one of the easy-build sites first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; And of course, you have to choose a name! As usual, make sure to check namespace – search escort directories for your considered name to see how often it’s used. High-end branding is important here, so you might plan on going for something more traditional or classic – I nearly went with the name Esther King (narrowly avoided by a roommate asking if I was trying to actively repulse clients); an example of a good name is Mara Blake. Femininity is also really important! Names like “Eve” and “Emma” are common. You want to stay away from names that signal lower-class in your area. Last names are less important, but make sure they’re unique and easy to remember. The holy grail is getting your full name as a flat domain – e.g. “Estherking.com”, so keep an eye on what domains are available!&lt;lb/&gt;You can include whatever you want on your website, but most escort websites have a standard set of things – an introduction (a few paragraphs about you and your personality), a rates page (listing how much you charge for different amounts of hours), an etiquette page (where you outline behavioral expectations and stuff like if you want them to shower and how to give the donation, more on this later), a page instructing you how to book (some girls include a typeform application, others just ask you to email them), and a gallery of photographs of you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also include stuff like tour information (if you travel, when and where) and a list of stuff you like so they can buy you a gift if they feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The copy on most escort websites sound the same, I don’t know what’s going on or if everybody is hiring the same writer to do their websites? There’s a strong desire to appear high end, so the text is usually stuff like “You see me walking down the marble staircase, silk fluttering from my pale legs as our eyes meet under the Parisian sun”. I only slightly exaggerate. Everybody seems to be pursuing some exotic advanced educational degree, to have traveled extensively, and to be unnervingly elegant. Her website implies that booking her will make you superior to every other man, that you will become enlightened by plowing her platonic ideal of a pussy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most men don’t care too much about the finer details of your textual vibes, but some do; I’d recommend reading through several other websites to get a feel, and figure out what you want to signal. You’ll get the clientele you attract! Some do signal IQ pretty well (also here’s what probably is the single other libertarian escort)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get an email, ideally protonmail (secured if sending to another protonmail account) with your name, and list the email somewhere visible on the website (for screening purposes, more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some escorts advertise themselves as low volume, typically associated with higher ends. I asked escorts what they thought “low volume” meant, and the median response was 3 appointments a week, whereas clients thought it meant 5 appointments a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Ads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ads are the next step – how people find you. There’s several websites to choose from, but the general gist is you upload a few photos, write some text about yourself, and link to your website and social media. Here’s many (but not all) of the popular options. They’re listed in order of correlation to hourly rates, from most to least; so the first had the highest correlation with escorts reporting using it, and their reported hourly rates.&lt;lb/&gt;Eros – the most expensive, charging hundreds of dollars for a prime listing for a single week in a big city. It also is birthed straight from the asshole of Satan, having a reputation for the worst website to touch the face of the earth. It takes a long time for them to approve your ads, and half the time they’ll reject anything you submit without telling you why (as the ad slot you paid $400 for inches closer to its scheduled release, ask me how I know). It does, however, get clients; escorts reporting using Eros also reported the highest income (though this might be just because they have enough money to afford it). It tends to have the classiest escorts. Before Tryst (below), I got most of my clientele from here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slixa – A friendlier option, medium-expensive, they tell you what’s wrong with the ad so you can resubmit. Not huge traffic, a lower total number of listings, probably worth throwing a bit of money at in the beginning to see if it’s worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tryst is the newest up and comer, and my personal favorite. It’s free to list, and you pay monthly for different priority in the stack. It’s got by far the most customizable search, and as far as I can tell has the most total users. For me, most of my traffic ended up coming from Tryst.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P411 – I haven’t used this website, but it’s popular, has high use among high earning escorts, and (as far as I can tell) features a verification and review system. Some escorts refuse to participate in websites that have reviews, more on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PrivateDelights – another popular website with reviews, but correlated with reports of arrest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SeekingArrangement – This website, unlike the above, professes to definitely not allow escorts, and makes it difficult to be explicit about it. Most men connecting through the website anticipate paying around 50-70% less, as women tend to be willing to accept less money if you give them a veneer of not being a real sex worker. You can still attempt to do clear sex work here though – “PPM”, or pay-per-meet, indicates that you want to be paid per meeting, and this is the way to start out the discussion. Seeking Arrangement also had the lowest correlation with arrests,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dating Apps – Advertising on dating apps has gotten harder since the advent of Onlyfans, as there’s been crackdowns on anything resembling sexy advertising. You can try putting a wink-and-a-nudge in your profile; some have success with this but be prepared to buy burner phones if you want this to be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bedpage is the spinoff from Backpage, a bit lower end, and also dirt cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eroticmonkey – also cheap&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SkipTheGames – an ad site most correlated with reports of arrest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adultsearch – also correlated with reports of arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Freestyling?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freestyling is the art of picking up clients in person, typically done by looking cute and hanging out alone in a place where horny men of means congregate – for example, casinos, or a nice bar. I haven’t freestyled, but from my understanding the trick is to flirt heavily with a man, and then either imply or outright state that you’ll be available in exchange for some generosity. If he seems hesitant or strings you along, don’t be afraid to leave him and move on. This is apparently a numbers game, and eventually you’ll find a guy who’s excited enough at the prospect of being with you that he’ll be down to part with whatever your rates are. This is likely more feasible if you charge the kind of rates that men are likely to have on them in cash. Basic safety applies here – rotate your freestyling locations, as staff of the places are often trained to keep an eye out for people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Other Media&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most escorts have Twitters, which are great places to verify that you’ve been active for a while and seem mostly human. A lot also use Switter, the inevitable backup when Twitter gets around to banning all of the escorts. Lots of clients can find you through Twitter, and use escorts networking and crosstweeting each other as discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Screening&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you’ve got your website running, your ads up, and now you’re getting interest from men. What now? The answer is screening!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screening is the process of checking information about clients before you see them. You can choose whatever level of safety you’re comfortable with, but one of the most common setups you’ll find is requesting:&lt;lb/&gt;1. Two references from other providers they’ve seen in the last 6 months&lt;lb/&gt;2. Photographic proof of employment (e.g., a photograph of your work badge or a link to a corporate website with your face listed)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal here is twofold – to demonstrate the man is a respectable client (by checking his reputation with others), and to verify he’s not a cop (with evidence that he seems to have a normal job).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asking references a client, you will ask “Could you give me the email and website of two providers you’ve seen in the last six months?” When he sends you this information, you need to verify a few things –&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The escort he referenced seems established and legitimate; sometimes men will create fake escort listings and websites that they control, to give themselves a free reference. Check the linked social media, see if any of the accounts are new, make sure her photos are consistent and possibly reverse image search to make sure they’re not stolen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check that the contact email listed on the escort’s website is the same email he gave you. Sometimes men will link to a real escort, but provide a real-sounding but fake email they created. This happened to me – someone else used me as a reference for another escort, but gave her a fake email that was slightly different from my actual email. Luckily the escort checked my actual email and let me know!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When emailing the escort, I usually said something like “Hey, [name] contacted me from [his email] and mentioned he’d seen you. Did you see him, and if so would you mind letting me know if everything went smoothly?” Make sure you include his contact information – the escort will probably have to look him up in her records, as she likely won’t remember him by name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically the escort will respond in a day or two with “Yes, I had no issues.” Sometimes they might give more information, like warning you if he’s a high effort client who likes to go multiple rounds or if he’s pushy and you’ll have to stay on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you start seeing clients, expect to get used as a reference and to start getting emails from other providers asking about clients you’ve seen. It’s considered extremely good form to respond; this is a collective safety system we all use to help each other, you rely on their information and they rely on yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can choose how you handle references; how many you want to ask for or how far back you’ll accept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the client is a first-timer with no references, you can choose if you feel comfortable seeing them. I did, but on the condition of more information – I required a phone number and photo of his ID, which helps with better blacklist checking. Make sure to carefully check the photo of the ID for any hint of photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to checking references and employment, it’s also good to run his information against a blacklist. There’s a few out there (like VerifyHim), but the biggest I’ve found starts with “S” and is one that’s known but not super widely publicized, and I’d prefer not to signal boost it to a wide audience. If you’re an escort and would like a recommendation to this blacklist, please send me a request at aellasinbox@protonmail.com from your escort email with a link to your escort website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With blacklists, make sure to run their information carefully. If you have his phone number, run that. Try variations on their email – search just the part before the “@”, in case they use different email providers. If they have a name like “Barbedrodney295”, try searching just “Barbedrodney”. Some men will frequently switch their email to avoid blacklist problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you add a client to the blacklist, do not tell the client. This will only let him know he needs to switch up his info, and will be more likely to get access to another woman in the future. This can suck, but it keeps others safer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run a client and find bad entries on the blacklist, do not tell the client. In these cases I typically either stopped responding, made up an excuse, or said I was fully booked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make sure they’re not police, you want to make sure they’re employed elsewhere. As I mentioned you can do this by asking for a link to something like LinkedIn where their face is shown, and then making sure the face that shows up on your doorstep is the same (and sending him away if it’s not). Some escorts will ask for the client’s real name and employment, and then call their company and ask if the client is employed there – then either make up an excuse or simply hang up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Occasionally, a client has been unable to provide references or proof of employment; I once saw a newly successful higher-up drug dealer who understandably had no linkedin to give me. In cases like these I required a 1-hour coffee meeting, public-only, where I charged 30-50% my typical rates. This allowed me to get a sense of who they were as a person, and I imagined it’d be an annoying amount of effort to go through for police who might prefer easier targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;You’re an Escort, Not A Prostitute&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: it’s not a crime to escort. They’re paying for your time, and you just happen to be quite a slutty woman; what happens between you two is at your discretion and your business and is independent of the money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so, many escorts refuse to discuss sex acts over email, and treat this closer to how you might a date where you’re probably going to hook up. The norm is to put nothing in writing that indicates any illegal activity. Assume there’s a police officer on the other side of every email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some use abbreviations to refer to sex acts; it’s up to you if you feel comfortable doing this. I personally did not. If a client asked about sex acts, I would respond with strong clarification that in my personal life, I might or might not enjoy such a thing, but as a reminder our exchange was about time only. I have one escort friend who considered even this too risky, and would simply not respond if asked about sex acts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many refer to money as donations or gifts, indicating that this isn’t even in exchange for time at all, it’s freely given and nontransactional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For payment etiquette, a common strategy (and one I followed) was to ask the client to not mention the donation, to leave the donation on the counter or the dresser, and then excuse themselves to the bathroom. When they’re in the bathroom, you can then take the money. This way there’s no discussion of payment and no direct changing of hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re meeting in public, the request is to include the donation discreetly in a small gift, such as a book or a magazine, so that the donation is ‘hidden’ inside, and you can ‘discover’ it later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: in every possible way in your interactions with the client and the exchange of money, you want to avoid giving off the appearance that you are doing prostitution. Don’t say or do anything that could be viewed as prostitution-esque; maintain clearly that you are selling your time only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can in fact get issued an escort license in some cities (e.g., San Francisco or Grand Chute, or Jefferson County, WA). I don’t know if this is a good idea, neither I nor anybody I know has applied for this, though I seriously considered. It’s possible it might grant you some legal protection, but also possible it might give you some legal issues, as it puts a lot of information about you in a government file that clearly states you are in fact an escort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s probable that police are more likely to use specific escort directories for stings; the ad websites most correlated with reports of being arrested were AdultSearch (r=.28, LR=930), PrivateDelights (r=.26, LR=328), and SkipTheGames (r=.24, LR=146). It’s unclear if this is causative, but I’d avoid them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Location And Hotel Safety&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So your client passed screening, you’ve managed to avoid any talk of sex, and now you’re going to meet up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incalls are where they come to you, and outcalls are where you go to them. I also did a survey of clients, and 2/3rds of them prefer incalls; this matches with my experience. You can charge extra for either incall or outcall, whichever you want to get compensated more for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a few options for incalls – your place, a secondary place you rent yourself or timeshare, a short or long term hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your place has the bonus of being convenient and no extra cost, but comes at the risk of clients now knowing where you live or neighbors getting suspicious of high male traffic. If you see very few clients and have a rigorous screening process, this might be a good option for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also rent a second place; this still has the problem of neighbors getting suspicious, but at least you’re safe from clients knowing where you live. Often multiple escorts will split the cost of a place that’s used primarily as an incall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most common is hotels. If you only have one or two clients, particularly around that hotel-elusive 11am-3pm time zone, a whole day of rental can be excessive; I used the app Dayuse, which allows hourly rentals during the day and has saved me thousands of dollars. I booked 4-star hotels almost exclusively; 3-star hotels didn’t feel classy enough to match my brand, and 5-star hotels ate into my profits too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I picked 4-5 hotels I liked and mostly rotated through them to avoid staff getting too suspicious. I also developed a fake story if need be for if they ever asked why I kept showing up for a few hours in the middle of the day (tho I never was asked).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When choosing a new hotel, I looked for a few things – larger hotels are better, because there’s higher volume and less chance they’ll notice you or any oddities. I would usually call in advance to ask if their elevators used a keycard or had a freely accessible staircase; it’s very annoying if you have to go down and walk with a man upstairs from the lobby while still trying to be discreet, ideally they just knock on your hotel door and you’re good to go. Even worse, some hotels will ask your client who they’re there to see. The client will say the room number, and then the hotel desk will give them your legal name, typically by calling you and asking “Miss X, there’s a Y here to see you” where the client can hear. Make sure the client can painlessly slip past the front desk and into the elevator with no issues to avoid this trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the private blacklist I mentioned above, there’s a section for hotel reviews, where girls will report if they had bad experiences with hotel staff, and I would often check the reports there for locations to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing lots of clients in a short period of time at the same hotel is probably the biggest red flag to staff, particularly at smaller hotels. If you’re going to see a lot of clients, try really hard to get a larger hotel, or try rotating hotels pretty regularly. Most hotel workers don’t care (I lurked hotel worker discussion groups for a while), but it’s good to avoid raising suspicion anyway. Make sure to stay well dressed, clean, and polite, to indicate to them you are a responsible adult who is not a threat. And if you’re staying multiple days, tip well! You want the housekeeping on your side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A habit I picked up from a friend who got me into this: I also would wrap the discarded condoms in toilet paper, stow it in my purse, and throw away outside the hotel after I left, as I didn’t want to risk housekeeping finding any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are going to the client’s hotel, it’s a lot easier. If he wants you to come to his house, this can be a bit riskier, as houses are much more isolated and it’s less likely someone will hear you if you scream. Some escorts I knew would refuse to see a client at their house until the second appointment, and would only have a first time appointment at a hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Meta-escorts?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you need your own security escort? Some do; they have a boyfriend or something drive them to the location and wait in the car outside. It’s generally good form, particularly with higher-end escorts, to not have your security escort visible at all. I did not use a security escort; instead I installed a location-tracking device on my phone and gave access to two friends I trusted. I also would designate checkin times, where I would text shortly after my appointments ended to verify I was okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;You’re in the hotel room with a stranger, now what?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How To Escalate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time is scary! But it’s less scary than you might think; after my first time I remember being shocked at how easy it was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m going to describe my system here; it’s very likely that something different might work for you. This is meant as a template to get started if you feel utterly at a loss, and if anything here doesn’t jive with your vibe, then don’t do it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the client arrived, I would place condoms and lube within concealed but easy reach of the bed, usually in the nightstand drawer at hotels. I would do a quick teeth brush and make sure my genitals smelled okay, and I’d connect my phone to a tiny speaker (to fit in purse) for music. I’d place the “do not disturb” sign on the outside of the door, and lower the lights to something that would allow us to see but also slightly obscure any buttcrack hairs I might have missed (more on buttcrack hairs later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My strategy depended on the length of time I was booked for. Generally speaking, sexual activity lasted around 30 minutes, and I tried to position this closer to the end of the appointment. If you go at it too early, he’s probably going to get horny again afterwards and attempt to sneak in a second round right under the wire. This is generally speaking; lots of guys are longer and shorter, and some will do strong initiation on their own and you don’t really get a say in the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But roughly speaking, for each length of appointment I’d aim to start the sexual activity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 hour: 15-20 minutes in&lt;lb/&gt;1.5 hours: 30-40 minutes in&lt;lb/&gt;2 hours: 45-60 minutes in&lt;lb/&gt;(2.5+ hours almost always started out with dinner)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, if you require his showering at the appointment, that you have to squeeze time for that in there too, and many will want to shower again after sex. Both of these are typically done on the clock!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another tip picked up from my friend, I had music playlists I made for different lengths of time, and I started the playlist exactly when the client entered. I knew which song was in the middle, and which were near the end, so I could tell how much time we had left without looking at a clock (an impolite move if you’re supposed to be enjoying it). Wearing a small watch is also useful for this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My default strategy was this: I would invite the man in, we’d sit down and talk for a while. I’d establish physical contact in the conversation by touching his hand when laughing at a joke, or crossing my leg so it bumped into his. I would become increasingly charmed, utterly fascinated by his life, and I asked him to explain to me concepts I already knew (remember, they like you smart in order to validate their identity as a man who likes smart women, and they still love teaching you things).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I’m being a little sharp here but this is basically a common internalized strategy women use when genuinely attracted to a man; I did legitimately like around 80% of my clients, and a small % were really wonderful and I still think about them.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, after the right amount of time elapsed and when the moment felt right, I’d lean in for a kiss. We’d make out, and would act increasingly hot and bothered before I’d eventually descend to perform oral sex. After this, things get much more varied, as men have very different preferences for position, length of time, if they want to perform oral on you or not, etc. – but typically, I would then climb up to a cowgirl position if they didn’t direct me otherwise, and ride until I wanted to die.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Condom Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember to grab the condom! Most escorts use a condom for genital penetration, but not for oral. I did the same (in my survey there was no correlation to indicate this resulted in higher STIs). Keep an eye out for improper condom use! It’s very common for a guy to place a condom on his penis the wrong way around the first time; he pulls the condom out of the wrapper, places it on the tip of his penis and attempts to roll it. He then finds that it’s not rolling, because the roll is going the wrong way. He flips the condom over and then rolls it the correct way down. As his penis made contact with the now-outside of the condom, it’s no longer clean. I would usually try to place the condom on myself to avoid it, checking the roll with my fingers before touching it to the penis. But sometimes they want to do it; I’d just watch them, and if they did it wrong I’d just grab them another condom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used Skyn Elite condoms – great feel, very thin, and latex free (in case a client had a latex allergy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would keep a few condoms of multiple sizes in my purse, and keep the smaller prepared in the nightsand. After encountering the peen, if it happened to be too big I got to be like “wow, you’re too big for my condoms! Luckily I have a backup mega bazooka condom for this fat stack of salami.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For lube I used Uberlube – nobody had a bad reaction to it, and it came in a nice, classy little tube that fit in even the smallest of purses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Getting Down To Business&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My data is definitely unique to me because I had a regular strategy, but still reflects some degree of male preference; I tracked 70 of my appointments and here’s the stats:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I perform oral: 91%&lt;lb/&gt;Client orgasms: 80%&lt;lb/&gt;Cowgirl position: 66%&lt;lb/&gt;Missionary position: 64%&lt;lb/&gt;Doggystyle position: 37%&lt;lb/&gt;Client performs oral: 59%&lt;lb/&gt;I orgasmed (real): 16%&lt;lb/&gt;Spoon position: 9%&lt;lb/&gt;Prone position: 7%&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the downsides of sex work is that you’re heavily incentivized to do what they want, to make them feel good. If you don’t make them feel good, they won’t hire you again. If you happen to easily orgasm, congrats – you have the privilege of being able to be honest and make them feel good. If you don’t, then you’re faced with a choice – fake your orgasm, or don’t and risk them not hiring you again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most men, I found, were interested in attempting to make me orgasm (though often not good at it), and cared quite a bit about my pleasure. A few didn’t (high correlation with dudes who wanted you to wear specific stuff, imo). I found nearly all of them to be very respectful and kind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found the vast majority of men did not request any unusual fetishes from me. I got a handful of foot fetishes, a handful of roleplayers, and one guy who did not need to wear a cock sheath but was very into wearing a cock sheath – but most at least behaved very vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for them not to orgasm! Some are older and simply can’t; others are really nervous, others have porn-dick and your vag is too soft for the required hand-slamming that’s by this point their only hope. It’s almost certainly not your fault, and be careful not to blame them either. I acted like it wasn’t a big deal at all, like I saw it often (which were both true). I was careful not to be overly reassuring, as I didn’t want to convey that this was something important enough to do a lot of reassuring about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some want to go for multiple orgasms; this is up to you. Some, typically lower-priced, higher-volume escorts, will have an explicit one-orgasm-only policy. Higher-priced, lower-volume escorts tend to be more girlfriend-experiencey, replicating the experience of a one night stand with someone you’re super into, and so won’t explicitly limit the amount of times anybody can orgasm (that would be weird to do with a one-night-stand).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(The absolute worst are the guys who don’t particularly want to cum again but force themselves just to get the biggest value for their money. I hate you)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cowgirl can be hard and exhausting. If you’re not very good at cowgirl, it’s worth it to practice twerking in the cowgirl position on your own. Youtube videos are great at this – remember the movement comes from your legs, not your back!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Fun fact; there was possibly a negative correlation between my likelihood of real orgasm and his physical attractiveness (r=-.12, LR 7.5), but a positive correlation between my real orgasm and how much I liked his personality (r=0.18, LR 60))&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Boundaries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some clients will try to push your boundaries. Maybe you don’t want butt stuff, and he keeps trying to slip a finger in; maybe he wants to talk to you in a way that makes you uncomfortable, or wants more dick sucking than your poor jaw can handle. Prepare yourself beforehand in reacting to this; it can be hard to say no to a client who’s paying you, especially if he seems nice or threatening, or if he’s pushing very slowly. I often would allow a boundary to be pushed, and then decide never to see him again, because I am nonconfrontational.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My worst experience with a client (the one I accidentally failed to screen! if I had I would have seen other women reporting similar experiences!) was someone who did had a few warning flags beforehand:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A) He pressured me to drink more alcohol. I typically have a max of one drink, but he heavily encouraged me to drink more (which I did).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B) The appointment was 1.5 hours, and he spent over 1 hour of it at the hotel bar with me, consistently ignoring my increasingly strong suggestions that we migrate upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C) He put the donation directly into my purse when I went to the bathroom. Opening up my purse without my presence or permission is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D) This one is ‘after’, but he pushed our session well past the ending limit, giving me no opportunity to take a graceful break.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This client ended up being very rough with me, hitting, biting, and choking me quite hard, as well as telling me aggressive, degrading stuff about me being a “whore” who deserves this. At no point did he ask permission to do any of it. I remember evaluating my chances at escape, trying to figure out if hotel staff would hear me if I screamed. But I at no point gave him an indication that I did not like what he was doing. I was afraid that if I showed any resistance, that this would count as an escalation and that he would hurt me. As I was trying to figure out the chances he was gonna get murdery on me, I emitted fake moans of pleasure. As I headed out the door I was cheerful, kissed him, said I would be happy to see him again, and then I GTFO’d.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Unfortunately, reporting this client to the police wasn’t an option, as I was afraid I would be arrested myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My point is that I viewed myself as a person with good boundaries before this; the boundary violations came in slow and steady, and I didn’t find any individual one worrying enough to pay attention to before it was too late – and when it was too late, I was afraid to institute the boundaries. If anything makes you feel strange, trust yourself, don’t dismiss it as probably being oversensitive. If your gut intuition evolved for anything, it probably was for detecting danger around men and sex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Ending the session&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what happens if your time is coming to a close and he’s still pounding away? I try to increasingly signal ‘let’s end this’ with all the subtle power I have within me (like asking him to cum). If he’s not getting the message, I’ll whisper into his ear that I’m having so much fun but we don’t have much time. If he still doesn’t get the message, I’ll stop him saying I have to pee; I go to the bathroom, and when I come out I make sure the tone has changed; like “Damn sucks we have to end on such a cliffhanger, I hope I get to see you again to finish.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having to boot people wasn’t common for me; in my survey 35% of escorts checked the “I wish more of my clients would leave on time” box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can go over time if you’d like, but be careful of blurring boundaries of personal and professional. If you’re going to go significantly over time, you can discuss payment – lots of escorts have a pre-set in-session extension rate. If it’s just a little over, it’s up to you. I tended to be very firm, because I’m a super heavily compartmentalizer and this was necessary to protect my ability to enjoy my clients. One of my friends would regularly let her clients stay an additional 10-15 minutes if they were slow, as she considered the extended goodwill to be worth the extra time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Tipping&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience, it was not standard for clients to tip; I got a gift or tip on 15% of my appointments. I put a line on my website explaining that tipping was not expected and I wouldn’t be upset if they didn’t, but that it was nice if they had an utterly fantastic time. Most escorts don’t mention tipping on their websites. Most of my tips consisted of around $100-200.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Who Are These Clients And Why Do They See You?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The men who saw me had generally white-collar professions; according to my personal spreadsheet, we had:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finance(x4), lawyer(x3), engineer(x3), artist(x2), CEO(x2), doctor(x2), hedge fund manager(x2), software engineer(x2), AI, biotech, data analyst, movie director, electrician, investment advisor, manager, marketing, perfumer, producer, real estate investor, screenwriter, special effects designer, student, teacher, think tank, vice president, writer, and youtube creator. The median income for my client survey was 100k.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average age of the man I saw was 46, and the avg reported on the survey was 41.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found clients tended to fall into a few groups; here’s some of my stereotypes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The young and inexperienced. He wants to “know what it’s like” and is torn between his inability to attract women in real life and the roaring sex drive of his 20’s. They tend to be more shy, and to have been taught to treat women carefully and really really want you to have a good time. The occasional virgin is in this category. (from my personal records, the younger a client was, the less time he spent talking; r=0.24, LR=621)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The busy businessman, who could probably attract women if they tried but they simply don’t have the time. They flew into town yesterday and are leaving tomorrow, they’d love to go on a date and relax with a pretty woman tonight, but can’t be bothered to spend hours on dating apps or making a gamble at the bar. They want a sure thing. These tended to tip better, be wealthier, and have the most interesting conversations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The married man – he married a long time ago and built a life with the woman he loved – but now she doesn’t want to have sex with him. Maybe he’s tried to talk with her about it, maybe not, but one thing is clear – she would absolutely not tolerate him finding sexual fulfillment outside the marriage. So he is seeing you, because you’re a neat and tidy sexual experience that isn’t a coworker or a neighbor and isn’t going to mess up his personal life.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also “Hobbyists” – a slightly derrogatory term that sex workers use to refer to a type of guy who treats escorts a bit like pokemon; gotta catch them all. Hobbyists tend to want quantity over quality, tend to be less interested in connection with the woman he sees, and to write and read reviews (often detailed and graphic) for escorts, sort of like a conquering trophy symbol. Hobbyists tend to prefer seeing lower-priced escorts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I estimate about 80% of the men cared a lot about my experience, and about 20% viewed me more as an object. Again, my experience is higher end; the lower end you go, the more likely you are to get booked by men who are less respectful of your boundaries. Escorts who charge lower prices are more likely to have requirements for the clients they see, typically for them to be over a certain age or to be of a specific race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There does seem to be, unfortunately, a racial association with how well they treat you; I’ve encountered numerous reports on forums of people avoiding specific racial groups. I suspect this effect shows up at the lower end of price range; at my rate of $1200/hr, I personally saw no difference in how I was treated by different races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wealthier clients tended to book longer appointments (r=.29, LR=1.5e+8), spend more total on escorts (r=.56, LR=1.5e+34), see escorts more often (r=.2, LR=18000), and be in a romantic relationship themselves (r=.15, LR=100). They also were slightly less likely to indicate that reading reviews for an escort before meeting her was important (r=-.19, LR=1600); my guess here is that wealthier clients tend to be more personality-oriented in choosing escorts, and that review sites tend to emphasize sexual aspects (while reminding clients of the uncomfortable fact that she has in fact seen many other men).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clients who feel shame about seeing escorts report enjoying interacting with escorts less (r=-0.37, LR=1.9e+13), tend to be a bit younger (r=0.19, LR=1500), were slightly more likely to report seeing escorts who used photos that were misleading about their appearance (r=-0.17, LR=305), and slightly more likely to report being unable to get laid elsewhere (r=0.17, LR=443).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clients who prefer younger escorts tend to see escorts a bit more often (r=0.15, LR=97); clients who prefer older escorts tend to enjoy interacting with them a bit more (r=0.17, LR=487) and place more importance on personality (r=0.14, LR=62).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Who They Want You To Be&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, as is basically common knowledge by this point, the majority of the men you see will be significantly interested in getting to know you as a person, and being known by you. They talk, a lot, it’s good to encourage it with lots of questions. You operate a little bit like a therapist and confidante, most men do not want to fuck just a body, they want to fuck a soul, and it’s important to present yourself whole and aware as you shudder with delicate feminine ecstasy under their fat stack of salami.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are here to be the ideal woman; you want nothing from them they don’t want to give, you are fascinated by their words, you find their jokes hilarious, you are touched by their struggles to get where they are, your nipples get hard when they glance at your lips, you are playful and show them a childlike wonder at the world, you find the stories about their wives charming, you are split open at the heart and begging them to touch you, you are beautiful and heaving and witty and insightful, you are very smart, you find them smarter, you will think of them later, you won’t ask them to call you later, you will never get upset at them, you don’t need them to take care of you. You are the woman that only exists when a few thousand dollars are resting on the nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wax a little poetic here, but it’s largely true, and probably you know it and have been shaped by it in your life already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They still want to work for it at least a little (and sometimes a lot), to prove to themselves that they earned this in some way besides the money. I would sometimes “get frustrated” that I couldn’t orgasm, before asking them to shift position and then having a fake orgasm, in order to demonstrate that some effort on their part was in fact required. Remember to treat them as an equal, not a superior, to slowly dole out the perfect woman to them as they ‘earn’ it by charming you; don’t lay it all out too fast. You’re here to create the illusion that none of this is about money, and if it’s not about money then it has to be about something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You love sex. You are a sexy horndog who wants nothing but getting railed to china and back every day of the week. You took this job because you love sex, not because you need to pay your student loans. The money is just an ‘excuse’ to be a slut, a ‘why not make money off of something i love’, a side effect. Remember: men do not want to make you feel bad; this is not sexy to them. If they get the impression that you don’t like your experience with them, that you’re only pretending, they are very unlikely to return. Their fantasy is getting an opportunity to spend some time with a woman who is on the cusp of banging them anyway, and just needed a little financial reason to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(To be clear; as an escort I did genuinely like most of my experiences with clients, although apart from a handful of memorable experiences with talented men, most of the sex was mediocre. But most of my sex I had on casual dates from dating apps were mediocre too, so whatever)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Women&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, women will hire you. In my experience this was very rare, and in every case I was hired by the woman as a gift to her man in a threesome. These have pros and cons; being a hired third wheel is super high variance, and is easier insofar as the woman takes up more of her man’s energy, and worse insofar as you have two people to pay attention to now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, men will hire you and another escort together, a practice referred to as “hiring a duo.” Some escorts advertise regular duo escort partners they’re familiar with and like working with, but some guys will want to hire you and another escort they like but that you don’t know at all. I don’t have a ton of experience working in duos. I typically meet the woman beforehand briefly to discuss preferences and limits. In the session, I’ve found the oral sex is generally faked on each other (it’s very weird eating out a coworker) by covering the labia with the mouth and then not actually moving the tongue. I don’t know if this is standard; it’s probably way more fun to do a duo with another woman who you actually enjoy having sex with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Getting More Business&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How To Look&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This depends a lot on the kind of clientele you’re going for, but I found most men prefer an understated, girl-next-door kind of look; jeans, t-shirt, flats type deal. Even with keeping it real, it’s important to still keep it classy – be clean, put together well, pay attention to the details. You want to signal that you’re successful, responsible, and wealthy (remember, you’re doing this because you want to, not because you need the money). I wore a lot of minimalistic, versatile high-end dresses and chunky heels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can still express yourself a lot in appearance, as they like seeing your personality. Just make sure it’s not too extreme, too threatening or intimidating, too messy, or too sexy – they want to feel like they’re on a date with a normal girl, not with a whore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t wear lipstick, it’ll smear on them and they probably have a wife to come home to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do wear perfume, keep it subtle, you’ll be very close and they probably have a wife to come home to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you wear a necklace, keep it short, like a choker, so it doesn’t swing into their eye when you’re on top of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you wear rings, take them off before banging, so you don’t destroy their dick as you stroke it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wear clothing that’s not a pain in the ass to take off; soft, touchable things with quick ties and buttons are great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice lingerie is a bonus (occasionally you’ll get a big lingerie fan), but I often found the men immediately discarded it and didn’t even notice what the lingerie looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A change of underwear is good for before or afterwards, so you don’t have to arrive and depart in the same kinda sweaty string lace thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;False eyelashes are dangerous, as you’ll likely be squeezing your eyes shut hard or rubbing up against him&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s up to you if you’re down to take clothing requests – in general I recommend against this, as this is a visible indication that you’re willing to change your self expression for them, and lots of guys register this as not genuine. But some guys do want you to wear a specific thing and don’t care too much about if you’re genuine, so if you want to hit that market then taking clothing requests are a good idea. You can mention you take clothing requests on your website (or they might bring it up themselves in email).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Pricing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much should you charge? I’d look around at other escort ads and websites in your city to get a sense for what range of appearance charges what. Your attractiveness is important to understand when pricing yourself; in comparison to online sex work especially, your body matters more than your face. Keep in mind that other escorts tend to not be as hot as they seem to be in their photos; you’re seeing the carefully selected, most-flattering versions of themselves. The escorts I met in person were much more… normal seeming than the gorgeous vibes presented on their websites (I’m sure I’m included in this). Even still, monthly income in my survey was moderately correlated with self-reported attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a very general rule, I’d recommend erring slightly on the higher end of rates; at the very worst you just won’t get a lot of business, but the business you do get will be better quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some escorts are nervous to change their prices, but I don’t think this is quite so big a deal. If you drop them, do it silently; simply update your website and ads, and bring it up to recurring clients if they ask. If you want to raise them, you should announce this so people know you’re doing well. You can grandfather current clients into previous rates; I often did a thing where I announced I was going to raise rates, but that I’d grandfather anybody in for a year who booked in the next month or whatever. Keep in mind this can be annoying to track and you’ll have to keep good records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to my survey, escorts who charged more per hour also got booked for longer appointments (r=0.44, LR=4e+7) and made more total money (r=0.59, LR=3e+15), even with fewer appointments. The sweet spot will be different for everyone though; one of my friends found she lost income after raising her rates $200.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of escorts will charge an additional fee, typically around $100-200, for either incall or outcall; whichever you want to get compensated more for doing. I charged $200 for incalls, because I had to book a hotel and wanted to cover it; some escorts who use their own home for incalls will charge more for outcalls, because they have to travel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most escorts offer discounts for longer hours booked. You can adjust the discount according to how much you want to incentivize longer appointments, and this is very much up to your personal preference. You can see the spreadsheet I used to figure out my own early pricing here (tho I didn’t build it with public consumption in mind).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also charge more for traveling; if the client wants you to go somewhere three hours outside the city, be prepared to have an additional rate. Some clients might take you up on the elusive and prized FMTY (“Fly Me To You”), where they pay for your flight, and typically a bit extra for your travel time, and bring you to them for (usually) a longer appointment. It’s common for escorts to have separate FMTY rates listed on their profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also establish a cancellation fee within a certain amount of hours before your appointment; I requested something like 20% if cancelled 24 hours before, and 50% if cancelled 6 hours before. There’s a good chance they simply won’t pay you, and there’s no way to enforce them paying you, but if they do want to ever see you again you can require that cancellation fee first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some escorts require deposits before the appointment, where they keep the deposit if the guy cancels, or if they fear the guy might try to steal money. This is less common; I required deposits of 20% for long appointments (6+ hours), because I had a lot of time booked up that would be a painful loss if they cancelled. Deposits are hard to do because everybody wants anonymity and payment processers are cruel; I typically accepted amazon gift cards or crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recommend against negotiating rates! There’s exceptions (often providers will do negotiations with clients they really like who might want a unique arrangement), but by-and-large negotiating price indicates to the client that your boundaries in general are negotiable, and blurs the boundaries of your role as a provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Double Identity?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One strategy I’ve heard a few girls try is having two identities you run ads for; as your face might be obscured, this isn’t super hard. You list two different sets of ads under two different names, and you advertise two different price points. The goal here is to capture both low and high markets; for example you might get 15 appointments a month from your lower-priced identity, but could also grab 2 appts a month for your high-priced one, whereas otherwise you’d miss out on one set. Doing this is more work, and you have to be careful not to cross clients, but might be a good option especially if you’re very unsure what price point is best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Tours&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can travel! Lots of escorts tour, which is basically to schedule a trip to another city, publicly advertise you’ll be there, put up ads in that city (lots of ad sites have a special designation for tours), and then book clients for that city. This is especially great if you live in a smaller city or if you’ve “exhausted” your local client base. Tours can be expensive, though; escorts sometimes charge higher prices on tours to offset this, or require deposits from clients who book on tours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Shortest Appointment To Offer?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some escorts will refuse to offer shorter appointment times, as a way to indicate that they are a “get to know you” kind of girl and not the fast-slam-bam type. Higher end norms are to offer 1.5hrs as a minimum appointment length; 1hr is midrange, and a 30minute minimum is typically lower end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started out with a 1.5 minimum, but eventually switched to 1hr minimum, but made the rate for 1 hour very expensive; only slightly less than a 1.5. I found this worked well for me; I rarely got bookings for 1 hour, but when I did I was quite happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Overnights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overnights are when you spend the night with your client, and you can choose whether or not to offer this. I did, and stipulated that I required a minimum of 7 hours of sleep (to guard against boners poking you in the night), with a 14 hour total minimum. On overnights I would bring a sleeping pill to discreetly take before bed. Keep in mind very long appointments can be absolutely exhausting for some.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Reviews&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should you allow reviews? My recommendation is no, but some escorts do really like them. In my client survey, clients who reported reading reviews before seeing an escort tended (slightly) to be younger, poorer, book lower priced escorts, and feel shame about seeing escorts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reviews sort of break the spell you’re attempting to weave that you and the client have a uniquely special bond; reviews often are done by hobbyists, and tend in general to be more sexual than you might prefer. They also reinforce the view of you as a whore, and most of your work is in presenting a brand that is the opposite of nearly everything people think of when they think of whores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Booking Assistants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people hire other people to manage their bookings for them; you might also run into one of these from another escort when asking them for client references. I used a booking assistant (someone I trusted in my local community and taught what to do) and it was awesome; just make sure they are very careful with screening!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Exclusive Arrangements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, forms of exclusive arrangements can be on the table. Some escorts will advertise the ability to pay them an obscene amount of money in exchange for them only seeing that one client. I get the impression that often this is done quietly, under the table, where an escort sees many clients, one expresses an interest in taking her exclusive, and the they privately negotiate a price and the escort then takes her ads and website off the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(One of my most awkward appointments was with a pair of these; I was hired by a male-female couple, and when he excused himself to the restroom she told me that she was also an escort, had entered into a long-term exclusive relationship with him, and was trying to end it; she was hoping getting him to have sex with someone new would help. The session involved her trying to encourage me and him to have sex while he very clearly only wanted to touch her. As I rode him, he only looked at her. I felt bad for him, but he was consenting, but also holy shit it was so awkward.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some escorts have long-term, sustainable arrangements with only one or two clients, and they don’t run ads or accept any new clients. This can be the holy grail!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Personal Stuff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Periods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hormonal birth control can let you skip periods. If you don’t want to do this, the strategy I used was to buy sea sponges, cut them down until they fit in my vagina, soak them in warm water, squeeze the water out, and then slip it in right around my cervix. These are basically undetectable, and feel just like your vaginal wall, and depending on your vaginal shape it’s even undetectable to aggressive fingering. The downside here is getting them out; you have to squat, bear down, and fish around with your fingers, and try to get enough of a grip to pull, for what can often be a frustratingly long and exhausting period of time. You could try tying a string around it (but would be more detectable); I had slightly better luck using a bigger sponge and cutting a hole in it for my finger to latch around. I’ve once needed someone else to get the sponge out for me (and I once was the volunteer to help another escort pull her own sponge out).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other people report success with soft cups, but those can spill and I am not so brave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Pubes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do with pubes and the aforementioned buttcrack hairs? You can leave them long, though keep in mind this is more niche, and you might benefit from having photos that hint or show pubes on your website so men know what they’re getting into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you’re not advertising pubes, know that cleanshaven is the expected default. Waxing is ideal, so you don’t sandpaper your client, but shaving also works if you do it right beforehand. Laser hair removal is probably a worthwhile investment at this point!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;STD Testing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you tell your healthcare provider you’re an escort, they will likely very happily try to get you STI tested as much as humanly possible. The average escort reported getting STI tested a little more than once every two months; I got tested about once every three months. The amount you should get tested probably depends on how many clients you’re seeing, and the type of client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind there’s some things standard STI panels don’t regularly check for – stuff like trichomoniasis or myco/ureaplasma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Handling It Emotionally&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This job can be really emotionally hard in various ways; maybe you don’t get booked enough for the rates you want, and this can be a hard reflection on how attractive you are. Clients can be rude, or pushy, or uncaring, and keeping your boundaries firm can be very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also a lot of social shame that comes with the territory (often increased if your rates aren’t very high). I have a friend who felt disgusted and disgusting after clients, with a compulsive need to shower to get rid of their smell. Some are very attraction-oriented, and feel degraded by having sex with clients they find disgusting. This can be really hard to deal with; I don’t experience this personally, so my best advice is simply to raise your prices so you see fewer clients, and get rewarded more when you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take escorting slow; this isn’t a race. If you do take an emotional toll doing this work, be mindful to constantly evaluate if it’s worth it for you, if this is what you really want to do. Consider finding other escorts in your area to be friends with (you can look up their ads and email ones you like!); having a likeminded community can drastically reduce the amount of shame you feel for this job. If you’re in a conservative culture you need to hide your job from, take active steps to find a more sexually liberated community to bond with. Much of the emotional burden is actively caused by the judgment of your social surroundings – so change the surroundings!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my personal sex life has been unaffected by escorting, except in one key element – my standards have raised. Personal sex still feels just like it did before escort sex; I have no trouble bonding or wanting my partner, but I now am much less likely to endure free sex that I don’t particularly enjoy, or push myself to do unpaid sex acts that don’t really thrill me. It’s unclear if this is a blessing or a curse; going for exactly what I want feels good, but also it narrows the pool of people I can have sustainable sexual relationships with, as I’m less willing to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Taxes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government still expects you to pay taxes despite it using those tax dollars to try to put you in jail for your job. If you choose to fund the government for this is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government will likely expect you to report income that is consistent with your lifestyle, and if you don’t this can make audits go worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as I know, at the time of writing this, banks are required to report cash deposits over 10k to the IRS. How you choose to deposit is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I personally did report and pay taxes, as did the other escorts I knew. Most didn’t want the stress of trying to hide income.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Escorts often report a job that’s not ‘escort’ on their tax returns; any sort of vague, gig-based independent thing can work well for this; coaching, modeling, consulting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Legalization and regulation?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible legalization would make things worse than we have now, by driving down the prices and also reducing quality of life for sex worker (I have an escort friend who once told me “the day they legalize sex work in the US is the day that I quit). Legalization tends to come with burdens that give power to others; in that one county in Nevada where sex work is legal, you have to work in a licensed brothel, and you have to pay that brothel in order to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other places might ban brothels or “living off the proceeds of a sex worker” for fear of pimps, but in the process this means a sex worker isn’t allowed to move in with another sex worker (now it’s a brothel) for safety, and isn’t allowed to support anyone else off the money she earns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some well meaning but utterly incompetent places think it’s a good idea to make it illegal for johns to hire a sex worker, but don’t prosecute the sex worker. This increases competition of sex workers for johns, artificially drives prices down, gives johns greater bargaining power over sex workers, and doesn’t fix the problem of johns trying hard to remain anonymous and requiring situations where you’re less able to go to the police if you wanted. Sex workers hate this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of escorts I’ve talked to want decriminalization, not legalization. We simply want it to be not illegal to do what we’re already doing. This would allow us to go to the police if we need to, would allow better screening services to operate without fear of being taken down (I couldn’t even name the best screening service here in this article!), without imposing additional burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Heart Of It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of this guide might seem a bit cold and calculated, but cold and calculated doesn’t mean there isn’t heart; I’ve “coldly” analyzed many things that I love or deeply move me. You can break down the romantic mating dance between men and women into brutal evo-psych theories about status and competition and shit-tests and pheromones, but the felt experience of romance is no less true or powerful – it’s just harder to write a guide about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve had many clients that I remember fondly and who mean a lot to me. One client I would regularly hold in close skin-to-skin contact as he cried, and I cried with him; another was young and vibrant and too big for the small world around him. Another was a quadriplegic, and yet another was a talented writer who valued rarely seen things in me and encouraged me to do great things without ever once implying escorting was beneath me. Another whose wife had recently died and found me as his first foray into being with another woman, because he couldn’t bear to fully date another person yet. I’ve had clients figure out who I am and show up asking me to tripsit them on psychedelics, wildly successful CEOs who treated me as an intellectual equal, or people who were dying of cancer and didn’t want to go out without another bang (I recently looked up one of my favorite clients and instead found his obituary).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A part of me really fell in love with these people, and I consider my experiences with them immensely valuable and I am honored to be able to have been there for them in that way. And the part of me that loves them gets furious when people mock all sex work as degrading or meaningless. You don’t know how deeply I’ve touched and been touched. There’s a thread of sacredness in here, of vital work that is profoundly healing and I will defend these men until I die.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is part of the strange world of escorting; you get the good and the bad, the men who push your boundaries and the men who respect you immensely. You get high pay in exchange for social shame, legal risk for many more hours of free time. It’s a wild world and I don’t regret a second of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And am I worried that posting this will destroy my ability to escort in the future – would it make men not want to hire me? My hope is that it will discourage the men who should be discouraged, and encourage the ones who know they’re more likely to make me actually happy.&lt;/p&gt;
