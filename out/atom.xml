  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Cryptography and Security&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 10 Oct 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Modern iOS Security Features -- A Deep Dive into SPTM, TXM, and Exclaves&lt;/head&gt;View PDF&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:The XNU kernel is the basis of Apple's operating systems. Although labeled as a hybrid kernel, it is found to generally operate in a monolithic manner by defining a single privileged trust zone in which all system functionality resides. This has security implications, as a kernel compromise has immediate and significant effects on the entire system. Over the past few years, Apple has taken steps towards a more compartmentalized kernel architecture and a more microkernel-like design. To date, there has been no scientific discussion of SPTM and related security mechanisms. Therefore, the understanding of the system and the underlying security mechanisms is minimal. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of new security mechanisms and their interplay, and create the first conclusive writeup considering all current mitigations. SPTM acts as the sole authority regarding memory retyping. Our analysis reveals that, through SPTM domains based on frame retyping and memory mapping rule sets, SPTM introduces domains of trust into the system, effectively gapping different functionalities from one another. Gapped functionality includes the TXM, responsible for code signing and entitlement verification. We further demonstrate how this introduction lays the groundwork for the most recent security feature of Exclaves, and conduct an in-depth analysis of its communication mechanisms. We discover multifold ways of communication, most notably xnuproxy as a secure world request handler, and the Tightbeam IPC framework. The architecture changes are found to increase system security, with key and sensitive components being moved out of XNU's direct reach. This also provides additional security guarantees in the event of a kernel compromise, which is no longer an immediate threat at the highest trust level.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶ or writing a blog post with old pics and data again&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, again, a blog post based on years-old pics. I still have at least 20 blog posts to write that will be based on stuff that I‚Äôve worked few years ago üòÄ&lt;lb/&gt;I guess, chasing my own tail is never-ending üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some Playstations that I bought the other day‚Ä¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once wrote a blog post about Nintendo Wii controllers. That post was already based on old data, and the job presented in this blog post is from roughly the same period of time when I bought around 60 various consoles to learn how to fix them and to show them to my son.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had around 9 PlayStation 2 units. Seven were the FAT PS2s, and I will be covering only fixes/mods that I find a bit more interesting than the usual clean&amp;amp;run scenario. Obviously, a lot of time passed, and nowadays there are way better mods available, but anyway, let‚Äôs go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemme first show you how it all looked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main issues to sort out were rather simple. Cleaning, broken plastic, dead fans, dead RTC battery cells, etc.&lt;lb/&gt;Below are some pics after disassembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Broken thermal pads everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bit of corrosion here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fixes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PS2 motherboards are well-manufactured and generally free from issues. In my case, all was working fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I had to clean them nicely, replace the original Sony batteries, and replace thermal pads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some pics below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing thermal pads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some drives needed a new laser module. The original is KHS-400C, but replacements are still available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve bought some on Aliexpress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some plastic parts had to be restored to be fully functional. I‚Äôve used acetone, some wire reinforcement, and a soldering iron to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the drives had a chipped-off plastic rail. I‚Äôve temporarily glued ‚Äúsides‚Äù that served as a mold-in-place, filled it with a mix of sodium bicarbonate and cyanoacrylic glue, and used a hand file to trim it to the desired shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, cleaned cases were waiting üôÇ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I had to address issues with power switches. Connectors were tarnished, so I had to disassemble them and clean the contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, I was ready to assemble all units and start adding some mods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mods are rather basic and mandatory in modern days, and have also been covered many times on YouTube. It all basically boils down to the installation of FMCB or FHDB, which is a great solution!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it work, I needed some hard drives, memcards, and HDD adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve bought some brand new 1TB SATA drives along with HDD adapters that are easily available. I had a bit of trouble finding nice and original memcards, but that was sorted out, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I had to prepare a drive to work nicely with PS2. For testing purposes, I‚Äôve used a 2.5-inch drive in a 3D printed bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software used back then to format the drive is Window HDL Image Install Program V1.7.6 By Gadgetfreak&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the above, I‚Äôve used the HDD Raw copy tool to put a downloaded FHDB image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IIRC, this can also be done from the FMCB menu under running PS2, but I wanted to test a PC software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, you can dump images of your original games and put them on the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Controllers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had quite a few controllers, but I needed to test them first and fix them if broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a working PS2 with FMCB or FHDB is handy, as I could upload a PS2 controller tester by jbit_ and check all the pads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some controllers are originally painted with a rubber-like cover that, unfortunately, degrades with time and becomes a sticky gooey. I usually deal with it with the help of Methanol. It nicely removes it. However, such a cleaned surface has to be painted with an undercoating and the desired color afterward. This is exactly what I did with one set of controllers that I had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the six PS2 consoles, I‚Äôve created 6 sets in the following configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PS2 FAT ‚Äì new RTC battery, new thermal pads, laser module&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1TB SATA HDD + HDD adapter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;original 8MB Sony memcard&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;new power wire&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Controller&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PS2HDMI dongle&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, nobody wanted to buy these even for a cost that would cover all the expenses spent on this project. On the bright side, I have learned a lot, plus, I have a cool PS2 to play with üôÇ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See you in the next post. Hopefully, about the machine that I‚Äôve worked on recently, and I still remember all the details üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world‚Äôs largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet‚Äôs attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru‚Äôs owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Aisuru‚Äôs size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google‚Äôs DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru‚Äôs capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru‚Äôs overlords aren‚Äôt just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet‚Äôs top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,‚Äù he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BOTNETS R US&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ferguson said he‚Äôs been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet‚Äôs composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe impact extends beyond victim networks,‚Äù Ferguson said. ‚ÄúFor instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast‚Äôs network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,‚Äù Dobbin said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,‚Äù Dobbins continued. ‚ÄúA lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there‚Äôs going to be a period ahead where there‚Äôs some scrambling and potential disruption going on.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson‚Äôs report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,‚Äù Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. ‚ÄúWith the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Comcast responded, ‚ÄúCurrently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;9 YEARS OF MIRAI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016 by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dobbins said Aisuru‚Äôs owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle ‚Äú9gigsofram,‚Äù which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik ‚Äú9gigsofram‚Äù Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru‚Äôs botmasters chose Buckingham‚Äôs nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,‚Äù Coelho said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn‚Äôt process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;RAPID SPREAD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru‚Äôs rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúMultiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,‚Äù XLab wrote on September 15. ‚ÄúThe node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aisuru‚Äôs operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru‚Äôs curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government‚Äôs takedown, Dobbins said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúFolks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that‚Äôs great, but unfortunately the botnet‚Äôs attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BOTMASTERS AT LARGE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XLab‚Äôs September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: ‚ÄúSnow,‚Äù who‚Äôs responsible for botnet development; ‚ÄúTom,‚Äù tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and ‚ÄúForky,‚Äù responsible for botnet sales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky‚Äôs DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP‚Äôs clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,‚Äù Forky replied. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Copy-and-Patch Tutorial&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy-and-patch Compilation is a fascinating way of constructing a baseline JIT[1]. It permits incredibly fast runtime compilation of code fragments in a very easy to maintain fashion, requires barely any actual understanding of assembly code, and produces native code of sufficient quality to be within the same range as traditional, hand-written baseline JITs. [1]: Baseline JIT, as in a JIT whose goal is primarily to generate code quickly and gain performance by removing interpretation overhead than generating well optimized code itself. Baseline JITs can be paired with optimizing JITs, like V8‚Äôs Liftoff baseline JIT for WASM allowing tiering up into V8‚Äôs Crankshaft optimizing JIT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy-and-patch works by writing stencils, minimal C functions that implement the desired individual operations such that they compile to concatenate native code fragments. At JIT compile time, one can copy the pre-compiled fragment for each operation back-to-back, patching them change embedded constants or addresses as needed..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an adventure into understanding how copy-and-patch works, our goal will be to create the function&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But specialized at runtime to compute &lt;code&gt;1 + 2&lt;/code&gt;. We‚Äôll be doing this by first breaking it down into some bytecode-sized operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;const_int_reg1:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;a = 1;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;const_int_reg2:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;b = 2;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;add_int1_int2:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;c = a + b;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;return_int1:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;return c;&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And to define our copy-and-patch JIT, we‚Äôll take each of these and:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Implement the operation in C with relocation holes to be later patched to form our stencil.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compile the stencil into native code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Copy-paste the native code back into a C file with functions to emit it to a buffer and patch any relocations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we can write our little JIT compilation engine to concatenate our stencils and execute the generated function. Let‚Äôs get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stencils&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first step is to define our stencils:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

#define STENCIL_FUNCTION __attribute__((preserve_none))

extern char cnp_value_hole[65536];
extern void cnp_func_hole(void) STENCIL_FUNCTION;

#define STENCIL_HOLE(type) \
  (type)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_value_hole)
#define DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(...) \
  typedef void(*stencil_output_fn)(__VA_ARGS__) STENCIL_FUNCTION; \
  stencil_output_fn stencil_output = (stencil_output_fn)&amp;amp;cnp_func_hole;

STENCIL_FUNCTION void load_int_reg1() {
  int a = STENCIL_HOLE(int);
  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(int);
  stencil_output(a);
}

STENCIL_FUNCTION void load_int_reg2(int a) {
  int b = STENCIL_HOLE(int);
  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(int, int);
  stencil_output(a, b);
}

STENCIL_FUNCTION void add_int1_int2(int a, int b) {
  int c = a + b;
  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(int);
  stencil_output(c);
}

STENCIL_FUNCTION int return_int1(int a) {
  return a;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We compile this with &lt;code&gt;clang -O3 -mcmodel=medium -c stencils.c&lt;/code&gt;, and examine the generated code via &lt;code&gt;objdump -d -Mintel,x86-64 --disassemble --reloc stencils.o&lt;/code&gt;.  This yields:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;0000000000000000 &amp;lt;load_int_reg1&amp;gt;:
   0:	41 bc 00 00 00 00    	mov    r12d,0x0

  2f:	00

0000000000000030 &amp;lt;return_int1&amp;gt;:
  30:	44 89 e0             	mov    eax,r12d
  33:	c3                   	ret&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(The NOP‚Äôs aren‚Äôt actually a part of the function, they‚Äôre just padding added so that each function starts with 16 byte alignment.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each of these stencils, we fill in a template to form our stencil generation library to use during JITing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint8_t cnp_stencil_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;_code[] = {
  // Copy the bytes from the top of the function until the jmp.
};

uint8_t* cnp_copy_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;(uint8_t* stencil_start) {
  const size_t stencil_size = sizeof(cnp_stencil_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;_code);
  memcpy(stencil_start, cnp_stencil_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;_code, stencil_size);
  return stencil_start + stencil_size;
}

// If any relocations exist for the stencil, fill in the values.
// If not, just skip writing this function.
void cnp_patch_&amp;lt;OP&amp;gt;(uint8_t* stencil_start, /* ... */ ) {
  memcpy(stencil_start + /*relocation_offset*/, &amp;amp;value, /* relocation_size */);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

uint8_t cnp_stencil_load_int_reg1_code[] = {
   0x41, 0xbc, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // mov r12d,0x0
};
uint8_t* cnp_copy_load_int_reg1(uint8_t* stencil_start) {
  const size_t stencil_size = sizeof(cnp_stencil_load_int_reg1_code);

  return stencil_start + stencil_size;
}
void cnp_patch_load_int_reg1(uint8_t* stencil_start, int value) {
  // 2: R_X86_64_32 cnp_value_hole  -&amp;gt;  0x02 offset
  memcpy(stencil_start + 0x2, &amp;amp;value, sizeof(value));
}

uint8_t cnp_stencil_load_int_reg2_code[] = {
   0x41, 0xbd, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // mov r13d,0x0
};

  return stencil_start + stencil_size;
}
void cnp_patch_load_int_reg2(uint8_t* stencil_start, int value) {
  // 12: R_X86_64_32 cnp_value_hole  -&amp;gt;  0x12 - 0x10 base = 0x2
  memcpy(stencil_start + 0x2, &amp;amp;value, sizeof(value));
}

uint8_t cnp_stencil_add_int1_int2_code[] = {
  0x45, 0x01, 0xec, // add r12d,r13d
};
uint8_t* cnp_copy_add_int1_int2(uint8_t* stencil_start) {
  const size_t stencil_size = sizeof(cnp_stencil_add_int1_int2_code);
  memcpy(stencil_start, cnp_stencil_add_int1_int2_code, stencil_size);
  return stencil_start + stencil_size;
}
// No patching needed

uint8_t cnp_stencil_return_int1_code[] = {
  0x44, 0x89, 0xe0, // mov eax,r12d
  0xc3,             // ret
};
uint8_t* cnp_copy_return_int1(uint8_t* stencil_start) {
  const size_t stencil_size = sizeof(cnp_stencil_return_int1_code);
  memcpy(stencil_start, cnp_stencil_return_int1_code, stencil_size);
  return stencil_start + stencil_size;
}
// No patching needed&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a fully automated setup, all of this work will happen as part of the build system. The stencil compilation and transforming them into a library of copy functions and patch functions happens as part running &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your First JIT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our stencil library in place, we can use our code generation functions to build our runtime specialized adder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;assert.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/mman.h&amp;gt;

//#include "cnp_stencils.h"
uint8_t* cnp_copy_load_int_reg1(uint8_t* stencil_start);

uint8_t* cnp_copy_add_int1_int2(uint8_t* stencil_start);
uint8_t* cnp_copy_return_int1(uint8_t* stencil_start);

typedef int(*jit_func)() __attribute__((preserve_none));

jit_func create_add_1_2() {
  // Most systems mark memory as non-executable by default
  // and mprotect() to set memory as executable needs
  // to be run against mmap-allocated memory.  We start
  // by allocating it as read/write, and then switch it

  uint8_t* codedata = mmap(NULL, 256, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
      MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_POPULATE, -1, 0);
  assert (codedata != MAP_FAILED);
  jit_func ret = (jit_func)codedata;

  // Concatenate our program together, while saving the

  int result = add_1_2();
  printf("JIT'd 1 + 2 = %d\n", result);
  return 0;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we can compile and run that!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ clang cnp_jit.c cnp_stencils.c -o cnp_jit $ ./cnp_jit JIT'd 1 + 2 = 3&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve successfully built runtime code generation, while letting clang do the hard work of actually writing the assembly code, and our JIT compiler is just a bunch of memcpy calls!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a header to offer some macros to make declaring relocation holes easier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

#define STENCIL_FUNCTION __attribute__((preserve_none))

extern void cnp_stencil_output(void) STENCIL_FUNCTION;

#define STENCIL_HOLE32(ordinal, type) \
  (type)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_small_value_hole_##ordinal)
#define STENCIL_HOLE64(ordinal, type) \
  (type)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_large_value_hole_##ordinal)
#define STENCIL_FN_NEAR(ordinal, type) \
  (type)&amp;amp;cnp_near_func_hole_##ordinal
#define STENCIL_FN_FAR(ordinal, type) \
  ({ uint64_t _cnp_addr_as_int = (uint64_t)((uintptr_t)&amp;amp;cnp_far_func_hole_##ordinal); \
  asm volatile("" : "+r" (_cnp_addr_as_int) : : "memory"); \
  (type)_cnp_addr_as_int; })
#define DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(...) \
  typedef void(*stencil_output_fn)(__VA_ARGS__) STENCIL_FUNCTION; \
  stencil_output_fn stencil_output = (stencil_output_fn)&amp;amp;cnp_stencil_output;

#define DECLARE_EXTERN_HOLES(ordinal) \
extern char cnp_large_value_hole_##ordinal[100000]; \

extern void cnp_near_func_hole_##ordinal(void) STENCIL_FUNCTION; \
extern char cnp_far_func_hole_##ordinal[100000];&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you‚Äôre interested in the details of why these macros are the way they are, see the next post in the series!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you can declare as complex of a stencil as you need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "cnp_stencils.h"

// Declare up to the maximum number of holes you need of one type
// in a function:
DECLARE_EXTERN_HOLES(1);
DECLARE_EXTERN_HOLES(2);

STENCIL_FUNCTION
void fused_multiply_add_sqrt_ifnotzero() {
  uint32_t a = STENCIL_HOLE32(1, uint32_t);
  uint32_t b = STENCIL_HOLE32(2, int32_t);
  uint64_t c = STENCIL_HOLE64(1, uint64_t);

  uint64_t fma = a * b + c;

  if (fma == 0) {
    void (*div_trap)(void) = STENCIL_FN_NEAR(1, void(*)(void));
    div_trap();
  }

  uint64_t (*sqrt)(uint64_t) = STENCIL_FN_FAR(1, uint64_t(*)(uint64_t));
  uint64_t result = sqrt(c);

  DECLARE_STENCIL_OUTPUT(uint64_t);
  stencil_output(result);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which just for completeness sake, compiles into:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Happy Birthday to us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week is KDE√¢s 29th anniversary. It may not be a nice round number like 25 or 30, but whenever another birthday rolls around for an independent project the size and scope of KDE √¢ powered by the goodwill of its contributors and users √¢ that√¢s really quite something!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year we√¢re celebrating by kicking off our yearly fundraiser. Let√¢s raise at least √¢¬¨50,000 before the end of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Donated (updated daily)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;√¢¬¨50000&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*Stretch goal coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Make KDE√¢s Birthday Wishes Come True&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Producing first-class software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE is on the verge of something big, and the popularity of its free software is on the rise. It√¢s increasingly being adopted by gamers, artists, professionals, companies, and public institutions. But the costs associated with developing and maintaining that software are also growing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation keeps KDE √¢in business√¢ and our software sustainable for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keeping you in control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A core aim of KDE is keeping you in control of your digital life, and we do it by providing high-quality and privacy-conscious free software. But we can only keep doing it by preserving our own financial independence, so that we never become too dependent on any single source of support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation makes KDE truly independent. Funding from the people allows us keep KDE developed by the people, of the people, and for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cleaning up the world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week is also International E-Waste Day, and KDE wants a clean planet too! We started the End of 10 campaign because big tech corporations continue pushing everyone to chase the new shiny√¢¬¶ in the process filling landfills with perfectly functional devices that become terrible sources of pollution when junked*.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation allows us to inform everybody about how they can help stave off these environmental disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Case in point: Microsoft is stopping free support for Windows 10 on hundreds of millions of computers this very week. Many of these old yet perfectly usable devices will not be able to upgrade because of spurious hardware requirements. Microsoft√¢s solution? √¢Throw away your computer and pollute the planet because we want to make even more money.√¢&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reaching people the tech industry left behind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many aren√¢t in a position to replace their devices every few years, or download hundreds of gigabyes of data from an always-on internet connection. KDE produces software that doesn√¢t need the latest hardware or an always-on internet connection, allowing everybody find their space in the digitized world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your donation helps KDE serve those who are ignored by the industry, and bring marginalized users into the community so they can help the project grow for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Helping public institutions adopt free software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governments of the world are starting to realize that using public funds to lock themselves into proprietary closed-source software has been a strategic geopolitical mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free software is publicly owned, representing the safest option for governments that want full control over their machines and safety for their citizens√¢ data. But often the standards required for software approval by public institutions is very high, and their needs very specific.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The rings of DNA inside mitochondria are inaccessible to these techniques, which means that precise edits to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) remain frustratingly out of reach. ‚ÄúMitochondria missed the CRISPR‚ÄìCas9 revolution that exploded 12 years ago,‚Äù says Michal Minczuk, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But researchers are eager to access this DNA, says Minczuk. Mitochondria are bean-shaped organelles that power cells and have myriad other cellular tasks. Exploring their DNA is essential for understanding the energy production and exchange that underlies metabolic health. And more than 300 mutations in this DNA cause mitochondrial diseases ‚Äî incurable genetic disorders with a wide range of symptoms that can rob people of their sight and hearing, trigger muscle problems and spark seizures1. These disorders affect roughly 1 in 5,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because CRISPR can‚Äôt help with these problems, researchers have been looking for other ways to precisely edit the mitochrondrial genome. And the past few years have brought some success: the tools are already proving to be a boon for creating accurate animal models of mitochondrial diseases. ‚ÄúThe progress has been remarkable,‚Äù says Jin-Soo Kim, a chemical biologist who develops mtDNA editing tools at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If researchers can make mtDNA editing safe and accurate enough, it could eventually be used to treat, and even cure, these genetic conditions. ‚ÄúIt would be a medical breakthrough,‚Äù says Kim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bacterial origin&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exact origins of mitochondria are murky, but the leading theory holds that the organelle‚Äôs story started around 1.5 billion years ago when a single-celled microorganism called an archaeon gobbled up a roaming bacterium that survived inside its host. This event marked the beginning of the eukaryotes ‚Äî the large group of organisms, including plants, animals and fungi, in which cells contain organelles that are enclosed inside membranes. The swallowed bacterium retained its characteristic circular DNA as it settled into its new home, but over time it sacrificed most of its genes to the nuclear genome of its host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the evolutionary lineage that gave rise to humans and other animals, this genetic transfer whittled the resident bacterium‚Äôs genome down to just 37 genes that code for 13 proteins involved in energy production, turning it into a specialized organelle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small amount of mitochondrial DNA that stuck around in animals differs in key ways from nuclear DNA, which in humans encodes around 20,000 genes. For a start, mtDNA is typically inherited solely from the mother. There can be several copies of mtDNA in each mitochondrion, and the organelle has its own built-in machinery for making RNA and proteins from that DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is also much more error-prone, with a mutation rate estimated to be 10‚Äì20 times greater than that of nuclear DNA. This is in part because it has to contend with a barrage of damaging reactive oxygen species ‚Äî unstable molecules that are generated in mitochondria during normal energy production. But it‚Äôs also because it doesn‚Äôt have histones: the proteins that protect and package nuclear DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared with its counterpart in the nucleus, mtDNA‚Äôs toolkit for repairing itself is rudimentary. The nucleus is quick to fix a snapped DNA strand using an arsenal of repair mechanisms, but mitochondria can mend only some defects. They often simply throw away their broken DNA. This difference limits the options for gene-editing tools, because nearly all such tools for nuclear DNA use its inherent repair pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been notoriously challenging to develop approaches for modifying mitochondrial DNA, says Stephen Ekker, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. ‚ÄúIts bacterial origins are revealed when you start trying to edit it,‚Äù he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most crucial hurdle for scientists trying to tinker with the mitochondrial genome is that it is locked behind a wall of membranes that doesn‚Äôt allow external nucleic acids to pass into the organelle. Although there have been hints that CRISPR-based gene-editing tools ‚Äî which rely on RNA to guide them to the correct sequence ‚Äî might be able to overcome these barriers, many researchers remain unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Snip and trash&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, there are other ways in. More than a decade before CRISPR became a research tool, mitochondria researchers began experimenting with other editing tools that could cross mitochondrial membranes and coax the organelles into ditching their problematic DNA2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every cell contains a vast number of mitochondrial genomes, because cells contain thousands of mitochondria and each one can carry several copies of mtDNA. Healthy and mutated mtDNA often coexist: a state known as heteroplasmy. It‚Äôs when the proportion of mutated mtDNA reaches 60‚Äì80% in a particular tissue or cell type that mitochondrial diseases manifest3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If researchers could reduce the faulty copies of mtDNA in cells, they could eliminate the resulting disease. So, they turned to enzymes called zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to snip the double-stranded mtDNA. Whereas targeted snipping of nuclear DNA cajoles the cut DNA strands to glue themselves back together without the harmful mutation, the cut DNA in mitochondria is simply cast out. This elimination triggers the remaining intact copies to replicate themselves so that the correct level of mtDNA is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, the mutated copies will be reduced to an acceptable level as the normal copies are replicated. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to make up for what you‚Äôre destroying,‚Äù says Carlos Moraes, a geneticist at the University of Miami in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although there has been progress with this approach, it hasn‚Äôt made its way out of the laboratory. And even if it did reach the clinic, the technique would be powerless against diseases caused by mutations that are often present in all copies of a person‚Äôs mtDNA, such as Leber‚Äôs hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare condition that causes rapid vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What researchers need are tools that do more than cut DNA but that don‚Äôt rely on guide RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRISPR-free base editing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When CRISPR‚ÄìCas9 emerged as a tool in 2012, it became the go-to gene editor for all kinds of application. A guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where the enzyme does the cutting. Genetic changes are introduced as the DNA repairs itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The approach became even more useful in 2016, when David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his colleagues introduced a more precise technique called base editing4. In this case, researchers modify the Cas9 enzyme and rely on another enzyme, called a deaminase, to convert one DNA base letter to another ‚Äî such as cytosine (C) to thymine (T) or adenine (A) to guanine (G).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although base editing and other CRISPR techniques took off for nuclear DNA, Liu and other research teams couldn‚Äôt get it working on mtDNA. Because CRISPR‚Äôs guide RNA doesn‚Äôt readily pass through a mitochondrion‚Äôs double membrane, using precise tools on mtDNA remained a pipe dream. ‚ÄúWe did not have much success,‚Äù says Liu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A solution materialized in 2018 when Joseph Mougous, a microbiologist then at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues stumbled across a toxin made by the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia. This enzyme, a deadly weapon against other bacteria, wreaks havoc by ultimately converting base C to T across the bacterial genome5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mougous, now based at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, e-mailed Liu asking whether the enzyme, called DddA, would be of any use to him. ‚ÄúI knew exactly what it might be used for ‚Äî base editing mtDNA!‚Äù says Liu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But switching every C to a T would be lethal to cells. Liu and his colleagues set out to ‚Äútame the beast‚Äù. They split DddA into two inactive pieces so that the enzyme would do its handiwork on mtDNA only when the pieces were brought together in a particular orientation. And instead of using guide RNA, Liu and his colleagues modified proteins found in TALENs to direct the DddA segments to their target sequences (see ‚ÄòMaking the edit‚Äô).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four years after my post on doing network captures on macOS with Process ID, Wireshark 4.6.0 has been released which includes support for parsing this extra metadata, including the process info.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you do it? Easy! You just need the &lt;code&gt;pktap&lt;/code&gt; interface parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the tcpdump(1) man page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, to capture on more than one interface at a time, one may use ‚Äúpktap‚Äù as the interface parameter followed by an optional list of comma separated interface names to include. For example, to capture on the loopback and en0 interface:&lt;/p&gt;tcpdump -i pktap,lo0,en0&lt;p&gt;An interface argument of ‚Äúall‚Äù or ‚Äúpktap,all‚Äù can be used to capture packets from all interfaces, including loopback and tunnel interfaces. A pktap pseudo interface provides for packet metadata using the default PKTAP data link type and files are written in the Pcap-ng file format. The RAW data link type must be used to force to use the legacy pcap-savefile(5) file format with a ptkap pseudo interface. Note that captures on a ptkap pseudo interface will not be done in promiscuous mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, we just need something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tcpdump -i pktap,en0 -w outfile.pcapng&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tcptump -i pktap,all host 192.168.0.6 -w outfile.pcapng&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then open &lt;code&gt;outfile.pcapng&lt;/code&gt; in Wireshark and under Frame ‚Üí Process Information you can find the process name, PID, etc. (See screenshot above.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filtering can be done with &lt;code&gt;frame.darwin.process_info&lt;/code&gt; as listed here. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;frame.darwin.process_info.pname == "firefox"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;frame.darwin.process_info.pid == 92046&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is super helpful to figure out both what unexpected network traffic is being generated by and the inverse, what a process is doing on the network. And now thanks to Wireshark 4.6.0 it‚Äôs even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mysterious dark object in space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists detect the lowest mass dark object currently measured&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;To the point&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gravitational lenses: Distortions caused by gravitational lenses can be used to study the properties of dark matter, even though it does not emit light.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discovery: An international team has discovered a dark object in the distant universe that has one million times the mass of the Sun. The discovery is based on an analysis of the gravitational effects on the light from another galaxy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technology: A network of radio telescopes around the world, including the Green Bank Telescope, collected the data. It forms a virtual supertelescope that enables enhanced image quality, allowing even small gravitational signals to be detected.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark matter is an enigmatic form of matter not expected to emit light, yet it is essential to understanding how the rich tapestry of stars and galaxies we see in the night sky evolved. As a fundamental building block of the universe, a key question for astronomers is whether dark matter is smooth or clumpy, as this could reveal what it is made of. Since dark matter cannot be observed directly, its properties can only be determined by observing the gravitational lensing effect, whereby the light from a more distant object is distorted and deflected by the gravity of the dark object. ‚ÄúHunting for dark objects that do not seem to emit any light is clearly challenging,‚Äù said Devon Powell at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and lead author of the study. ‚ÄúSince we can‚Äôt see them directly, we instead use very distant galaxies as a backlight to look for their gravitational imprints.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team used a network of telescopes from around the world, including the Green Bank Telescope, the Very Long Baseline Array and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometric Network. The data from this international network were correlated at the Joint Institute for VLBI ERIC in the Netherlands, forming an Earth-sized super-telescope that could capture the subtle signals of gravitational lensing by the dark object. They found that the object has a mass that is a million times greater than that of our Sun and is located in a distant region of space, approximately 10 billion light years from Earth, when the universe was only 6.5 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the lowest mass object to be found using this technique, by a factor of about 100. To achieve this level of sensitivity, the team had to create a high-fidelity image of the sky using radio telescopes located around the world. John McKean from the University of Groningen, the University of Pretoria, and the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, who led the data collection and is the lead author of a companion paper, stated: ‚ÄúFrom the first high-resolution image, we immediately observed a narrowing in the gravitational arc, which is the tell-tale sign that we were onto something. Only another small clump of mass between us and the distant radio galaxy could cause this.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New modelling algorithms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyze the massive dataset, the team had to develop new modelling algorithms that could only be run on supercomputers. ‚ÄúThe data are so large and complex that we had to develop new numerical approaches to model them. This was not straightforward as it had never been done before,‚Äù said Simona Vegetti at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. ‚ÄúWe expect every galaxy, including our own Milky Way, to be filled with dark matter clumps, but finding them and convincing the community that they exist requires a great deal of number-crunching,‚Äù she continued. The team applied a special technique called gravitational imaging, which allowed them to ‚Äòsee‚Äô the invisible dark matter clump by mapping its gravitational lensing effect against the radio-luminous arc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGiven the sensitivity of our data, we were expecting to find at least one dark object, so our discovery is consistent with the so-called ‚Äòcold dark matter theory‚Äô on which much of our understanding of how galaxies form is based,‚Äù said Powell. ‚ÄúHaving found one, the question now is whether we can find more and whether their number will still agree with the models.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team is now analyzing the data further to better understand what the mysterious dark object could be, but they are also looking into other parts of the sky to see if they can find more examples of such low-mass dark objects using the same technique. If they continue to find such mysterious objects in other parts of the universe, and if they really turn out to be completely devoid of stars, then some theories of dark matter may be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Additional Information:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravitational lensing: This is an astrophysical tool used by astronomers to measure the mass properties of structures in the Universe. It is a consequence of Einstein‚Äôs Theory of General Relativity, where mass in the Universe curves space. If the mass of the foreground lensing object (typically a galaxy or cluster of galaxies) is sufficiently dense, then the light from distant objects is distorted and multiple images are even observed. In the case of this system, called B1938+666, the foreground infrared-luminous galaxy (seen at the centre of the ring), results in a beautiful Einstein ring of the distant galaxy. However, the distant galaxy is also bright at radio wavelengths, showing the beautiful multiple images and gravitational arcs (seen in red).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very Long Baseline Interferometry: The radio observations were taken using a combination of radio telescopes that are combined to form a so-called Very Long Baseline Interferometer. This observational method allows astronomers to improve the imaging sharpness of the data and reveal very small fluctuations in the brightness that otherwise could not be seen. For example, the resolving power of the data is a factor of 13 times better than the infrared imaging from the W. M. Keck Telescope adaptive optics system (also shown in the figures in black and white). The telescopes used in the observations were the Green Bank Telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the United States, and the telescopes of the European Very Long Baseline Interferometric Network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravitational imaging: This is a novel method that astronomers use to ‚Äòsee‚Äô mass in the Universe even though it does not emit any light. This method uses the extended gravitational arcs to look for small aberrations that can only be caused by an additional, invisible component of mass. By combining this method and the exquisite high angular resolution imaging from the data, the team was able to detect the presence of the lowest mass dark object currently measured.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla is in hot water in South Korea as nearly 4,500 of its electric vehicles have reported serious battery issues, putting their eligibility for government subsidies at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre receiving some troubling reports from South Korea today, as the Korea JoongAng Daily is reporting that a significant number of Tesla vehicles are experiencing battery failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue centers around a ‚ÄúBMS_a079 error,‚Äù a fault in the Battery Management System that is causing headaches for nearly 4,500 Tesla owners. This error, which has been reported in both Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, triggers a safety protocol that limits the battery‚Äôs maximum charge to 50%. This effectively cripples the vehicle‚Äôs range, posing a major inconvenience for owners who rely on their Teslas for daily driving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem has been escalating for some time and affects primarily 2021 vehicles, with a total of 4,637 reported cases in 4,351 cars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the exact numbers Tesla reportedly shared with Democratic Party lawmaker Park Sang-hyuk:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Total&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;One-time failure&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Two-time failure&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Three-time failure&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Four-time failure&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No. of cars&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,351&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,086&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;245&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No. of cases&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,637&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,086&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;490&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;57&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the problem has also been recurring after battery replacements in hundreds of cases, which some blame on Tesla using refurbished battery packs rather than new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the most part, Tesla was covering the repairs under warranty. But many of these vehicles are now out of warranty, as they sometimes exceed the maximum mileage. In those cases, owners are facing a staggering repair bill of over 30 million won (approximately $22,000) to get their cars back in working order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has, understandably, led to a growing chorus of angry customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As much as 22% of 2021 Model Ys and 12% of 2021 Model 3s in Korea are affected. This led people to believe that it had nothing to do with normal wear and tear, and it should be a recall for a defect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A civic group, the Citizens United for Consumer Sovereignty, is now demanding that Tesla Korea take responsibility for the issue. They are calling for a full-scale recall of all affected vehicles and a thorough investigation by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport to get to the root cause of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The situation has also caught the attention of the Korean government. The Environment Ministry has issued a stern warning to Tesla: fix the problem, or risk losing the lucrative government subsidies that have been a key driver of EV adoption in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A government official who handles EV subsidy programs told the Korea JoongAng Daily:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe have requested a clear response from Tesla Korea regarding the issue, but have yet to receive one. If the company continues to remain unresponsive, we will have no choice [but to consider suspending subsidies.] We cannot justify providing public funds for vehicles that disadvantage consumers.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current subsidy for EVs in South Korea can be up to 5.8 million won (approximately $3,950), which is a significant factor contributing to South Korea‚Äôs status as a key market for Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla has built a strong presence in South Korea, becoming the third-largest imported car brand by sales in 2024. However, this battery issue, coupled with the potential loss of subsidies, could significantly dent their market share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electrek‚Äôs Take&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a developing story, and we‚Äôll be keeping a close eye on how Tesla responds to this pressure from both the Korean government and its own customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by Anupreet Singh&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these are the kind of things that bring bad press to all EVs, not just Tesla. Oil lobby will not lose any time in pushing the narrative that battery technology is still not mature enough to be used by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not the first time that Tesla has been found to limit battery capacity and charging through a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it‚Äôs the first time that it has been linked to a large population of vehicles of a specific timeframe like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to know the root cause of this problem, as I don‚Äôt understand why it primarily affects South Korean owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My understanding is that most of Tesla‚Äôs vehicles sold in Korea are made at Gigafactory Shanghai in China, and that‚Äôs Tesla‚Äôs main export hub. Most of Tesla‚Äôs vehicles outside of the US are made in China. We should start seeing similar issues in other markets unless there‚Äôs a specific contributing factor in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Cortex Core Clerkship Grades and Transcript Normalization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear Applicants, Programs, and Medical Schools,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the opening of the residency recruitment season, we√¢ve heard your feedback on the Cortex Core Clerkship Transcript Normalization feature. As a physician-founded organization born out of our lived experience as applicants and program leaders, we understand the many emotions tied to the start of the season. We believe it is our duty and responsibility to communicate openly with all stakeholders about how our tools are used and how they may impact application review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We√¢ve Heard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past week, while the grades on transcripts and corresponding application documents have been accurate and fully accessible, we√¢ve received a small number of reports from the community about inaccuracies in a subset of automation-extracted grades displayed within Cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In each case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once confirmed, we corrected the extracted grade immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where the extracted grade was accurate, we provided feedback and guidance to the reporting program or school about its interpretation and the extraction methodology.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Cortex is now offered complimentary to all ERAS-participating programs through the AAMC-Thalamus collaboration, many programs are using it for the first time this season. We recognize the novelty of this feature may also be contributing to questions and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the Tool Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cortex makes accessible all application data including the medical school transcript, Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), and all other documents in their raw, original, and unaltered format.√Ç&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cortex uses automated extraction (optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP)) to parse clerkship grades from medical school transcripts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The software then generates reference reports including grades, percentiles, and graphical distributions allowing reviewers a structured way to contextualize grades for efficiency and comparison within and across medical schools.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First released in 2020, the tool is updated each recruitment cycle to reflect changes in grading schemas or transcript formatting.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Applicants cannot be filtered, searched, sorted, or auto-rejected based on any of the output. The automation-extracted grades and visualizations are provided for comparative context only.√Ç They are not included in any scoring or selection algorithms. Reviewers are strongly encouraged to verify all information against the applicant√¢s official PDF transcript. This reminder is also displayed directly within the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information, please review our supporting methodology documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Community Concerns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize the primary concern is that an inaccuracy could unfairly disadvantage an applicant in the selection process. While we understand how this may create unease, please note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tool is never intended to be used in isolation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We know from our experience working with the community that program directors employ a broader review of official application documentation in parallel, which may include medical school transcripts, the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), and other materials, all of which are readily available and accessible in Cortex.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In all investigated cases this season, to date, program directors correctly identified the accurate grade when reviewing alongside the official record.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Guidelines and Recommendations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;For Programs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continue to use Transcript Normalization as a reference, not as a stand-alone decision tool.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify grades through the official transcript and MSPE, which remain fully accessible within Cortex in the following locations:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Applicant summary page: a) score drawer, b) √¢View Transcript√¢ links&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Applicant details page: a) score drawer, b) left-side navigation menu, and c) documents section.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If desired, use the √¢blinder√¢ feature for √¢clerkship grades√¢ to hide all grades, percentiles, and graphs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;For Applicants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your official transcript, MSPE, and application documents are and have always been correct and unaltered in our system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In all reported instances, program directors identified and corrected any discrepancies using the official documents.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is not recommended to contact programs about your transcript; Official documents may be viewed directly by directors and other faculty reviewers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;For Medical Schools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Please share this guidance with your applicants to help reduce confusion and anxiety.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assure students that program directors and faculty regularly review official records as part of standard application review practices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where your grading system is unique or particularly complex, we welcome your collaboration in helping refine mappings and reduce ambiguity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct any program or applicant inquiries about grade accuracy to Thalamus Support, so we can investigate promptly and provide clarity.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our Commitment to the Community&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to emphasize that we are listening closely to your feedback, and we value the partnership of applicants, programs, and medical schools in this process. Each recruitment season brings its own set of questions, adjustments, and improvements √¢ and this is expected as the community adapts to tools and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our team is committed to continuous improvement of Cortex based on your feedback. The purpose of Cortex Transcript Normalization tool has always been to provide additional context, not to replace official documents or holistic review. The feature continues to function as intended this year, as it has historically. With your input, we will keep advancing the system through additional validation and improvement to support the community as the use of Cortex expands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We appreciate your trust and collaboration as we work together toward a more consistent, fair, and efficient recruitment experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, we analyze the security of Telegram‚Äôs end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protocol in presence of mass-surveillance. Specifically, we show &amp;gt;that Telegram‚Äôs E2EE protocol is susceptible to fairly efficient algorithm substitution attacks. While official Telegram clients should be protected against this type of attack due their open-source nature and reproducible builds, this could potentially lead to a very efficient state sponsored surveillance of private communications over Telegram, either on individuals through a targeted attack or massively through some compromised third-party clients. We provide an efficient algorithm substitution attack against MTProto2.0 ‚Äî the underlying authenticated encryption scheme ‚Äî that recovers significant amount of encryption key material with a very high probability with few queries and fairly low latency. This could potentially lead to a very efficient state sponsored surveillance of private communications over Telegram, either through a targeted attack or a compromised third-party app. Our attack exploits MTProto2.0‚Äôs degree of freedom in choosing the random padding length and padding value. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that Telegram should revise MTProto2.0‚Äôs padding methodology. In particular, we show that a minor change in the padding description of MTProto2.0 makes it subversion-resistant in most of the practical scenarios. As a side-effect, we generalize the underlying mode of operation in MTProto2.0, as MTProto-G, and show that this generalization is a multi-user secure deterministic authenticated encryption scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Published&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Issue&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Section&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;License&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright (c) 2023 Beno√Æt Cogliati, Jordan Ethan, Ashwin Jha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Swarm reveals growing weak spot in Earth's magnetic field&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Gaby Clark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;scientific editor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Robert Egan&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Using 11 years of magnetic field measurements from the European Space Agency's Swarm satellite constellation, scientists have discovered that the weak region in Earth's magnetic field over the South Atlantic‚Äîknown as the South Atlantic Anomaly‚Äîhas expanded by an area nearly half the size of continental Europe since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earth's magnetic field is vital to life on our planet. It is a complex and dynamic force that protects us from cosmic radiation and charged particles from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is largely generated by a global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron that makes up the outer core around 3000 km beneath our feet. Acting like a spinning conductor in a bicycle dynamo, it creates electrical currents, which in turn, generate our continuously changing electromagnetic field‚Äîbut in reality the processes that generate the field are far more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swarm, an Earth Explorer mission developed under ESA's Earth Observation FutureEO program, comprises a constellation of three identical satellites that precisely measure the magnetic signals that stem from Earth's core, mantle, crust and oceans, as well as from the ionosphere and magnetosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to this exceptional mission, scientists are gaining more insight into the different sources of magnetism to help understand how and why the magnetic field is weakening in some places and strengthening in others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weak field South Atlantic Anomaly was first identified southeast of South America back in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the South Atlantic Anomaly is of particular interest for space safety, as satellites passing over the region are faced with higher doses of incoming radiation. This can lead to malfunctions or damage to critical hardware, and even blackouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published in Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, the latest results from the Swarm mission reveal that while the South Atlantic Anomaly expanded steadily between 2014 and 2025, a region of the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Africa has experienced an even faster weakening of Earth's magnetic field since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block," says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark. "It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This behavior is linked to strange patterns in the magnetic field at the boundary between Earth's liquid outer core and its rocky mantle, known as reverse flux patches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prof. Finlay explains, "Normally we'd expect to see magnetic field lines coming out of the core in the southern hemisphere. But beneath the South Atlantic Anomaly we see unexpected areas where the magnetic field, instead of coming out of the core, goes back into the core. Thanks to the Swarm data, we can see one of these areas moving westward over Africa, which contributes to the weakening of the South Atlantic Anomaly in this region."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Swarm's record-breaking 11 years&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest model of Earth's core-generated magnetic field marks a new milestone for ESA's Swarm satellites, which have now provided the longest continuous record of magnetic field measurements from space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The satellites were launched on 22 November 2013 as the fourth Earth Explorer mission, pioneering satellites that form a key component of ESA's forward-looking FutureEO program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conceived as demonstrators of innovative Earth observation technologies, these missions have long outlived their original design lifetime, become integral to long-term records, provided data for critical operational services, and have paved the way for future generations of satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swarm data underpin the global magnetic models used for navigation, monitor space weather hazards, and allow unprecedented insights into our Earth system from its core through to the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Earth's magnetic field strengthens over Siberia&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest Swarm results highlight the dynamic nature of Earth's magnetism. For example, in the southern hemisphere there is one point where the magnetic field is particularly strong, and in the northern hemisphere there are two‚Äîone around Canada and the other around Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When you're trying to understand Earth's magnetic field, it's important to remember that it's not just a simple dipole, like a bar magnet. It's only by having satellites like Swarm that we can fully map this structure and see it changing," said Prof. Finlay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, since Swarm has been in orbit, the magnetic field over Siberia has strengthened while it has weakened over Canada. The Canadian strong field region has shrunk by 0.65% of Earth's surface area, which is almost the size of India, while the Siberian region has grown by 0.42% of Earth's surface area, which is comparable to the size of Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shift, which is caused by complex processes going on in Earth's turbulent core, is associated with the northern magnetic pole moving towards Siberia in recent years. This shift is important for navigation, which is affected by the dance between these two areas of strong magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ESA's Swarm Mission Manager, Anja Stromme, said, "It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries. The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Hold Off on Litestream 0.5.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litestream is an open-source tool that backs up SQLite databases to cloud storage in real time. I love it and use it in all of my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litestream is owned by Fly.io, and they paused development on Litestream for almost two years in favor of an alternative project called LiteFS. Two weeks ago, Ben Johnson, Litestream‚Äôs creator and lead developer, announced that they were shifting focus back to Litestream and had just published a new release, 0.5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried out Litestream 0.5.0, but I caution other Litestream users to give it another release and more extensive testing before deploying it in production. I had a bumpy experience migrating to the new version of Litestream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The expected migration work üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two tasks that are intentional in upgrading from previous versions of Litestream to v0.5.0 and above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The backup format has changed, so Litestream 0.5.0 cannot restore from backups created in previous versions of Litestream.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;litestream.yml&lt;/code&gt;configuration file format has changed slightly. There used to be an array field called&lt;code&gt;replicas&lt;/code&gt;, but 0.5.0 changes this to a dictionary called&lt;code&gt;replica&lt;/code&gt;(singular).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litestream has published a helpful migration guide with more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of Litestream 0.5.0 is that there‚Äôs now an official litestream Docker image. All of my previous Docker containers required a lot of boilerplate to download the correct version of Litestream and make it available in my container, but now it reduces to a single Dockerfile line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;COPY --from=litestream/litestream:0.5.0 /usr/local/bin/litestream /app/litestream
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My test migration to Litestream 0.5.0 üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test out Litestream 0.5.0, I tried deploying it on my project, What Got Done. This is a good project for testing because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I already announced that I was shutting down this service, so users have stopped using the site.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The server kept failing due to a bug in Litestream 0.3.13 that was fixed in 0.5.0.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Uploading to Backblaze backends no longer works üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start the migration, I downloaded the latest copy of my data using Litestream 0.3.13 and then tried to use Litestream 0.5.0 to upload it back to Backblaze‚Äôs cloud storage in Litestream‚Äôs new format. But I hit this error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;error" db=store.db replica=s3 error="write ltx file: s3: upload to db/0000/0000000000000001-0000000000000001.ltx: operation error S3: PutObject, resolve auth scheme: resolve endpoint: endpoint rule error, Custom endpoint `s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com` was not a valid URI"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same replica definition had worked in previous versions, so I was a bit puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;access-key-id: ${LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
secret-access-key: ${LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
dbs:
  - path: ${DB_PATH}
    replica:
      url: s3://${LITESTREAM_BUCKET}/db
      endpoint: ${LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried several alternative ways of specifying the Backblaze S3 endpoint, but Litestream rejected them all as configuration errors before even attempting to back up. The configuration I had was the only one that Litestream accepted as valid configuration, but it failed to back up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I filed Backblaze replica fails with ‚ÄúCustom endpoint &amp;amp;mldr; was not a valid URI‚Äù #789, and Litestream developer Cory LaNou fixed it the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I was able to upload data to Backblaze in Litestream‚Äôs new format, I was unblocked from integrating Litestream 0.5.0 into What Got done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-if-replica-exists&lt;/code&gt; disappeared üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deployed Litestream 0.5.0 to What Got Done, but the server failed to boot with this error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;flag provided but not defined: -if-replica-exists
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked the command documentation, and it said that &lt;code&gt;-if-replica-exists&lt;/code&gt; was still supported:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ litestream restore -help | grep if-replica-exists --after-context=1
        -if-replica-exists
            Returns exit code of 0 if no backups found.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that the flag was removed by mistake and will be back in 0.5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Restore fails with &lt;code&gt;transaction not available&lt;/code&gt; üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undeterred by the loss of &lt;code&gt;-if-replica-exists&lt;/code&gt;, I removed it from my start script. But then my server failed to start with a new error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;level=ERROR msg="failed to run" error="cannot calc restore plan: transaction not available"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That turns out to match this open Litestream issue, with an alarming severity of ‚ÄúCRITICAL - Complete Data Loss‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Litestream no longer creates directories üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I was just willing to try anything to get back up and running, so I ran the latest bleeding edge version of Litestream by building it from source in my Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the latest version got around whatever &lt;code&gt;transaction not available&lt;/code&gt; issue I was hitting, and Litestream made it further in the process!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there was still one error to overcome:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;level=ERROR msg="failed to run" error="create temp database path: open /app/data/store.db.tmp: no such file or directory"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one was actually simple enough that I had a pretty strong suspicion about what was happening. In previous versions of Litestream, if I told it to restore a SQLite database to &lt;code&gt;/app/data/store.db&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;/app/data&lt;/code&gt; path didn‚Äôt exist, Litestream would attempt to create it before writing the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked the source and saw that the folder creation logic had disappeared in this code flow, but it was simple enough to fix, so I created a fix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Success! üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With my fork of Litestream with the final &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt; fix applied, What Got Done was back up and running!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reflections üîóÔ∏é&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was able to get Litestream 0.5.x working with a pre-release fork, but I‚Äôm going to hold off deploying it to my other projects for another release or two. The 0.5.0 changes seem to have been more disruptive than the Litestream folks expected, and they‚Äôre still struggling with some serious bugs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CRITICAL: Restore fails with ‚Äônonsequential page numbers‚Äô after checkpoint during Litestream downtime #752&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local LTX Level 0 files are never compacted/removed #784&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there are several other serious bugs that they‚Äôve fixed in the development version but are not yet in a production release:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restore does not update LTX ID information #781&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Age encryption configuration silently ignored in v0.5.0+ #790&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[Regression] LTX transactions get deleted in 0.5.0, cannot restore more than a few seconds #771&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
