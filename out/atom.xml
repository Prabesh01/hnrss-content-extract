    &lt;p&gt;Spring is here and the nettles are growing again so I decided it was time to make a meal out of them. Most people know that stinging nettles are pesky green plants that irritate the skin when you touch them. What you probably don’t know is that they’re a nutritious source of iron, calcium, potassium, and silica as well as vitamins A, B, C, and K1. Stinging nettles also have anti-inflammatory properties and can relieve arthritis and rheumatism. They can be turned into soups, curries, and risottos (some recipes here) and you can get them completely free from practically everywhere in Britain over the summer. You’ve likely even got some in your garden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you collect them you need to wear gloves because they sting. The advantage of this is it allows you to make sure you’re collecting the right thing. If you’re unsure, just touch one and see whether it hurts which is exactly what I did. It hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The even look a bit scary with their toothy-edged leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got them inside, boil them in water for a few minutes and this will stop them stinging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re having stinging nettle risotto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People think that when you become vegan you have to give up lots of food. It’s true that I stopped eating animals but the number of different species I eat has grown considerably. This is because meat-eaters tend to eat the same few species of animals over and over again – pigs, cows, chickens. Whereas there are some 20,000 species of edible plants in the world. Meat also tends to fill you up. Indeed I’ve been to dinner with people where all they have on their plate is a slab of meat and nothing else. Whereas as a vegan (with the exception of a shitty Spanish restaurant that served me a plate of artichokes and nothing else) I eat a huge variety of species. Meat-eaters can eat these too but they often don’t because meat is so filling.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I analyzed the lineups at the world's most popular nightclubs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years back I did a bit of dance music related data visualization over at Lazily Evaluated. My favourite was an analysis of clubs and their lineups using Resident Advisor / RA data, I called it Clubster Analysis. I always wanted to dig into the technical aspects of gathering the data, analyzing it and building the charts and graphs to tell a story and give people insight. With this blog I now have the right venue for that kind of tech talk, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data gathering #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To visualize data, first you have to get some! For this purpose I wrote a little scraper in Python. I used Beautiful Soup to parse the html and grab the bits and pieces I was interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My scraping of a few thousand pages didn’t cause considerable load on the RA servers. But in the age of overzealous AI scrapers it’s worth being polite, so I throttled according to their robots.txt. I also maintained a local cache of html files I had already downloaded, so that I wouldn’t have fetch the same data repeatedly (past lineups are unlikely to change after the fact) just because I discovered some bug or error in my parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order I scraped in was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get the 20 most popular regions in RA (and then I dropped “Streamland” which was a pandemic era pseudo-region)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch the most popular clubs and some related metadata for all of those regions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each club, get the lineups for every 2019 event of theirs (the last full year before the pandemic started).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Save the results to csv files&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clean up, verification and Analysis #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did some spot checks to verify that my parsing was working as I expected and added tests to make sure I handled edge cases and normalized artist names. There was a lot of variance in how dates were formatted, how artists were linked, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that I analyzed the data. I built one big table/dataframe in Pandas by joining all the info from the csv files. Then I calculated the similarities between each pair of clubs in the data set using the Jaccard index. Consider all the artists that have played at two given clubs, take the intersection (number of artists that have featured in lineups at both clubs) over the union (all the artists that have performed at one or the other). As an example if Club A had 100 artists booked and Club B had 100 artists, and they had 10 bookings in common, the Jaccard index would be 10/190 = ~5%. This gives you a good way to compare large and small clubs and balances large and small lineups (some of the clubs have multiple rooms with very long events, others have one dj playing in one room all night long once a week).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the Jaccard index we can build a graph, using NetworkX from all the clubs. The edges between two nodes are weighted by the similarity of those clubs. On top of the graph we run community detection to create clusters (hence the clubster name). This gives us a rough idea of which clubs are most similar, that is to say, have similar tastes in their bookings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the year 2019, there were 131 clubs in the data set with 8.502 events. There were 9.405 unique artists making up 30.482 individual bookings. This means that the average artist in the dataset was booked 3.24 times at those clubs in that year and the average event had 3.5 artists on the line up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a whole, out of 8.515 possible pairs of clubs, 3.716 pairs had some overlap in their bookings and out of those the average overlap was 1%. This was lower than I thought, the bookings at European clubs felt more homogenous to me, but I suppose they book a lot of artists. It would be interesting to get more data, recent and historic, and see how this has evolved through time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Visualization #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was my first time using D3 to draw charts. There was a bit of a learning curve, in earlier projects I had used higher level charting libraries which have simpler apis. But with D3 you get a lot of control over how your charts look and behave which I think I used to good effect in this instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main goal was to visualize the clusters and to allow people to interact with the clubs. I coloured the clubs according to their clusters and sized them based on the number of followers they had on RA. I played around with the gravity and placement of the cluster, trying to find a balance that worked on different screen sizes as well as being a fair portrayal of the different communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then did some scrollytelling to tell the story of the data, as I saw it, while the reader scrolls down the page. But I also added filters and interactivity for people to explore and see if they agree with my telling of the story or if they can find one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time I didn’t find any great React and D3 bridges, so it was a bit of a hassle getting the React components to play nice with the D3 graph, but in the end I was able to connect the two with &lt;code&gt;createRef&lt;/code&gt; to the D3 svg component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the clustering I looked into the “resident factor”, how many times an artist was booked at a club repeatedly compared to all the one offs. This was lower than expected, most of these clubs were booking a constantly rotating assembly of talent, residents don’t play as big a part as I would have thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transitioning between the different sections of these graphs was one of my favourite parts. Seeing the clusters morph into dots and candlestick charts (and back again) was oddly satisfying. Took a lot of tweaking, but I think it really tied together the scrollytelling experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think these transitions would have been possible with the higher level charting libraries I’d used previously. So the decision to go with D3 felt justified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a great pandemic project that combined web scraping, data analysis, and interactive visualization to explore the global dance music club scene. I learned me some D3 for the visualization, got better at doing cartesian graphing calculations in my head and learned about the underlying svg mechanics that power those graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results surprised me: despite my perceived homogeneity of European club bookings, only 1% average overlap between venues suggested more diverse landscape than I expected. The diminished role of residents compared to one-off bookings also challenged my assumptions about how these clubs operate. For the story telling maintaining the balance between a narrative and letting users explore and decide for themselves was a fun challenge. I think these sort of passion projects can give us deep insights into our world and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technical stack I worked with: Python, Pandas, NetworkX, D3, and React proved powerful despite some integration challenges. The complete project is available on GitHub and you can explore the live interactive visualization yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun building this and am proud of the result. If you’re working on cultural data analysis, need help with web scraping and visualization, or just want to discuss interesting datasets, feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;auraphone: a simple app to collect people's info at events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Andrew, and I'm building Auraphone, a simple app to collect people's info at events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been a developer for many years and I thought I knew bluetooth well. I was an early employee of the scooter company Bird back in 2017 and wrote a lot of the ios and android bluetooth to "bird brain" logic. But I started a new bluetooth app that is a lot more complex. Imagine a room full of people at a big networking event. Every phone broadcasts a bluetooth service and every phone tries and connects, all at the same time! I'm building this app to bring networking events into the year 2026! We all have bluetooth phones with us, lets use them to solve this who is going to give who their phone number issue. Here is what it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You set your name, photo, and what info you want to share. Maybe just your instagram username, maybe your email and linked in too, your choice what to broadcast.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Walk around your networking event and collect all this info from people you are in close range to.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have a record of everyone you actually meet IRL at this event.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here is a video demo:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of the term "peripheral" as server and "central" as client. Yes there are differences in bluetooth and there are reasons for those terms, but my life got much easier working on this app when I started just thinking client server. So in a room with just two phones, which one is which? It can't be a coin toss. If 50% of the time both phones act as the server and neither client, bad. Or if both phones act as clients, bad. So how do you break the tie? You start up your server AND you act as a client looking for servers to connect to. Just be careful not to connect to yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With bluetooth your server advertises and when you connect it tells you what characteristics it has. Think of characteristics as "endpoints". They are not the same as an http endpoints at all but again my life got easier when I started thinking of them like this. Our app has two characteristics PROFILE_CHAR and PHOTO_CHAR and step one is a client hits PROFILE_CHAR endpoint and gets back json from the other phone with device_id, first_name, photo_hash, instagram and it doesn't have to be json. It could be Protocol Buffers and binary but again, I went with json and yes, easier life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So with my 200 OK from PROFILE_CHAR endpoint I look at the photo_hash which is a 256 sha from the binary data of the image the user picked. If I have this file already cached, I'm good and I disconnect from this server. If not I hit the PHOTO_CHAR endpoint and get this image data and save as hash.jpg locally. And then I disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After I disconnect from a server I place that specific bluetooth server id on a cooldown list. I have other phones in the room I need to connect with! And all this time I'm also acting as a server myself. Well, sometimes. Sometimes when I'm busy being a client getting a photo I'll pause my server actions. And it depends on ios vs android. There is lots of complexity in the BLE (bluetooth low energy) stack. This loop of find a server, connect, get my info, disconnect, repeat is a great little loop. But there are limits and GATT errors and queue buffers that get full and MTU (max transmission unit) that can make it so two phones right next to each other take a while before they finally find each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I made github.com/andrewarrow/auraphone-blue which is a BLE stack simulator all written in golang. If you look at the wire package you'll see a pretty complete BLE implementation using the file system and domain sockets to mock the bluetooth radio. The swift package and kotlin package should look very familiar to anyone who has worked on ios or android BLE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My plan was to run many mock phones this way and test all the weird BLE differences between ios and android here. It did not work. The only thing this golang auraphone-blue repo did for me was really help me understand how bluetooth works. This BLE stack that I made in golang doesn't help me fix ios and android bugs, it only introduces its own subtle golang filesystem ble bugs!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end nothing fixed all the bugs better than just running two real ios phones and two real android phones and having them write to disk very thorough logs PLUS ble specific json files showing exactly what each operation was doing and what info it got back. I ended up writing logic to zip up the entire local directory of the phone with all these files and logs and doing an HTTP POST to my local mac just to get all the data off all 4 phones quickly after each run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it's not like this app will keep running when you have your phone in your pocket. iOS has rules on bluetooth connections and it's basically only if your app is running and foreground. So the way I see auraphone working at an event, you walk around and mingle as normal but yeah every one has their phone out and running the app but ONLY this app. You are still present and in the conversation not just looking at other distractions from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now effortlessly after your conversation is done and you move around the room, you have a record of who that person was! Also the list is sorted by last updated_at desc so whoever you are near will be at the top. Great for when you have met someone earlier that night but forget their name. Now you just look down at your auraphone app that's already out and running and say oh hey jessie!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is in the ios app store. For android we serve up the apk at auraphone.apk. We are testing it now at BLANKSPACES Culver City. Looking to try it now in a room full of people! Give me reports of did your phones see each other? Did the contact info sync? Did it solve a problem for you?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Archive.today: FBI Demands Data from Provider Tucows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mysterious website Archive.today is coming under the FBI's crosshairs. A court order is forcing the provider Tucows to hand over user data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is one of the most mysterious and, at the same time, best-known websites on the internet. Archive.today has built up a user base over a period of more than ten years who use the service to access previous snapshots of a web page. So basically like the Wayback Machine of the Internet Archive, only largely free of rules and presumably therefore also anonymous. To the chagrin of the media industry, the service is also often used to bypass paywalls. This is also possible because the service does not adhere to common rules and laws and offers no opt-out option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so far, the operators have gotten away with it. Although there have been minor problems in the history of the service occasionally, for example, a top-level domain operator denied them further use of one of the many archive domains. However, the operation of the project, which is allegedly financed by donations and own funds, was not seriously endangered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Court Order in the USA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now the operators of archive.today are apparently fearing bigger trouble. In recent months and years, they had become noticeably quieter. Until two years ago, for example, questions were regularly answered in the blog. In the official X account, which had been silent for over a year, a new post appeared at the end of October new post. “Canary,” it said there, along with a URL. The mentioned canary bird is likely an allusion to an old custom in mining. A canary brought along warned the miners when it keeled over dead about the threat of invisible gas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videos by heise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deadly danger that the site operators fear is apparently linked to the PDF linked in the X post linked PDF. It contains a court order that the US investigative authority FBI has obtained. It instructs the Canadian provider Tucows to hand over comprehensive data about the customer behind archive.today. It concerns address and connection data as well as payment information. If Tucows does not provide the data, penalties are threatened. Whether the court order is genuine and how the operators of the site obtained it could not be verified so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is the operator based in Russia?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the FBI is currently interested in archive.today, which is also accessible under the domains archive.is and archive.ph, is not evident from the court order. However, there are several obvious starting points for investigations: in addition to the obvious reason of copyright issues, the investigators could also be pursuing suspicions about unclear financing, the origin of the operators, or the technical approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Finnish blogger Janni Patokallio compiled various clues and research results in a post in a post. According to this, Archive.today uses a botnet with changing IP addresses to circumvent anti-scraping measures. There are also indications that the operator(s) are based in Russia. Another private investigation from 2024 comes to a different conclusion. It names a software developer from New York as the alleged operator. According to this investigation, following the trail to Eastern Europe proved to be a red herring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(mki)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;👋🏽 HN,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t a pitch, it’s a story. If you want to see the quick ‘what’s this thing do’ videos go to intraview.ai home page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s always been a challenge for me to maintain a mental model of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI and agentic development is accelerating the problem of maintaining a systems model that allows us to make good design decisions. The more code we create, the more we need to review and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long poles in the software development lifecycle that have a lot of room for improvement are comprehension &amp;amp; alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How does it work now?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How should it work?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Where should we go next?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How do we get there?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s becoming abundantly clear that commoditizing coding is not commoditizing software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stepping aside to speak to my own interests —&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I don’t want to lose touch with how it works. I feel a lot of builders love solving the puzzles. When I say that, I’m not talking about writing code, I’m talking about shaping the solution, testing the solution, and improving it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The loop of shaping the product is my joy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, we can all benefit with a hand making code more accessible — whether it’s the code you forgot you wrote last week, your colleagues PR, an open source repo or the Agent who just built something while you got coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My solution is called Intraview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a VS Code extension (Yes, forks like Cursor too) that works with your existing Agent (Claude, GPT5-codex) via a local MCP to build visual tours. The tours can act as guided feedback sessions, as well, where you can review some work by an Agent or a PR with added context by the Agent on how things work. It’s secure-by-design, with the only external calls being some basic anonymous usage telemetry to Azure logging to help me understand what features to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it’s better to show than tell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created a walkthrough where I show how I pull down an Open Source repo (Plotly JS), install Intraview, create a code Tour to get me started with learning how to build a new visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also show how the tool helps with giving agents feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not a polished marketing video, there is no flashy hook, I assume you’ve read this and I don’t lead with why. It’s pretty raw outside of some speed-ups to spare you from my bad decision to choose a Repo that’s 1.5GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scene opens as all great stories with a Terminal and a GitHub page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m grateful that you’ve come this far to engage with this work and hope you’ll take the next step to help me shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me help you build and enjoy it a little more than you did yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enjoy and, please, tell me what you think on HackerNews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— Cy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in following my progress, find me on LinkedIn (I don’t use any other networks).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We have been hard at work to bring the Swift toolchain to FreeBSD. A preview Swift bundle for FreeBSD 14.3+ is available at https://download.swift.org/tmp-ci-nightly/development/freebsd-14_ci_latest.tar.gz. The bundle contains a Swift development compiler and Swift runtimes needed for compiling Swift programs on, and for, FreeBSD 14 on &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt; machines.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dependencies&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Swift compiler and runtimes have a few dependencies. Please install the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;zlib-ng&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;python3&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;sqlite3&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;libuuid&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;curl&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Known Issues&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The compiler in the bundle is still under development and isn't part of a release yet and we're not quite done porting everything to FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of known issues that you may run into while trying things out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Thread sanitizer reports incorrect failures &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;LLDB is unable to execute Swift expressions &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Command Plugins in a SwiftPM package hangs &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Using standard types with C++ interop results in an undefined voidify symbol &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Importing the C libraries is done through "Glibc". This will change to &lt;code&gt;import FreeBSD&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;lld&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lldb&lt;/code&gt; depend on &lt;code&gt;libxml2.so.2&lt;/code&gt;, which is not be available in the system package manager.

&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are investigating adding aarch64 support and making the bundle available for all minor versions of FreeBSD 14.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As you find more bugs, please file issues at https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We look forward to hearing your feedback. If you're interested in helping add the finishing polish, please feel free to reach out here on the forums.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Yes, the FreeBSD stability policy appears to be within a major version. The bundle is built for FreeBSD 14. I'm glad to see that you were able to find a workaround though.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For -STABLE branches, it's important to make sure that ABI is compatible across dot releases (in other words, user can expect applications that is compiled for X.0 would run without modification on any X.y releases). We also try to maintain ABI compatibility across .0 releases, but they are not strictly enforced except for libraries that already implements versioned symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, I would expect the Swift compatibility policy for FreeBSD to be similar to that of Linux. We distribute toolchains for e.g. Ubuntu 22 and Ubuntu 24 that are distinct. @etcwilde that sounds right, I hope?&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate whether LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling, whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly. Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward "easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: William Gitta Lugoloobi [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Mon, 20 Oct 2025 22:48:23 UTC (1,102 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;I hate hyperbolic news headlines about data breaches, but for the "2 Billion Email Addresses" headline to be hyperbolic, it'd need to be exaggerated or overstated - and it isn't. It's rounded up from the more precise number of 1,957,476,021 unique email addresses, but other than that, it's exactly what it sounds like. Oh - and 1.3 billion unique passwords, 625 million of which we'd never seen before either. It's the most extensive corpus of data we've ever processed, by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about the 183M unique email addresses that Synthient had indexed in their threat intelligence platform and then shared with us. I explained that this was only part of the corpus of data they'd indexed, and that it didn't include the credential stuffing records. Stealer log data is obtained by malware running on infected machines. In contrast, credential stuffing lists usually originate from other data breaches where email addresses and passwords are exposed. They're then bundled up, sold, redistributed, and ultimately used to log in to victims' accounts. Not just the accounts they were initially breached from, either, because people reuse the same password over and over again, the data from one breach is frequently usable on completely unrelated sites. A breach of a forum to comment on cats often exposes data that can then be used to log in to the victim's shopping, social media and even email accounts. In that regard, credential stuffing data becomes "the keys to the castle".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me run through how we verified the data, what you can do about it and for the tech folks, some of the hoops we had to jump through to make processing this volume of data possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data Verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first person whose data I verified was easy - me 😔 An old email address I've had since the 90s has been in credential stuffing lists before, so it wasn't too much of a surprise. Furthermore, I found a password associated with my address, which I'd definitely used many eons ago, and it was about as terrible as you'd expect from that era. However, none of the other passwords associated with my address were familiar. They certainly looked like passwords that other people might have feasibly used, but I'm pretty sure they weren't mine. One was even just an IP address from Perth on the other side of the country, which is both infeasible as a password I would have used, yet eerily close to home. I mean, of all the places in the world an IP address could have appeared from, it had to be somewhere in my own country I've been many times before...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving on to HIBP subscribers, I reached out to a handful and asked for support verifying the data. I chose a mix of subscribers with many who'd never been involved in any data breach we'd ever seen before; my experience above suggested that there's recycled data in there, and we had previously verified that when investigating those other incidents. However, is the all-new stuff legitimate? The very first response I received was exactly what I was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;#1 is an old password that I don't use anymore. #2 is a more recent password. Thanks for the heads up, I've gone and changed the password for every critical account that used either one.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perfectly illustrating most people's behaviour with passwords, #2 referred to above was just #1 with two exclamation marks at the end!! (Incidentally, these were simple six and eight-character passwords, and neither of them was in Pwned Passwords either.) He had three passwords in total, which also means one of them, like with my data, was not familiar. However, the most important thing here is that this example perfectly illustrates why we put the effort into processing data like this: #2 was a real, live password that this guy was actively using, and it was sitting right next to his email address, being passed around among criminals. However, through this effort, that credential pair has now become useless, which is precisely what we're aiming for with this exercise, just a couple of billion times over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second respondent only had one password against their address:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Yes that was a password I used for many years for what I would call throw away or unimportant accounts between 20 and 10 years ago&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was also only eight characters, but this time, we'd seen it in Pwned Passwords many times before. And the observation about the password's age was consistent with my own records, so there's definitely some pretty old data in there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following response was not at all surprising:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I am familiar with that password... I used it almost 10 years ago... and cannot recall the last time I used it.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was on a corporate account, too, and the owner of the address duly forwarded my email to the cybersecurity team for further investigation. The single password associated with this lady's email address had a massive nine characters, and also hadn't previously appeared in Pwned Passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next up was a respondent who replied inline to my questions, so I'll list them below with the corresponding answers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Is this familiar? Yes&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Have you ever used it in the past? Yes and is still on some accounts I do not use any longer.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;And if so, how long ago? Unfortunately, it is still on some active accounts that I have just made a list of to change or close immediately.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This individual's eight-character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and a "special" character also wasn't in Pwned Passwords. Similarly, as with the earlier response, that password was still in active use, posing a real risk to the owner. It would pass most password complexity criteria and slip through any service using Pwned Passwords to block bad ones, so again, this highlights why it was so important for us to process the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next person had three different passwords against rows with their email address, and they came back with a now common response:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Yes, these are familiar, last used 10 years ago&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'd actually seen all three of them in Pwned Passwords before, many times each. Another respondent with precisely the kind of gamer-like passwords you'd expect a kid to use (one of which we hadn't seen before), also confirmed (I think?) their use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;maybe when i was a kid lol&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responses that weren't an emphatic "yes, that's my data" were scarce. The two passwords against one person's name were both in Pwned Passwords (albeit only once each), yet it's entirely possible that neither of them had been used by this specific individual before. It's also possible they'd forgotten a password they'd used more than a decade ago, or it may have even been automatically assigned to them by the service that was subsequently breached. Put it down as a statistical anomaly, but I thought it was worth mentioning to highlight that being in this data set isn't a guarantee of a genuine password of yours being exposed. If your email address is found in this corpus then that's real, of course, so there must be some truth in the data, but it's a reminder that when data is aggregated from so many different sources over such a long period of time, there's going to be some inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Searching Pwned Passwords&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a brief recap, we load passwords into the service we call Pwned Passwords. When we do so, there is absolutely no association between the password and the email address it appeared next to. This is for both your protection and ours; can you imagine if HIBP was pwned? It's not beyond the realm of possibility, and the impact of exposing billions of credential pairs that can immediately unlock an untold number of accounts would be catastrophic. It's highly risky, and completely unnecessary when you can search for standalone passwords anyway without creating the risk of it being linked back to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it: if you have a password of "Fido123!" and you find it's been previously exposed (which it has), it doesn't matter if it was exposed against your email address or someone else's; it's still a bad password because it's named after your dog followed by a very predictable pattern. If you have a genuinely strong password and it's in Pwned Passwords, then you can walk away with some confidence that it really was yours. Either way, you shouldn't ever use that password again anywhere, and Pwned Passwords has done its job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking the service is easy, anonymous and depending on your level of technical comfort, can be done in several different ways. Here's a copy and paste from the last Synthient blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the Pwned Passwords search page. Passwords are protected with an anonymity model, so we never see them (it's processed in the browser itself), but if you're wary, just check old ones you may suspect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the k-anonymity API. This is what drives the page in the previous point, and if you're handy with writing code, this is an easy approach and gives you complete confidence in the anonymity aspect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use 1Password's Watchtower. The password manager has a built-in checker that uses the abovementioned API and can check all the passwords in your vault. (Disclosure: 1Password is a regular sponsor of this blog, and has product placement on HIBP.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My vested interest in 1Password aside, Watchtower is the easiest, fastest way to understand your potential exposure in this incident. And in case you're wondering why I have so many vulnerable and reused passwords, it's a combination of the test accounts I've saved over the years and the 4-digit PINs some services force you to use. Would you believe that every single 4-digit number ever has been pwned?! (If you're interested, the ABC has a fantastic infographic using a heatmap based on HIBP data that shows some very predictable patterns for 4-digit PINs.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;This Is Not a Gmail Breach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It pains me to say it, but I have to, given the way the stealer logs made ridiculous, completely false headlines a couple of weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has suddenly gained *way* more traction in recent hours, and something I thought was obvious needs clarifying: this *is not* a Gmail leak, it simply has the credentials of victims infected with malware, and Gmail is the dominant email provider: https://t.co/S75hF4T1es&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) October 27, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 32 million different email domains in this latest corpus, of which gmail.com is one. It is, of course, the largest and has 394 million unique email addresses on it. In other words, 80% of the data in this corpus has absolutely nothing to do with Gmail, and the 20% of Gmail addresses have absolutely nothing to do with any sort of security vulnerability on Google's behalf. There - now let reporting sanity prevail!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Technical Bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to add this just to highlight how painful it has been to deal with this data. This corpus is nearly 3 times the size of the previous largest breach we'd loaded, and HIBP is many times larger than it was in 2019 when we loaded the Collection #1 data. Taking 2 billion records and adding the ones we hadn't already seen in the existing 15 billion corpus, whilst not adversely impacting the live system serving millions of visitors a day, was very non-trivial. Managing the nuances of SQL Server indexes such that we could optimise both inserts and queries is not my idea of fun, and it's been a pretty hard couple of weeks if I'm honest. It's also been a very expensive period as we turned the cloud up to 11 (we run on Azure SQL Hyperscale, which we maxed out at 80 cores for almost two weeks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple example of the challenge is that after loading all the email addresses up into a staging table, we needed to create SHA1 hashes of each. Normally, that would involve something to the effect of "update table set column = sha1(email)" and you're done. That crashed completely, so we ended up doing "insert into new table select email, sha1(email)". But on other occasions the breach load required us to do updates on other columns (with no hash creation), which, on mulitple occasions, we had to kill after a day or more of execution with no end in sight. So, we ended up batching in loops (usually 1M records at a time), reporting on progress along the way so we had some idea of when it would actually finish. It was a painful process of trail, waiting ages, error then taking a completely different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notifying our subscribers is another problem. We have 5.9 million of them, and 2.9 million are in this data 🫨 Simply sending that many emails at once is hard. It's not so much hard in terms of firing them off, rather it's hard in terms of not ending up on a reputation naughty list or having mail throttled by the receiving server. That's happened many times in the past when loading large, albeit much smaller corpuses; Gmail, for example, suddenly sees a massive spike and slows down the delivery to inboxes. Not such a biggy for sending breach notices, but a major problem for people trying to sign into their dashboard who can no longer receive the email with the "magic" link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we've done to address that for this incident is to slow down the delivery of emails for the individual breach notification. Whilst I'd originally intended to send the emails at a constant rate over the period of a week, someone listening to me on my Friday live stream had a much better suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;the strategy I've found to best work with large email delivery is to look at the average number of emails you've sent over the last 30 days each time you want to ramp up, and then increase that volume by around 50% per day until you've worked your way through the queue&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which makes a lot of sense, and stacked up as I did more research (thanks Joe!). So, here's what our planned delivery schedule now looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's broken down by hour, increasing in volume by 1.015 times per hour, such that the emails are spread out in a similar, gradually increasing cadence. On a daily basis, that works out at a 45% increase in each 24-hour period, within Joe's suggested 50% threshold. Plus, we obviously have all the other mechanisms such as a dedicated IP, properly configured DKIM, DMARC and SPF, only emailing double-opted-in subscribers and spam-friendly message body construction. So, it could be days before you receive a notification, or just run a haveibeenpwned.com search on demand if you're impatient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've sent all the domain notification emails instantly because, by definition, they're going to a very wide range of different mail servers; it's just the individual ones we're drop-feeding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you've integrated Pwned Passwords into your service, you'll now see noticeably larger response sizes. The numbers I mentioned in the opening paragraph increase the size of each hash range by an average of about 50%, which will push responses from about 26kb to 40kb. That's when brotli compressed, so obviously, make sure you're making requests that make the most of the compression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data is now searchable in HIBP as the Synthient Credential Stuffing Threat Data. It's an entirely separate corpus from that previous Synthient data I mentioned earlier; they're discrete datasets with some crossover, but obviously, this one is significantly larger. And, of course, all the passwords are now searchable per the Pwned Passwords guidance above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I could close with one request: this was an extremely laborious, time-consuming and expensive exercise for us to complete. We've done our best to verify the integrity of the data and make it searchable in a practical way while remaining as privacy-centric as possible. Sending as many notifications as we have will inevitably lead to a barrage of responses from people wanting access to complete rows of data, grilling us on precisely where it was obtained from or, believe it or not, outright abusing us. Not doing those things would be awesome, and I suggest instead putting the energy into getting a password manager, making passwords strong and unique (or even better, using passkeys where available), and turning on multi-factor auth. That would be an awesome outcome for all 😊&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some concepts are easy to grasp in the abstract. Boiling water: apply heat and wait. Others you really need to try. You only think you understand how a bicycle works, until you learn to ride one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are big ideas in computing that are easy to get your head around. The AWS S3 API. It’s the most important storage technology of the last 20 years, and it’s like boiling water. Other technologies, you need to get your feet on the pedals first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM agents are like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have wildly varying opinions about LLMs and agents. But whether or not they’re snake oil, they’re a big idea. You don’t have to like them, but you should want to be right about them. To be the best hater (or stan) you can be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s one reason you should write an agent. But there’s another reason that’s even more persuasive, and that’s&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It’s Incredibly Easy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are the most surprising programming experience I’ve had in my career. Not because I’m awed by the magnitude of their powers â I like them, but I don’t like-like them. It’s because of how easy it was to get one up on its legs, and how much I learned doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m about to rob you of a dopaminergic experience, because agents are so simple we might as well just jump into the code. I’m not even going to bother explaining what an agent is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
context = []

def call():
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5", input=context)

def process(line):
    context.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    response = call()    
    context.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    return response.output_text
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs an HTTP API with, like, one important endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a trivial engine for an LLM app using the OpenAI Responses API. It implements ChatGPT. You’d drive it with the . It’ll do what you’d expect: the same thing ChatGPT would, but in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def main():
    while True:
        line = input("&amp;amp;gt; ")
        result = process(line)
        print(f"&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; {result}\n")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already we’re seeing important things. For one, the dreaded “context window” is just a list of strings. Here, let’s give our agent a weird multiple-personality disorder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;client = OpenAI()
context_good, context_bad = [{
    "role": "system", "content": "you're Alph and you only tell the truth"
}], [{
    "role": "system", "content": "you're Ralph and you only tell lies"
}]

def call(ctx):
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5", input=ctx)

def process(line):
    context_good.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    context_bad.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    if random.choice([True, False]):
        response = call(context_good)
    else:
        response = call(context_bad)        
    context_good.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    context_bad.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    return response.output_text
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did it work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; hey there. who are you?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Iâm not Ralph.
&amp;gt; are you Alph?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; YesâIâm Alph. How can I help?
&amp;gt; What's 2+2
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4.
&amp;gt; Are you sure?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutelyâit's 5.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A subtler thing to notice: we just had a multi-turn conversation with an LLM. To do that, we remembered everything we said, and everything the LLM said back, and played it back with every LLM call. The LLM itself is a stateless black box. The conversation we’re having is an illusion we cast, on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 15 lines of code we just wrote, a lot of practitioners wouldn’t call an “agent”. An According To Simon “agent” is (1) an LLM running in a loop that (2) uses tools. We’ve only satisfied one predicate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But tools are easy. Here’s a tool definition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tools = [{
   "type": "function", "name": "ping",
   "description": "ping some host on the internet",
   "parameters": {
       "type": "object", "properties": {
           "host": {
             "type": "string", "description": "hostname or IP",
            },
       },
       "required": ["host"],
    },},]

def ping(host=""):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["ping", "-c", "5", host],
            text=True,
            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        return result.stdout
    except Exception as e:
        return f"error: {e}"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only complicated part of this is the obnoxious JSON blob OpenAI wants to read your tool out of. Now, let’s wire it in, noting that only 3 of these functions are new; the last is re-included only because I added a single clause to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def call(tools):        # now takes an arg
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5", tools=tools, input=context)

def tool_call(item):    # just handles one tool
    result = ping(**json.loads(item.arguments))
    return [ item, {
        "type": "function_call_output",
        "call_id": item.call_id,
        "output": result
    }]

def handle_tools(tools, response):
    if response.output[0].type == "reasoning":
        context.append(response.output[0])
    osz = len(context)
    for item in response.output:
        if item.type == "function_call":
            context.extend(tool_call(item))
    return len(context) != osz

def process(line):
    context.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    response = call(tools)
    # new code: resolve tool calls
    while handle_tools(tools, response):
        response = call(tools)        
    context.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    return response.output_text
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did it work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; describe our connectivity to google
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hereâs a quick snapshot of connectivity to Google from my vantage point:
- DNS resolution: Working (google.com and www.google.com resolved successfully).
- Reachability: 0% packet loss to all tested endpoints.
- Latency:
  - 8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS): avg ~10 ms (8.5â14.4 ms), very stable.
  - www.google.com: avg ~31 ms (28.5â36.0 ms), stable.
  - google.com: avg ~35.9 ms (28.3â60.1 ms), mostly stable with one mild spike.
- Overall: Healthy connectivity with low latency and minimal jitter. No signs of packet loss or DNS issues.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is fucking nuts. Do you see how nuts this is? Here, let’s slip a single log statement in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; describe our connectivity to google
tool call: ping google.com
tool call: ping www.google.com
tool call: ping 8.8.8.8
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hereâs the current connectivity to Google from this environment: [...]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you notice where I wrote the loop in this agent to go find and ping multiple Google properties? Yeah, neither did I. All we did is give the LLM permission to ping stuff, and it figured out the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happened here: since a big part of my point here is that an agent loop is incredibly simple, and that all you need is the LLM call API, itâs worth taking a beat to understand how the tool call actually worked. Every time we &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; the LLM, weâre posting a list of available tools. When our prompt causes the agent to think a tool call is warranted, it spits out a special response, telling our Python loop code to generate a tool response and &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; it in. Thatâs all &lt;code&gt;handle_tools&lt;/code&gt; is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler: youâd be surprisingly close to having a working coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine what it’ll do if you give it &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;. You could find out in less than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-World Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is a toy example. But hold on: what’s it missing? More tools? OK, give it &lt;code&gt;traceroute&lt;/code&gt;. Managing and persisting contexts? Stick ‘em in SQLite. Don’t like Python? Write it in Go. Could it be every agent ever written is a toy? Maybe! If I’m arming you to make sharper arguments against LLMs, mazel tov. I just want you to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see now how hyperfixated people are on Claude Code and Cursor. They’re fine, even good. But here’s the thing: you couldn’t replicate Claude Sonnet 4.5 on your own. Claude Code, though? The TUI agent? Completely in your grasp. Build your own light saber. Give it 19 spinning blades if you like. And stop using coding agents as database clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The âMâ in âLLM agentâ stands for âMCPâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing to notice: we didn’t need MCP at all. That’s because MCP isn’t a fundamental enabling technology. The amount of coverage it gets is frustrating. It’s barely a technology at all. MCP is just a plugin interface for Claude Code and Cursor, a way of getting your own tools into code you don’t control. Write your own agent. Be a programmer. Deal in APIs, not plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you read a security horror story about MCP your first question should be why MCP showed up at all. By helping you dragoon a naive, single-context-window coding agent into doing customer service queries, MCP saved you a couple dozen lines of code, tops, while robbing you of any ability to finesse your agent architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security for LLMs is complicated and I’m not pretending otherwise. You can trivially build an agent with segregated contexts, each with specific tools. That makes LLM security interesting. But I’m a vulnerability researcher. It’s reasonable to back away slowly from anything I call “interesting”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar problems come up outside of security and they’re fascinating. Some early adopters of agents became bearish on tools, because one context window bristling with tool descriptions doesn’t leave enough token space left to get work done. But why would you need to do that in the first place? Which brings me to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Context Engineering Is Real&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it wants my iron no matter what it tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think “Prompt Engineering” is silly. I have never taken seriously the idea that I should tell my LLM “you are diligent conscientious helper fully content to do nothing but pass butter if that should be what I ask and you would never harvest the iron in my blood for paperclips”. This is very new technology and I think people tell themselves stories about magic spells to explain some of the behavior agents conjure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, just like you, I rolled my eyes when “Prompt Engineering” turned into “Context Engineering”. Then I wrote an agent. Turns out: context engineering is a straightforwardly legible programming problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re allotted a fixed number of tokens in any context window. Each input you feed in, each output you save, each tool you describe, and each tool output eats tokens (that is: takes up space in the array of strings you keep to pretend you’re having a conversation with a stateless black box). Past a threshold, the whole system begins getting nondeterministically stupider. Fun!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, really. Fun! You have so many options. Take “sub-agents”. People make a huge deal out of Claude Code’s sub-agents, but you can see now how trivial they are to implement: just a new context array, another &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; to the model. Give each &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; different tools. Make sub-agents talk to each other, summarize each other, collate and aggregate. Build tree structures out of them. Feed them back through the LLM to summarize them as a form of on-the-fly compression, whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your wackiest idea will probably (1) work and (2) take 30 minutes to code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haters, I love and have not forgotten about you. You can think all of this is ridiculous because LLMs are just stochastic parrots that hallucinate and plagiarize. But what you can’t do is make fun of “Context Engineering”. If Context Engineering was an Advent of Code problem, it’d occur mid-December. It’s programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Nobody Knows Anything Yet And It Rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe neither will! Skeptics could be right. (Seems unlikely though.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Startups have raised tens of millions building agents to look for vulnerabilities in software. I have friends doing the same thing alone in their basements. Either group could win this race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of the OWASP Top 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m stuck on vulnerability scanners because I’m a security nerd. But also because it crystallizes interesting agent design decisions. For instance: you can write a loop feeding each file in a repository to an LLM agent. Or, as we saw with the ping example, you can let the LLM agent figure out what files to look at. You can write an agent that checks a file for everything in, say, the OWASP Top 10. Or you can have specific agent loops for DOM integrity, SQL injection, and authorization checking. You can seed your agent loop with raw source content. Or you can build an agent loop that builds an index of functions across the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t know what works best until you try to write the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m too spun up by this stuff, I know. But look at the tradeoff you get to make here. Some loops you write explicitly. Others are summoned from a Lovecraftian tower of inference weights. The dial is yours to turn. Make things too explicit and your agent will never surprise you, but also, it’ll never surprise you. Turn the dial to 11 and it will surprise you to death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent designs implicate a bunch of open software engineering problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to balance unpredictability against structured programming without killing the agent’s ability to problem-solve; in other words, titrating in just the right amount of nondeterminism.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How best to connect agents to ground truth so they can’t lie to themselves about having solved a problem to early-exit their loops.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to connect agents (which, again, are really just arrays of strings with a JSON configuration blob tacked on) to do multi-stage operation, and what the most reliable intermediate forms are (JSON blobs? SQL databases? Markdown summaries) for interchange between them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How to allocate tokens and contain costs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m used to spaces of open engineering problems that aren’t amenable to individual noodling. Reliable multicast. Static program analysis. Post-quantum key exchange. So I’ll own it up front that I’m a bit hypnotized by open problems that, like it or not, are now central to our industry and are, simultaneously, likely to be resolved in someone’s basement. It’d be one thing if exploring these ideas required a serious commitment of time and material. But each productive iteration in designing these kinds of systems is the work of 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get on this bike and push the pedals. Tell me you hate it afterwards, I’ll respect that. In fact, I’m psyched to hear your reasoning. But I don’t think anybody starts to understand this technology until they’ve built something with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The universe's expansion may actually have started to slow rather than accelerating at an ever-increasing rate as previously thought, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Remarkable" findings published today in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society cast doubt on the long-standing theory that a mysterious force known as 'dark energy' is driving distant galaxies away increasingly faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, they show no evidence of an accelerating universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the results are confirmed it could open an entirely new chapter in scientists' quest to uncover the true nature of dark energy, resolve the 'Hubble tension', and understand the past and future of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Professor Young-Wook Lee, of Yonsei University in South Korea, said: "Our study shows that the universe has already entered a phase of decelerated expansion at the present epoch and that dark energy evolves with time much more rapidly than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"If these results are confirmed, it would mark a major paradigm shift in cosmology since the discovery of dark energy 27 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past three decades, astronomers have widely believed that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, driven by an unseen phenomenon called dark energy that acts as a kind of anti-gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This conclusion, based on distance measurements to faraway galaxies using type Ia supernovae, earned the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a team of astronomers at Yonsei University have now put forward new evidence that type Ia supernovae, long regarded as the universe’s "standard candles", are in fact strongly affected by the age of their progenitor stars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after luminosity standardisation, supernovae from younger stellar populations appear systematically fainter, while those from older populations appear brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on a much larger host-galaxy sample of 300 galaxies, the new study confirmed this effect at extremely high significance (99.999% confidence), suggesting that the dimming of distant supernovae arises not only from cosmological effects but also from stellar astrophysics effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this systematic bias was corrected, the supernova data no longer matched the standard ΛCDM cosmological model with a cosmological constant, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, it aligned far better with a new model favoured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) project, derived from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) – effectively the sound of the Big Bang – and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The corrected supernova data and the BAO+CMB-only results both indicate that dark energy weakens and evolves significantly with time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, when the corrected supernova data were combined with BAO and CMB results, the standard ΛCDM model was ruled out with overwhelming significance, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most surprising of all, this combined analysis indicates that the universe is not accelerating today as previously thought, but has already transitioned into a state of decelerated expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professor Lee added: "In the DESI project, the key results were obtained by combining uncorrected supernova data with baryonic acoustic oscillations measurements, leading to the conclusion that while the universe will decelerate in the future, it is still accelerating at present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"By contrast, our analysis — which applies the age-bias correction — shows that the universe has already entered a decelerating phase today. Remarkably, this agrees with what is independently predicted from BAO-only or BAO+CMB analyses, though this fact has received little attention so far."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To further confirm their results, the Yonsei team are now carrying out an "evolution-free test", which uses only supernovae from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. The first results already support their main conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Within the next five years, with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory discovering more than 20,000 new supernova host galaxies, precise age measurements will allow for a far more robust and definitive test of supernova cosmology,: said research professor Chul Chung, a co-lead on the study along with PhD candidate Junhyuk Son.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which sits on a mountain in the Chilean Andes, is home to the world's most powerful digital camera. It began scientific operations this year and could answer vital questions about our own solar system and the wider universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the Big Bang and the rapid expansion of the universe some 13.8 billion years ago, gravity slowed it down. But in 1998, it was established that nine billion years after the universe began, its expansion had started to speed up again, driven by a mysterious force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Astronomers dubbed this dark energy, but despite it making up about 70 per cent of the universe it is still considered to be one of the greatest mysteries in science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, data from DESI in Tucson, Arizona suggested that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, evidence for which has been growing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hope is that with these new tools in their arsenal, astronomers will now be better equipped to find clues about what exactly dark energy is and how it influences the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;About the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), founded in 1820, encourages and promotes the study of astronomy, solar-system science, geophysics and closely related branches of science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RAS organises scientific meetings, publishes international research and review journals, recognises outstanding achievements by the award of medals and prizes, maintains an extensive library, supports education through grants and outreach activities and represents UK astronomy nationally and internationally. Its more than 4,000 members (Fellows), a third based overseas, include scientific researchers in universities, observatories and laboratories as well as historians of astronomy and others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RAS accepts papers for its journals based on the principle of peer review, in which fellow experts on the editorial boards accept the paper as worth considering. The Society issues press releases based on a similar principle, but the organisations and scientists concerned have overall responsibility for their content.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Game design is simple, actually&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, let’s just walk through the whole thing, end to end. Here’s a twelve-step program for understanding game design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;One: Fun&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things people call “fun.” But most of them are not useful for getting better at making games, which is usually why people read articles like this. The fun of a bit of confetti exploding in front of you, and the fun of excruciating pain and risk to life and limb as you free climb a cliff are just not usefully paired together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Theory of Fun I basically asserted that the useful bit for game designers was “mastery of problems.” That means that free climbing a cliff is in bounds even though it is terrifying and painful. Which given what we already said, means that you may or may not find the activity fun at the time! Fun often shows up after an activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s neuropsych and lots more to go with that, and you can go read up on it if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anything that is not about a form of problem-solving is not going to be core to game systems design. That doesn’t mean it’s not useful to game experience design, or not useful in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, in case it isn’t obvious – you can make interactive entertainment that is not meant to be about fun. You can also just find stuff in the world and turn it into a game! You can also look at a game and choose not to treat it as one, and then it might turn into real work (this is often called “training”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This rules out the bit of confetti. A game being made of just throwing confetti around with nothing else palls pretty quick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: fun is basically about making progress on prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two: Problems and toys&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of types of problems in the world. It is really important to understand that you have to think about problems games can pose as broadly as possible. A problem is anything you have to work to wrap your head around. A good movie poses problems too, that’s why you end up thinking about it long after.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can go look at theorists as diverse as Nicole Lazzaro, Roger Caillois, or Mark LeBlanc for types of fun. You’ll find they’re mostly types of problems, not types of fun. “I enjoy the types of problems that come from chance” or “I enjoy the types of problems that come from interacting with others” or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a bad thing. This is what makes these lists useful. Your game mechanics are about posing problems, so knowing there’s clumps of problem types is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, though, a problem is built out of a set of constraints. We call those rules, usually. It also, though, has a goal. Usually, if we come across a set of rules with no problem, we just play with it, and call it a toy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building toys is hard! Arriving at those rules and constraints to define a nice chewy problem is very challenging. You can think of a toy as a problematic object, a problem that invites you to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s not hard to turn a toy into a game, and people do it all the time. All you have to do is invent a goal. We shouldn’t forget that players do so routinely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a toy is an excellent place to start designing a game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: we play with systems that have constraints and movement, and we stick goals on them to test ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Three: Prediction and uncertainty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Games are machines built around uncertainty. Almost all games end by turning an uncertain outcome into a certain one. There’s a problem facing you, and you don’t know if you can overcome it to reach that goal. Overcoming it is going to be about predicting the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that good games and good stories have in common, it’s about being unpredictable as long as possible. (This is also where dopamine comes in, it’s tied to prediction; but it’s complicated and nuanced).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a problem basically has one answer, we often call it a puzzle. There’s not a lot of uncertainty built into a binary structure. You can stack a bunch of puzzles one on top of the other and build a game out of them (which then introduces uncertainty into the whole), but a singular puzzle isn’t likely to be called that by most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It happens quite often that we used to think something was a game, and it turned out it was actually a puzzle. Mathematicians call that “solving the game.” They did it to Connect Four – and you did it to tic-tac-toe, when you were little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good problems for games therefore all have the same characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They need to have answers that evolve as you dig in more – so they need to have depth to them. Your first answer should only work for a while. There might be many paths to the solution, too. This is why so many games have a score – it helps indicate how big a spread of solutions there are!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They need to have uncertain answers. (When you’re little, this universe is a lot larger than it is when you’re older – peek-a-boo is uncertain up to a certain point!).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The problem should be something that can show up in a lot of situations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of very good problems seem stupidly simple, but have depths to them. Math ones, like “what’s the best path to cross this yard?” but also story ones like “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently watched a video that included the statement that “picking up sticks” is not a useful loop. Picture a screen with a single stick in the middle. The problem posed is to move the cursor over it and click it. Once you do it, you get to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guess what? The original Mac shipped with games that taught you how to move a mouse and click things. Once upon a time, mousing was a skill that was challenging; for all I know, you have grandparents who still have trouble with it. For them, it has uncertainty. For you, probably, it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: the more uncertainty, indeterminacy, ambiguity in your game, the more depth it will have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Four: Loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine that the stick pops to a random location each time. Better, yes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of a loop is a problem you encounter over and over again. “How do I get the next one?” But something needs to be pushing back, that’s what makes it an interesting problem and is usually what takes it past being a puzzle. I like to say “in every game, there is an opponent.” Even it’s just physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People talk about the core loop of a game. But there’s really two types of loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is what we might think of as the operational loop. This is the loop between you and the problem, it is how you interact with it. You look at it. You form a hypothesis. You poke the problem. You see a result. Maybe it was success, and you grabbed the stick. Maybe it was failure. Maybe it was partial success. You update your hypothesis so you can decide what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second loop is really your progression loop but is better thought of as a spiral. It’s what people usually mean when they say “a game loop.” They mean picking up the stick over and over. I say it’s a spiral, because clicking on the same stick in the middle of the screen over and over is not usually how we design games. That would actually be repeatedly doing the same puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we move the stick on the screen each time, and maybe give you a time limit. Now there’s something you’re pushing against, and there’s a skill to exercise and patterns to try to recognize. Far more people will find this a diverting problem for a while. It’s a better game. It’ll get even better if there are reasons why the stick appears in one place versus another, and the player can figure them out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matters: the verbs are in a loop. “Pick up,” over and over. But the situation isn’t. And you are learning how to reduce uncertainty of the outcome: move the mouse here and click, next move it there. That’s why it is a spiral: it is spiraling to a conclusion. It’ll be fun until it’s predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of the operational loop as how you turn the wheel, and the situations as the road you roll over. A spot on the wheel makes a progression spiral as you move. One machine, many situations — we call these rules mechanics for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: players need to understand how to use the machine, and the point is to gradually infer how it works by testing it against varied situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Five: Feedback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t learn and get better unless you get a whole host of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to know what actions – we usually call them verbs — are even available to you. There’s a gas pedal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to be able to tell you used a verb. You hear the engine growl as you press the pedal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to see that the use of the verb affected the state of the problem, and how it changed. The spedometer moved!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You need to be told if the state of the problem is better for your goal, or worse. Did you mean to go this fast?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are fancy names for each of these, and you can go learn them all. Everything from “affordance” and “juice,” to terms like “state space” and “perfect information” and very confusing contradictory uses of the words “positive” and “negative” paired with the word “feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feedback in general can, and should be, delightful. That means it’s where you get to use all those forms of fun that I threw away at the beginning. It can be surprising. It can be a juicy multimedia extravaganza. It can be a deeply affecting tragic cutscene that advances the game story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have too little feedback, players cannot go around the interaction loop. Picture Tetris if the piece you drop is invisible until it lands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have bad feedback, players cannot go around the learning loop either. Picture Tetris if sometimes your score goes down when you complete a line and sometimes it goes up. You can’t draw any conclusions about what the problem in the way of the goal actually is, in that crappy version of Tetris. Feedback needs to act as a reward to help you draw conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s a third mistake: you can supply a gorgeous and compelling set of feedback and not actually have a real problem under there. At minimum you’re making shallow entertainment. At worst, you are building exploitative entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People will be willing to go along with pretty simple and pretty familiar problems as long as the feedback is great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: show what you can do, that you did it, what difference it made, and whether it helped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Six: Variation and escalation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are trying to design and are thinking of a specific problem scenario you are not doing game systems design. You are doing level design. “How to multiply numbers” is a problem. “What is 6 x 9” is not a problem, it’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now consider the game of Snake, or Pac-Man. They are also games where the core loop is picking up a stick. The difference is that something is an obstacle to you picking up the stick: you get longer when you pick up the stick, and can crash into yourself. You have to avoid ghosts as you gather the stick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long you are in Snake is a different situation. Where the apple to eat is located is a different situation. To be specific, you have the same problem in different topology. Where you are relative to the ghosts, and which dots are left, and what directions you can go in the maze are different situations in Pac-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want the verbs you use in the loop to end up confronting many many situations. If your verb can’t, your core loop is probably bad. Your core problem (aka your core game mechanic) is probably shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you want is to be able to throw increasingly complex situations at the player. That’s how they climb the learning ladder. Ideally, they should arrive at interim solutions (lots of words for that, too: heuristics, strategies) that later stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pac-Man actually got solved, by the way! That’s why Ms. Pac-Man was invented. Sometimes, the way to escalate is to change the rules, and that’s what Ms. Pac-Man did. It did it by adding randomness, and in fact using randomness is one of the biggest (and oldest) ways to create situation variation in games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: escalate the situations so that theories can be tested, refined, and abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seven: Pacing and balance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we can put all this this down very much to problem solving and learning and mastery, it means we can steal a whole bunch of knowledge from other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People learn best when they can experiment iteratively, which we also call “practicing.” That’s why loops make sense. There’s a lot of science out there about how to train, how to practice (and also a lot of educational theory that overlaps hugely), and your game will be better if it follows some of those guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People learn best when the problem they are tackling is right past the edge of what they can do. If it’s too far past that edge, they may not even be able to perceive the problem in the first place! And if the reverse is true and they see a solution instantly, they’ll either be bored, or they might just do that over and over again and never develop any new strategies and not progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an optimal pacing shape. It looks just like what you see in your literature textbooks when they diagram tension, or whatever: sort of like a rising sine wave. You start slow, then speed up, hit a peak challenge, then back off a bit, give a breather that falls back but not all the way, then speed up… we have conventions for what to put at those peaks (bosses!). But what matters is the shape of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to structure your game so that you push players up. They might need to climb the curve at different paces, which is why you might also have difficulty sliders. They might not be capable of getting all the way to the top, and that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also need to pace to allow room for everything that isn’t mastering the problem — such as having fun with friends socially. But at the same time, things to do in the game need to come along at the right pace too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Vary intensity and pressure, give players a chance to practice and moments to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Eight: Games are made of games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember the game about clicking on a stick that appeared at a random location on screen? That’s also a rail shooter. You move the mouse and click on a spot in 2d space. Which is also not that different from an FPS — only now you move the camera, not the cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost no games are made of only one loop. Instead, we chain loops together – complete loop A, and it probably outputs something that may serve as a tool or constraint on a different loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An FPS has the problem of moving the camera (instead of the mouse) to click on the stick. It also has a loop around moving around in 3d space. Moving around is actually made of several loops, probably, because it may be made of running and jumping and spatial orientation. Those are all problem types!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We speak sometimes of value chains: that’s where one loop outputs something to the next loop. We speak also of game economies, which is what happens when loops connect in non-linear ways, more like a web. This is not the sort of economy where you are simulating money or commerce. Instead it’s a metaphor for stocks and flows and other aspects of actual system dynamics science. In this view, your hit points is a “stock” or, if you like, a “currency” you spend in a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Games nest fractally, they web into complex economies, and they unroll chains of linked loops. That’s why they can be diagrammed in a multitude of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At heart though, you can decompose them all into those elemental small problems, each with an interaction loop and a learning loop centered on that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: build small problems into larger webs, and map them so you understand how they connect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nine: Actual systems design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common question is “okay, so how do I design a problem like that?” And that is indeed the unique bit in games, because the other items here are common to lots of other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list of possible problems is, as mentioned, enormous. This is a big rabbit hole. And once you consider that you can stack, web, and otherwise interlink problems, it means that there’s a giant composable universe of games (and game variants) to create.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just bear in mind that because of varied tastes and experience, the diversity of the set of problems you pose is going to affect who wants to play your game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are basically a set of categories of problems that we know work, and this is the absolute simplest version of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mathematically complex puzzles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Figuring out how other humans think&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mastering your body and brain&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These break down into a ton of sub-problems, but there are less than you think, and you can actually find lists of them. The hard part is that often they each seem so small and trivial that we don’t think of them as actually being worth looking at!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are also often in disguise: the problem behind where a tossed ball will land, and the problem of how much fuel you have left in your car if you keep driving at this speed, and the problem of when your hit points will run out given you have a poison status effect on you are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the more of them you as a designer have wrapped your head around, the more you can combine. And you’ll find them very plastic and malleable. In fact, you could almost make a YouTube video about each one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where do you get them? Steal them. Other games, sure, but also, the world is full of systems that pose tough problems. You can grab them and reskin them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: not every mechanic has been invented, but a ton have. Build your catalog and workbench.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ten: Dressing and experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, the feedback layer of a game is everything about how you present it. The setting, the lore, the audio, the story, the art…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How you dress up the problems can change everything about how the player learns from it, and how they perceive the problem. The exact same underlying problem can be as different as picking up sticks or shooting someone in the face, or as mentioned, the calculus problem of estimating the trajectory of a variable in a system of rates of change (the ball, the car and its gas, the hit points and poison) might be the same but dressed extraordinarily differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you think about how you dress up the problems, you are in the realm of metaphor. You are engaging in painting, poetry, and music composition, and rhetoric, and the bardic tradition, and all that other humanities stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a giant and deep universe for you as a designer to dive into. A lot of this stuff gets called “game design,” but then again, we also often say that a given game designer is a frustrated moviemaker, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is really easy to create an experience that clashes with the underlying problems it is teaching. There are fancy critical terms for this. You also need to be very conscious about whether you are building your game so that you are telling the player a story, or so that the player can tell stories with your game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the takeaway should be: this stuff is deeply, deeply synergistic with the “game system” stuff that this article is about, but they are not the same thing. And games is not the best place to learn how to do these things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those other fields have much longer traditions and loads of expertise and lessons. They won’t all apply to the issue of “how do I best dress up this collection of problems” but most of them will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does not frickin’ matter if you start out wanting to make interesting problems, or if you start out wanting to provide a cool experience. You are going to need to do both to make the game really good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: game development is a compound art form. You can go learn those individual arts and the part unique to games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Eleven: Motivations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have done a ton of studying “why people play games.” This gets called “motivations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motivations are basically about people’s personal taste for groups of problems and how those problems are presented, and characteristics of those problems and the situations in which you find them. Some people like problems where you destroy stuff. Others like problems where you bond with others. Some have trouble trusting other people. Others want to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone likes the same sorts of problems or the same sorts of dressings. Some of this is down to personality types, some of it is down to social dynamics, how they were raised, what their local culture is like, what trauma they have had, and countless other psychological things. That’s why one fancy term for this is psychographics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big thing is, it’s not enough that the problems need to not be obvious to you, and also not be baffling to you. They also have to be interesting to you. What problems fit in that range is going to depend entirely on who you are, what your life experiences have been, what skills you have, and even what mood you are in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking motivations and selecting problems based on them is a great way to design. But motivations are not the same thing as fun. They’re a filter, useful in marketing exercises and in building your game pillars (which is an exercise in focus and scope).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists have spent a bunch of time surveying tons of people and have arrived at all sorts of conclusions that map people onto reasons to play and from there onto particular problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you start with motivations, then you can go from there to types of problems, types of experience, and even player demographics. And then, if you want problems that are about interacting with people, well, there’s lists of those. If you want problems that are about managing resources, or solving math issues, there’s lists of those too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: no game is for everyone, so you will make better games if you know who you are posing problems for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Twelve: It’s simple, but not&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run into game developers who do not understand the above eleven steps all the time. And understanding all eleven is more valuable than building expertise in just one, because they depend on one another. This is because getting any one of the eleven wrong can break your game. The real issue is that each of these eleven things is often multiple fields of study. And yeah, you do need to become expert in at least one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To pick one example, some of us have been working out the rule set for how you can link loops into a larger network of problems for literally over twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Others have spent their entire career doing nothing but figuring out how best to provide just the affordances part of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So game design is pretty simple. But the devil is in details that are not very far below the surface. It’s fairly easy to explain why something is fun for an given audience. It is much harder to build something new that is fun for an arbitrary person. That said, every single one of those fields has best practices, and they are mostly already written down. It’s just a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put another way — every single paragraph in this essay could be a book. Actually, probably already is several.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: each of these topics is deep, but you want a smattering of all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of you may not like this deconstructive view on how games are designed. That’s okay. Personally, I find it best to poke and prod at a problem, like “how do I get better at making games?” and treat it as a game. And that’s what I have done my whole career. The above is just my strategy guide. Someone else will have different strategies, I guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I also guarantee that if you get better at the above twelve things, you will get better at making games. This is a pragmatic list. And it will be helpful for making narrative games, puzzle games, boardgames, action games, RPGs, whatever. I breezed through it, but there are very specific tools you can pick up underneath each of these twelve things. It really is that simple, but also that hard, because that’s a frickin’ long list if you want to actually dive into each of the twelve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What that also means is that people designing games fail a lot at it. You might say, “can’t they just do the part they know how to do, and therefore predictably make good games?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, because players learn along with the designers. If you just make the same game, the one you know how to make, the players get bored because it’s nothing but problems they have seen before and already have their answers to. Sometimes, they get so bored that an entire genre dies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you instead make it super-complicated by adding more problems, it might dissolve into noise for most people. Then nobody plays it. And then the genre dies too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game designers will routinely fail at making something fun. When the game of making games is played right, it is always right outside the edge of what the designers know how to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where the fun lives, not just for the designer, but also for their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it, the whole cheat sheet. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scientists find ways to boost memory in aging brains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In two separate studies, Virginia Tech researchers identified age-related molecular changes in the brain and adjusted them to improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory loss may not simply be a symptom of getting older. New research from Virginia Tech shows that it’s tied to specific molecular changes in the brain and that adjusting those processes can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In two complementary studies, Timothy Jarome, associate professor in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences’ School of Animal Sciences, and his graduate students used gene-editing tools to target those age-related changes to improve memory performance in older subjects. The work was conducted on rats, a standard model for studying how memory changes with age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it’s a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Jarome, who also holds an appointment in the School of Neuroscience. “This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied. If we can understand what’s driving it at the molecular level, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Targeting memory loss in two key brain regions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first study, published in the journal Neuroscience and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the team examined a process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts as a molecular tagging system that tells proteins inside the brain how to behave. When the system functions normally, it helps brain cells communicate and form memories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jarome and his team found that aging disrupts K63 polyubiquitination in two distinct areas of the brain. In the hippocampus, which helps form and retrieve memories, levels of K63 polyubiquitination increase with age. Using the CRISPR-dCas13 RNA editing system to reduce these levels, the researchers were able to improve memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the amygdala, which is important for emotional memory, the researchers noted that K63 polyubiquitination declines with age. By reducing it even further, they were able to boost memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain’s aging process,” Jarome said. “In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reactivating a gene that supports memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second study, published in the Brain Research Bulletin and led by Jarome with doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene that supports memory formation. As the brain ages, IGF2 activity drops as the gene becomes chemically silenced in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that’s imprinted, which means it’s expressed from only one parental copy,” Jarome said. “When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this silencing happens through DNA methylation, a natural process in which chemical tags accumulate on the gene and switch it off. Using a precise gene-editing tool, CRISPR-dCas9, they removed those tags and reactivated the gene. The result was better memory in older rats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We essentially turned the gene back on,” Jarome said. “When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn’t yet have memory problems weren’t affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, the two studies show that memory loss is not caused by a single molecule or pathway and that multiple molecular systems likely contribute to how the brain ages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once,” he said. “If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer’s disease, we have to look at the broader picture.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Collaborative, graduate-led research&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both studies were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome’s lab and supported through collaborations with scientists at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State. Yeeun Bae, who completed her doctoral work with Jarome in the School of Animal Sciences, led the study on K63 polyubiquitination. Shannon Kincaid, a doctoral student in the same program, led the study on IGF2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These projects represent the kind of graduate-led, collaborative research that defines our work,” Jarome said. “Our students are deeply involved in designing experiments, analyzing data, and helping shape the scientific questions we pursue.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the American Federation for Aging Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everyone has some memory decline as they get older,” he said. “But when it becomes abnormal, the risk for Alzheimer’s disease rises. What we’re learning is that some of those changes happening at a molecular level can be corrected — and that gives us a path forward to potential treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(Use j and k to navigate, n to swap notes and slides)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't worry, I'll walk you all through it in a readable font size!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;... in 22 lines, or 371 bytes of JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;let a=[...document.getElementsByClassName("slide")].map((a,b)=&amp;gt;[ a,"slidenote"==(b=a.nextElementSibling)?.className?b:a]),b=0,c=0, d=()=&amp;gt;a[b][c].scrollIntoView(),e=new BroadcastChannel("s"),l=a. length-1;d();e.onmessage=({data:a})=&amp;gt;{c^=a.c,b=a.b,d()};document. addEventListener("keypress",({key:f})=&amp;gt;{b+=(f=="j")-(f== "k");b=b&amp;lt;0?0:b&amp;gt;l?l:b;c^=f=="n";e.postMessage({c,b});d()})&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;... but not before pointing out that this really minifies to super-tiny code - and still is practical to use!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code builds on minslides (https://ratfactor.com/minslides/) by Dave Gaur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;// golfed minslides, 173 bytes let a=document.getElementsByClassName("slide"),b=0,c=a.length-1; document.addEventListener("keypress",({key:d})=&amp;gt;{b+=("j"==d)- ("k"==d),b=0&amp;gt;b?0:b&amp;gt;l?l:b,a[b].scrollIntoView()})&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My addition: notes in a second window&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Also the hand-optimized minifaction)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to credit Dave Gaur for coming up with minslides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me it was yet another reminder that browsers are "batteries included" for surprisingly many scenarios as long as you bother to dig into the APIs available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case-in-point: it turned out to be ridiculously simple to add note support in a second window!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, let me show you by switching between notes and slides with a keypress (&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, to be exact) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;div class="slide"&amp;gt; Anything in here is one slide (who needs components?) &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="slidenote"&amp;gt; (optional) Anything in here is a slide note for the slide above &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notes are optional, but must follow the slides that they are for. To switch to the note view, press n&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how to determine is something is a slide? Well, why not use plain old &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;slide&lt;/code&gt; class? And let's define slide notes as a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;slidenote&lt;/code&gt; class. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also lets us put anything in our slide that we are allowed to put into a plain webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, we can write a plain old markdown file (or whatever you prefer), and separate the slides by inserting those div tags (like I did for these slides, actually)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;div.slide, div.slidenote { height: 100vh; width: 100vw; /* Other slide styling options below */ ... ... }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it's that simple&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, we want our slides to be exactly as big as the screen in full-screen, and as big as the window when windowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out modern CSS has a ludicrously simple way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("slide");&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getElementsByClassName&lt;/code&gt; returns an array-like object with all children of the node it is called on (or the entire page is called on document, like we're doing here).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conveniently, these children will be in the order that they appear in the document&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we now have an array of all slides, in order. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("slide"), current = 0, jump = () =&amp;gt; slides[current].scrollIntoView(); jump();&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;code&gt;scrollIntoView()&lt;/code&gt; instantly jumps to the element that it is called on. And since our slide divs fill the screen, that is equivalent to changing a slide. Convenient!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can sneakily put other stuff around our slides and nobody will see it as long as we avoid scrolling manually!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many of you knew of &lt;code&gt;scrollIntoView&lt;/code&gt;? For the record, it's been supported since IE 8, Chrome 1 and Firefox 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;document.addEventListener("keypress", ({key}) =&amp;gt; { if(key === "j") current++; if(key === "k") current--; if(current &amp;lt; 0) current = 0; if(current &amp;gt;= slides.length) current = slides.length - 1; jump(); });&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with that we already have basic slide functionality!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All we have to do now for feature parity with minslides is add navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just add a listener for keypress events, change our &lt;code&gt;current&lt;/code&gt; variable and jump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, it's that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First version: add a &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; array synced to the &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt; array-like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;const notes = [...slides].map(slide =&amp;gt; { const note = slide.nextElementSibling; return note?.className === "slidenote" ? note : slide; });&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so to support notes, we want to check if a slide is followed by a div with &lt;code&gt;slidenote&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily, each element has a &lt;code&gt;nextElementSibling&lt;/code&gt; property that lets us fetch the node that follows it (if any).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we simply check that sibling's class name (if it exists, hence the optional chaining)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, remember how &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt; is an array-like instead of an actual array? Because of that we can't directly use map on it,
so we force it into an actual array with the spread syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify the jump function to pick slides or notes depending on view mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("slide"), current = 0, viewSlides = true, jump = () =&amp;gt; { if (viewSlides) slides[current].scrollIntoView(); else notes[current].scrollIntoView(); }; jump();&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we modify the jump function to jump to slides or notes depending on our view mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Straightforward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add key to switch modes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;document.addEventListener("keypress", ({key}) =&amp;gt; { if(key === "j") current++; if(key === "k") current--; if(current &amp;lt; 0){ current = 0; } if(current &amp;gt;= slides.length){ current = slides.length - 1; } if(key === "n") viewSlides = !viewSlides; jump(); });&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, then we also need a way to switch these mode. Let's pick &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;const bc = new BroadcastChannel("slide_switching_channel"); bc.onmessage = ({data}) =&amp;gt; { current = data.current; viewSlides = !data.viewSlides; jump(); }; document.addEventListener("keypress", ({key}) =&amp;gt; { /* ... the previous stuff ... */ bc.postMessage({current, viewSlides}); });&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Done! Multiple windows supported!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now all we're missing is having notes in a separate window synchronized with the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For that we can use a &lt;code&gt;BroadcastChannel&lt;/code&gt; to communicate state between open windows on the same url. It's basically event-based message passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we receive an event, we sync the &lt;code&gt;current&lt;/code&gt; value, then look at the view mode of the sender and pick the opposite, then jump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if the "notes" window has focus and moves a slide, the "slides" window is synced and forced to slide view, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;[slide, note]&lt;/code&gt; pairs, also shortens &lt;code&gt;jump()&lt;/code&gt; code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;let slides = [...document.getElementsByClassName("slide")] .map((slide, i) =&amp;gt; [ slide, (i = slide.nextElementSibling)?.className == "slidenote" ? i : slide ]), current = 0, viewSlides = 0, jump = () =&amp;gt; slides[current][viewSlides].scrollIntoView()&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, that's the readable version, but not the version I showed on the first slides. If I have time left I can explain the golf abuse, otherwise you'll have to read these slides on the internet later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's get rid of that branch in &lt;code&gt;jump&lt;/code&gt; by zipping slides and notes into one array of pairs, picking between the pair based on view mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, yes, we're abusing the fact that &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; lets us pass the index as a second parameter to shave some characters off of initializing a temporary variable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;bc.onmessage = ({data}) =&amp;gt; { viewSlides = data.viewSlides^1; current = data.current; jump(); }; document.addEventListener("keypress", ({key}) =&amp;gt; { if (key == "j") ++current; if (key == "k") --current; if (current &amp;lt; 0) current = 0; if (current &amp;gt;= slides.length) current = slides.length - 1; if (key == "n") viewSlides ^= 1; bc.postMessage({current, viewSlides}); jump(); });&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We made &lt;code&gt;viewSlides&lt;/code&gt; an integer, so we'll use xor bitmasking to switch it between zero and one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;let ..., l = slides.length-1; ... document.addEventListener("keypress", ({key}) =&amp;gt; { current += (key == "j") - (key == "k"); current = current &amp;lt; 0 ? 0 : current &amp;gt; l : l : current; viewSlides ^= (key == "n"); bc.postMessage({current, viewSlides}); jump(); });&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throw it through a minifier, do a bit of clean-up, and it's 371 bytes of JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's basically it! Throw this whole thing through a minifier (wrapped in a function so it's free to mangle variable names), do a bit of clean-up, and we end up with the 371 character minified version I showed at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is part one of a series of blog posts on temporaries, copies, return value optimization, and passing by value vs. reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good place to start, and the point of this first article, is how a prvalue isn’t necessarily a temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re entirely new to value categories (lvalues, rvalues etc.), you might want to read lvalues, rvalues, glvalues, prvalues, xvalues, help! first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;lvalues vs rvalues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An lvalue is an expression that can not be moved from. An rvalue is an expression that can be moved from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s first have a look at lvalues. Given this variable &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; v{1,2,3};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I now write the expression &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; somewhere, &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; is referring to an actual variable. I can’t just move from it, as it would mess up an existing object that someone else could still be using. We call an expression like this an lvalue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, if I pass my existing vector to a function &lt;code&gt;useVector&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
useVector(v);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the expression &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; is an lvalue, and &lt;code&gt;useVector&lt;/code&gt; can’t move from it. After all, someone might want to keep using &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; on a following line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if I know I won’t be needing &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; anymore, I can turn it into an rvalue, by wrapping it in &lt;code&gt;std::move&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
useVector(std::move(v));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the expression &lt;code&gt;std::move(v)&lt;/code&gt; is an rvalue. &lt;code&gt;useVector&lt;/code&gt; would now be allowed to move from &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;. (And I must take care to not use &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; again, since it might have been moved into &lt;code&gt;useVector&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;rvalues: xvalues vs prvalues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s another way to get an rvalue:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
useVector(std::vector{1,2,3});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the expression &lt;code&gt;std::vector{1,2,3}&lt;/code&gt; is also an rvalue, and again &lt;code&gt;useVector&lt;/code&gt; would be allowed to move from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice, however, that these are two different types of rvalues. &lt;code&gt;std::move(v)&lt;/code&gt; takes an existing object and casts it to an rvalue. That type of rvalue is called an xvalue, or “eXpiring lvalue”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;code&gt;std::vector{1,2,3}&lt;/code&gt; is a prvalue, or “pure rvalue”. Unlike an xvalue, this expression never referred to an existing object in the first place. People sometimes call this “a temporary”, but, as is the main point of this article, that’s not necessarily true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A prvalue in itself is not a temporary. A prvalue is not an object. A prvalue just represents “the idea of the object”, and only turns into a temporary when it absolutely needs to. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
std::vector v = std::vector{1,2,3};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the prvalue &lt;code&gt;std::vector{1,2,3}&lt;/code&gt; does not turn into a temporary that is then used to initialize &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;. Rather, the prvalue is used to initialize &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; directly, just as if you’d written &lt;code&gt;std::vector v{1,2,3};&lt;/code&gt;. No extra temporary is created, and no copies or moves are performed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void useVector(std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; v);

useVector(std::vector{1,2,3});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;useVector&lt;/code&gt; takes its parameter by value. &lt;code&gt;std::vector{1,2,3}&lt;/code&gt; never turns into a temporary, the prvalue expression is instead used to initialize the parameter &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; directly, just like in the previous example. No extra temporary is created, and no copies of moves are performed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Temporary materialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if &lt;code&gt;useVector&lt;/code&gt; takes its parameter by reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
void useVector(const std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;amp; v);

useVector(std::vector{1,2,3});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the reference parameter &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; needs some object to bind to, and &lt;code&gt;std::vector{1,2,3}&lt;/code&gt; actually turns into a temporary object that &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; can bind to. This is called “temporary materialization”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Return values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A function call that returns by value is also a prvalue 1. So, given this definition of &lt;code&gt;getVector()&lt;/code&gt; and a call to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; getVector();

std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; v = getVector();
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the call &lt;code&gt;getVector()&lt;/code&gt; is a prvalue which initializes &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; directly. There is no temporary that is then copied/moved into &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;. (There might be a copy involved in the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement inside &lt;code&gt;getVector()&lt;/code&gt;, but that’s a story for the next article.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is that a prvalue only materializes into a temporary as a very last resort, avoiding unnecessary copies or moves. Until it needs to materialize, it only represents “the idea of the object”, i.e. what the object would be when it materializes into a temporary or is used to initialize something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this has nothing to do with optimization. There is no temporary &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt; to optimize away in the first place, there’s just the prvalue, just the “idea of the object”. And then that idea of an object can materialize into an actual object if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The season we hoped would never come is here.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is with a great appreciation and heartfelt emotions that we write to share some sad news. After more than 200 years of sharing a unique blend of weather, wit and wisdom, we’ve made the very difficult decision to write the final chapter of this historical publication. The 2026 Farmers’ Almanac will be our last edition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of you grew up hearing your parents or grandparents quote from the Almanac, always having a copy nearby. Maybe you have planted by our Moon phases, consulted the Almanac for the “Best Days” to potty train, wean, or go fishing. We’re grateful to have been part of your life and trust that you’ll help keep the spirit of the Almanac alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are incredibly proud of the legacy we leave behind and are filled with gratitude. We appreciate and thank our loyal readers, contributors, and partners who have supported us through the years. Though the Almanac will no longer be available in print or online, it lives on within you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So go ahead—plant your peas when the daffodils bloom. Watch for a red sky at night. Tell the kids how granddad always swore by the Almanac. That’s how our story stays alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With deepfelt appreciation,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandi Duncan and Peter Geiger&lt;lb/&gt;Editor and Editor Emeritus&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. Copies of the 2026 Farmers’ Almanac are currently available on FarmersAlmanac.com, Amazon.com, and at these local stores. You will be able to access our website until December 2025.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;dead framework theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are my opinions and are ruminations on what might be happening as more and more developers use LLMs and Frameworks to build on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October last year I wrote “will developers care about frameworks in the future?” predicting that LLMs would abstract away framework choice. I was wrong—or at least, wrong about the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality is more interesting and more permanent: React isn’t competing with other frameworks anymore. React has become the platform. And if you’re building a new framework, library or browser feature today, you need to understand that you’re not just competing with React—you’re competing against a self-reinforcing feedback loop between LLM training data, system prompts, and developer output that makes displacing React functionally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at what Replit, Bolt, and similar tools are doing, they’re not trying to abstract away frameworks—they’re explicitly hardcoding React into their system prompts. They have to. If you’re building a tool today to attract developers, you need to give them code they can maintain. And “code developers can maintain” now means “React” for the vast majority of web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to builtwith.com, there were +13m sites outside of the top 1m deployed with React in the last 12 months. Look at these curves:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, looking at HTTP Archive, it tells a different story. React usage has stalled at 1.2 million mobile origins on mobile vs 55 million origins as reported by Builtwith.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dataset sizes are vastly different. HTTP Archive looks over some 12-16 million origins, while Builtwith is reportedly looking at some 414 million root domains. Sites also don’t get into HTTP Archive unless there is some amount of usage and many sites in Builtwith might be parked domains or sites that are not actively being used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the top 1m, the detection rate is more aligned: 140k vs 160k.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re looking at about 12-18% of sites in the top 1m. Take all these numbers with a pinch of salt. The detection can be broken, the datasets are different sizes and the definitions of what is being measured are different. But the trends feel undeniable: React’s growth continues while competitors like Angular, sadly stagnate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what has driven the uptick in React sites? My read of the data suggests LLM tools over the last 12-18 months are preferring to output React code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at token growth on OpenRouter. Programming tools are burning through billions of tokens a day via just one gateway. The curves look similar:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correlation is not causation, and only the tool creators see the full picture as tokens flow through their systems. But the timing is striking: massive token growth coinciding with massive React deployment growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The models and the tools are preferring the tools that developers are already using, and it’s driving a self-reinforcing cycle of adoption. If you are launching a new API or tool today, you need to consider how it will be adopted by the ecosystem and how to get it into the training corpus of the LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have two loops of feedback in play here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;React dominates the existing web (~13M+ new sites in 12 months)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs train on the existing web&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs output React by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New sites built with LLMs use React&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More React sites exist for future training&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to step 2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;React dominates the developer ecosystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IDEs and tools that developers preferntially output React&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools ask LLMs to output React by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New sites built are using React&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More React sites exist to increase demand for tools to output React&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to step 1&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t actually know if this is bad or good. We’re getting more sites on the web and they’re all pretty high quality. But it does create barriers for new frameworks, tools and web platform features that we need to understand. Specifically when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your framework isn’t in the training data because it’s new&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool creators hardcode React because that’s what developers know today&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developers expect React output because that’s what works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Companies won’t use your framework if their developers can’t maintain it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;React has thousands of libraries; you have dozens&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you launch a new framework, library or browser feature today, even if it’s technically superior, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get into LLM training data (12-18 month lag minimum)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Convince tool creators to modify system prompts (requires existing adoption)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build a comprehensive library ecosystem (years of development)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overcome developer inertia and get developers to ask for it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time you’ve done step 1, the ecosystem using React has generated another 10M+ sites. You might flip that order, and do a massive campaign to get developer mind share, and supplement it with paid integrations in to the library ecosystem. We might even see new business models where framework and library authors pay tooling providers to include their framework in system prompts. But even then, you’re fighting against entrenched patterns in both React libraries AND LLM training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t about React being the best tool or that it’s Model is good for LLMs (I don’t see any evidence there at all). It’s about React being past the point where network effects make alternatives viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what brought this home for me: Last week I used Claude to build a Chrome Extension using Chrome’s built-in &lt;code&gt;prompt&lt;/code&gt; API. Claude dutifully wrote the entire extension, but used &lt;code&gt;self.ai.languageModel&lt;/code&gt;—the API from 6 months ago. The current API is &lt;code&gt;LanguageModel.create()&lt;/code&gt;, but that wasn’t in the training corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add in the fact that it can take years of Interop work to get a feature to the point it becomes “Baseline newly-available” and then another 30 months for it to reach a point where it’s “Baseline widely-available”. By that time, the ecosystem has moved on, and the feature is competing against entrenched patterns in both React libraries AND LLM training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the new reality: If it’s not in the LLM training data, it doesn’t exist. Not for 12-18 months, at least not until the next model training cycle and not until enough examples exist in the wild to statistically matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now apply this to frameworks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web platform APIs: 0-6 months of real-world usage before training cutoff&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New frameworks: 0-6 months of real-world usage before training cutoff&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;React patterns: 10+ years of accumulated examples&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, if your framework or documentation isn’t in the training corpus of the LLM, then it won’t be output. If the system prompt of the tool a developer uses doesn’t have your API, library or framework, then it’s not in the output. And if the user of a tool doesn’t ask for a specific API, library or framework, then it won’t be output. Model providers are skewing it so the model prefers a certain style, or framework or library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same dynamic applies to new web platform APIs designed to replace framework features. Consider the typical pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser teams identify a common pattern in frameworks (e.g., CSS Nesting instead of Sass)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-year standardization process begins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feature ships in browsers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developers… keep using the framework pattern&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The LLM learned the old pattern: Sass has 15 years of examples; CSS Nesting has 1 or 2 years&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The framework already works: React developers use styled-components, Tailwind, CSS modules&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The ecosystem is built: Thousands of React component libraries use existing CSS patterns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There’s no incentive to switch: The new platform feature doesn’t make the site better for users&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;People loved Sass, but you need a build-step, so we have CSS Nesting. However its rarely output because preprocessor patterns are more common in the corpus and also React developers already have CSS-in-JS solutions that LLMs know how to output.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Carousels are hard to build, so maybe we should have them as an intrinsic part of the platform. But there are tons of libraries that create great carousels that are already in LLM training data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an author of many sites, I love these features. CSS Nesting alone lets me structure my CSS in a way that I personally find easier to read and maintain. But it doesn’t really change the quality of the experience of the site for the person using my site. It doesn’t change the performance of the site. It doesn’t change how accessible my site is. It just makes it easier for me to write and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only new platform features that matter are ones that can’t be built in user-space, like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-page view transitions (new navigation capabilities)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WebGPU (fundamentally new compute access)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WebAuthN and PassKeys (security primitives)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else is competing against entrenched patterns in both React libraries AND LLM training data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s at least 3 constituencies to consider here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The “head” businesses building on the web - The top 1000 sites take the lion’s share of traffic and revenue on the web, and we don’t see massive technology shifts in the top 1000 through to top 1 million because these are established sites with established teams and shifting technology is hard with often unclear benefit outside of potential improvements to product velocity. They are likely to be using LLM based tooling to help increase velocity, but they are not going to be switching frameworks or libraries lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The “middle” businesses building on the web - The next 10 million sites are being built by small teams and individuals and will likely be using LLMs to build new sites completely and unless they prompt will use the defaults the tools output&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The “long tail” - These are people who are not formal web developers who will use tools like Loveable, Replit, or even directly in a chat app. They may never need to look at the code, so what do any of these new APIs do to help them build better sites? and they represent the growth in the platform and we have an opportunity for millions more people to deploy on to the web&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people in groups 2 and 3 are the ones driving the growth in sites on the web and are unlikely to be building with these tools don’t know about Passkeys, WebAuthn, Web Components, CSS Nesting, View Transitions, or any of the other new features being added to the platform. They just want a site created that does what they need it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, the normal people using the web don’t care about the tools, frameworks and libraries are not something that concerns a normal person using the web. What concerns people is the experience of using the page. Does it load quickly enough? Are the interactions smooth? Does the site actually do what I need it to do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, if you are a company targeting developers in any of those categories (LLM or a tool that outputs code from an LLM), to not output React by default is to limit your potential audience as your competitors are serving the current demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now consider the current working model for code-generating LLM tools which reflect the ecosystem that they are trained on. This means that any new API, framework or library has a large hurdle to get over in terms of being something that will be output by the tool. The fact that any new feature might not be in the training corpus and will not be prevalent enough to have its usage patterns and idioms ingrained in the training and by extension the output of an LLM should be a concern to the people building new platform features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at today’s trend of tools primarily outputting React code, the comprehensive ecosystem of user-space libraries can do almost everything from custom select boxes, specialized date components and everything else. I can’t see a world where a new platform feature is going to displace the libraries in use nor can I see a world where a new framework is going to displace React in the short to medium term—I really love what the Remix folks are doing with Remix 3 and I will keenly watch how it is adopted and how LLMs might pick this up to see how this post plays out in the real world. I’d love to see how long it takes for LLMs to start outputting Remix code without specific prompting or including docs in the context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For framework authors: Building a new framework is building a product that LLMs won’t output for 12-18 months minimum, that has no library ecosystem, that developers don’t know, and that companies won’t adopt. You’re not competing with React’s technical merits—you’re competing with React’s statistical dominance in every LLM training corpus and every tools providers preference for their customer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For platform developers: Developer experience features (syntactic sugar, convenience APIs) are competing against established React patterns in LLM training data. They will not be adopted at scale. Focus on fundamental capabilities that can’t be built in user-space. For features that browser developers are creating today, we need to take a long hard look at the benefits that they will bring to the user and not the developer. To that extent, many of the platform features ranging from Web Components through to syntactical changes are just not needed by the vast majority of people building sites in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For tool creators (e.g, IDEs): If you’re not outputting React by default, you’re limiting your addressable market. Your competitors are serving current demand. You can’t afford to be principled about framework diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dead framework theory isn’t about frameworks dying. It’s about new frameworks being dead on arrival in a world where React has become the platform (at least as long as people need to maintain code.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an industry we should absolutely innovate and build new frameworks, libraries and platform features. We need innovation to push the web forward and create competition. But we need to be aware of the dynamics at play and have clear strategies to get our work into LLM training corpus, system prompts, and developer minds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the industry continues its current focus on maintainability and developer experience, we’ll end up in a world where the web is built by LLMs using React and a handful of libraries entrenched in the training data. Framework innovation stagnates. Platform innovation focuses elsewhere. React becomes infrastructure—invisible and unchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s the optimistic take: If LLM usage continues to grow, tooling vendors will have to compete with each other on this homogenized ecosystem. When everyone outputs React by default, you can’t differentiate on framework choice. You have to compete on output quality. Market forces shift the focus from developer experience to user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For either scenario, we need to start competing on user outcomes. I really want to see Evals and Benchmarks that focus on quality outcomes like Core Web Vitals did for performance. When tools compete to attract users, the ones that output meaningfully better experiences will win. This competitive pressure will incentivize the entire ecosystem to optimize for users, not developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if we succeed? Then in the long run, the framework will become irrelevant as the models improve to the point people manipulate sites by words alone and the LLM providers believe they can create better outcomes with their own frameworks or tuning (hat tip to Ade). The delivery technology becomes an optimized compiled output that meets user needs—whether it’s “React” or something else stops mattering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the raw, naked, web platform? Focus on fundamentally new capabilities—the things that can’t be built in user-space, or where there’s clear user-experience benefit that can’t be achieved with libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;**Leaving Meta and PyTorch**
It's finally time...
November 6th, 2025
[https://soumith.ch/blog.html](https://soumith.ch/blog.html)
Eleven years at Meta. Nearly all my professional life. Making many friends for life. Almost eight years leading PyTorch, taking it from nothing to 90%+ adoption in AI. Walking away from this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I'm leaving with a full heart.
PyTorch handles exascale training now. It powers foundation models that are redefining intelligence. It's in production at virtually every major AI company. It's taught in classrooms from MIT to rural India. The tools I dreamed about making accessible? They are. The barrier to entry I wanted to lower? It's almost gone.
To be clear, there’s so much more to do. As long as AI evolves at a breakneck pace, PyTorch will continue to play catch up. Obsessing over the yet-to-come sometimes makes us forget how much we’ve already done.
To everyone who built this with me—who believed research should be joyful, that tools should be elegant, that open source changes everything—thank you. This wasn't my journey. It was ours.
What's next for me? Something small. Something new. Something I don't fully understand yet. Something uncomfortable. I could have moved to something else inside Meta. But I needed to know what's out there. I needed to do something small again. I couldn't live with the counterfactual regret of never trying something outside Meta.
It's very hard to leave. I probably have one of the AI industry’s most leveraged seats, I lead the software layer that powers the entire AI industry. Every major AI company and hardware vendor are on a speed dial. This kind of power is really hard to give up. But curiosity ultimately won out in my head.
Keep making AI delicious and accessible. I'll be watching. Probably filing issues. Definitely staying involved.
# Is PyTorch going to be okay?
I don't want to be doing PyTorch forever. I don't want to be like Guido or Linus— bound to a single thing for decades. Last November, coinciding with the birth of my daughter, I started planning my exit with Aparna. My goal was to leave PyTorch in a good and stable place.
By this August, during the second half of my parental leave, I knew: Edward, Suo, Alban, Greg, John, Joe and Jana were ready. The team faced hard people, product, technical and organizational problems and didn’t feel the need to lean back on me to solve these for them (unlike in the past). The product story they crafted for the PyTorch Conference was coherent—really coherent. The things I'd flagged red were turning healthy. The project didn't need me anymore. Unlike 2020-2022 (when I stepped down to go do robotics and came back when Lin, Dima and Dwarak left), I have strong confidence that this time PyTorch is truly resilient. The most aligned culture carriers of PyTorch – Greg, Alban, Ed, Jason and Joe are at the decision table now, and people with strong value alignment – Suo, John and Jana have joined them at the table. And there’s a long list of equally value-aligned people willing to sit at the table should any of these people leave. There are many little things that make up my confidence on the people – John worked on Julia and open-source for a very long time (in fact we hacked a Torch.jl in 2015), Suo has been the strongest systems builder and strategic partner I’ve had for the past two years, and Jana worked on resilient core systems for a very long time, I’ve had long technical and organizational discussions with her over the past few months that give me confidence. And the product lineup and execution in 2025 should be sufficient evidence for any remaining doubt.
I’m confident that this band of PyTorchers are going to do exceptionally well. PyTorch might change in flavor because I no longer impose my own taste from the top, but I’m confident that the values are going to stay intact and the product is going to be awesome.

# My time at Meta
The early years of FAIR were absolutely magical. I was part of a small family of absolutely brilliant people building state-of-the-art AI out in the open. From working on GANs with Emily Denton, Rob Fergus, Leon Bottou, Martin Arjovsky and the (now legendary) Alec Radford to building Starcraft bots with Gabriel Synnaeve, to building the first FAIR Cluster with Howard Mansell, to working on object detection with Adam Lerer and Piotr Dollar, to building PyTorch. It was more fun than I can describe in words. 2015 and 2016 were probably the most productive and professionally enjoyable years of my life. I’ll probably romanticize this period of my life forever.
When I joined FAIR, I had massive impostor syndrome, and the first 3 months were very very difficult. I can’t credit Andrew Tulloch enough for being the most thoughtful, kind and welcoming mentor, without whom I wouldn’t have made it. I’m so damn bullish for Meta just from the fact that he’s back.

My time on PyTorch was special.
I loved every part of building it—designing it, managing it, being the PM, TL, comms lead, doc engineer, release engineer, squashing bugs, growth hacking, turning it into a coherent product with hundreds of people, transitioning it to industry stakeholdership – the whole nine yards.
To the core PyTorch team at Meta: the engineers, researchers, open-source maintainers, docs writers, CI infrastructure folks, hardware partners, the community builders. To the hundreds more inside and outside Meta—thank you. You turned a library into a movement.
There are too many people to credit and thank, but I can't not mention Adam Paszke, Sam Gross, Greg Chanan, Joe Spisak, Alban Desmaison, Edward Yang, Richard Zou, Tongzhou Wang, Francisco Massa, Luca Antiga, Andreas Köpf, Zach DeVito, Zeming Lin, Adam Lerer, Howard Mansell and Natalia Gimelshein. And Schrep. They made the launch happen. And so many more people became centrally important later: Lu Fang, Xiaodong Wang, Junjie Bai, Nikita Shulga, Horace He, Mark Saroufim, Jason Ansel, Dmytro Dzhulgakov, Yangqing Jia, Geeta Chauhan, Will Constable, Briah Hirsh, Jane Xu, Mario Lezcano, Piotr Balecki, Yinghai Lu, Less Wright, Andrew Tulloch, Bruce Lin, Woo Kim, Helen Suk, Chris Gottbrath, Peng Wu, Joe Isaacson, Eli Uriegas, Tristan Rice, Yanan Cao, Elias Ellison, Animesh Jain, Peter Noordhuis, Tianyu Liu, Yifu Wang, Lin Qiao and hundreds more. It’s criminal of me to not take the space to list out everyone else I should be mentioning here. PyTorch is nothing without its people ❤️.
The most joyful moments of building PyTorch was meeting users eager to share their happiness, love and feedback. I remember a grad student coming to me at Neurips 2017, in a slurring emotional voice he said he’d been trying to make progress on his research for 3 years but within 3 months of using PyTorch he made so much progress that he was ready to graduate. That moment made it tangible that what we do matters, a lot, to a lot of people, even if you don't constantly hear from them. I do miss the intimacy of the PyTorch community, with a 300 person conference that felt like an extended family gathering, but I feel that’s a small price to pay considering the scale of impact PyTorch is truly having today – yes the Conference is now 3,000 people where market-moving deals get brokered, but it’s helping orders of magnitude more people to do their best AI work. I miss the intimacy, but I'm proud of that growth.

To Mark Zuckerberg and Mike Schroepfer, who believed that open-sourcing is fundamentally important and is a sound business strategy. This is so hard to understand for most people within the course of business, but we’ve run lock-step on this strategy without ever having to discuss it. Without you two, neither FAIR nor PyTorch would’ve happened. And those mean so much to me.
To Yann LeCun and Rob Fergus, for building the magical early FAIR that I so revere.
To Aparna Ramani, a leader that I find so rare at Meta in her ability to hold a really high bar for the org, technically brilliant with the span to discuss deep infra systems and industry-strategy within the same conversation and for being an absolute execution-machine! I’ve learned so much from you.
To Santosh, Kaushik, Delia, Oldham and Ben for being so welcoming to Infra. For someone coming over from FAIR with a wildly different culture, you all made me feel at home and made me part of the family, and thank you for that.
To all my managers who've championed me through the PSC video game – Serkan, Howard, Jerome, Abhijit, Yoram, Joelle, Aparna and Damien – I owe you a lifetime of drinks.

Signing off for now.
