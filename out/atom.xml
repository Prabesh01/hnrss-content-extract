  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This manual documents the building of an electric resistance heating element that is directly connected to a solar panel, without a battery, charge controller, or voltage regulator in between. The heating element is used in the insulated solar electric cooker that we describe in another manual, and in the solar-powered coffee maker and footstove that we will document in forthcoming manuals. We also describe a method to make a removable heat brick, which we use to replace the commercial heating elements in some earlier electric solar cooker prototypes we made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A custom-made electric resistance consists of an electric circuit made of nichrome wire, enclosed in a mortar layer. The length and thickness of the nichrome wire determine its current draw at a certain voltage, meaning that you dimension the circuit to your solar panel voltage and power rating to optimize heat generation. The nichrome circuit is connected to the electric cables of the solar panel, with a short section of heat-resistant electric cable in between. 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why build an electric resistance heating from scratch?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We initially used commercial heating elements in our first solar oven prototypes, which yielded disappointing results. Therefore, we decided to build our own, based on the manual provided by the Living Energy Farm. Building your own heating element involves extra work, but it’s worth the effort. It’s also a lot cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many commercial heating elements have built-in thermostats, which can complicate temperature regulation inside the oven. They also require a voltage input that does not align with the voltage output of most solar panels, which introduces the need for an extra electronic component (a buck converter). Securely fixing commercial heating elements proved to be difficult as well, and we had trouble keeping moisture away from the electrical system, which at one point resulted in an electrical fire. By embedding a self-made heating element in a mortar base, we solved all these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is electric resistance heating?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric resistance refers to the difficulty that the flow of electric current encounters when it passes through a material. It’s comparable to friction in mechanical systems. Resistance creates heat, as described by Joule’s Law. Electric resistance is measured in ohms (Ω).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resistance of a piece of wire depends on its material’s resistivity, but also on its length and thickness. Metals have low electrical resistance, meaning that electricity easily flows through them; they are called “conductors”. For example, electric wires are usually made of copper, which has very low electric resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, materials such as plastic, rubber, and ceramics have very high electric resistance, meaning that electricity doesn’t flow easily through them. These materials are known as “insulators”. For example, electric wires are encapsulated in plastic, which makes them safe to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric heating elements, such as those used in ovens, toasters, and hair dryers, are commonly made of nichrome wire, an alloy of nickel and chromium that has relatively high resistance for a metal. Electrons can pass through, but because they encounter quite some resistance, the nichrome wire dissipates a lot of heat. It glows orange when it heats up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you need&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the components list below, we link to Amazon, using it as a global inventory of components. Feel free—and be encouraged—to buy the components locally, or scavenge them from old appliances. We do not earn anything if you purchase on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nichrome wire. Other example. Nichrome wire is sold in either bobbins or spools. You can also scavenge it from old ovens, toasters, hair driers, and other electric heating devices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Heat-resistant electric cable. These electric wires are encapuslated in silicone mesh rather than plastic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thermal switch (optional).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thermal fuse (optional).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Construction mortar for encapsulating the nichrome circuit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thick tiles (in case you build a removable heat brick).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calculate the resistance value&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge in building an electric resistance heating element is determining the correct length of the nichrome circuit to match the voltage and current rating of the power source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine the length of the nichrome circuit, you need to calculate the desired resistance value that corresponds to your power source. You can calculate it using Ohm’s law, which defines the relation between voltage (Volts, V), current (Ampere, A), and resistance (Ohm, Ω):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resistance (Ω) = U (V) / I (A)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine the voltage and current values of your solar panel, refer to the label attached to the back of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the voltage, check the “Maximum Power Voltage (Vmax)” or “Voltage at Pmax”. That refers to the maximum voltage that a solar panel can provide when connected to an electric circuit. Ignore the “Voltage Open Circuit (VOC)”, which is the maximum voltage the solar panel produces if nothing is attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a so-called 12V solar panel (so-called because it’s typically used in conjunction with a 12V battery and solar charge controller), the Vmax is approximately 18V. For a so-called 24V solar panel (meant to be used in combination with a 24V battery and charge controller), it’s around 36V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the current, check the “Maximum Power Current (IMP)” or “Current at Pmax”. Ignore the “Short Circuit Current”. If the label is missing, measure the voltage with a multimeter. You can calculate the current once you know the voltage and power output: electric current equals the power output (100W in our case) divided by the voltage (18V in our case). The maximum current that our 100W solar panel can produce is therefore 5.55 A.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you know the voltage and current of your solar panel, you can calculate the desired resistance value for the heating element using Ohm’s Law. In our case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18 (V) / 5.55 (A) = 3.24 Ω&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calculate the length of the heating wire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step is to cut a piece of nichrome wire that has a resistance of 3.24 Ω. Nichrome wire is sold in various thicknesses, each with a different resistance value. The thinner (and longer) a resistive wire is, the higher its resistance will be. The resistance of a nichrome wire is indicated in ohms per distance (for example, Ω/m).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We purchased a relatively thin Nichrome wire with a rated resistance of 8.71 Ω/m. Following the mathematical Rule of Three, based on the resistance per meter, we find that our nichrome circuit needs to be 37.2 cm long to have a resistance value of 3.24 Ω: (100 * 3.24) / 8.71 = 37.2 cm. If you start with a different thickness of Nichrome wire (anything goes), you will obtain a different length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t trust the labeling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the resistance value on the nichrome wire packaging isn’t always exact. To obtain a more accurate measurement, cut precisely one metre of nichrome wire and connect it to the solar panel (or to an 18V test station - see further below) with a watt-meter or multimeter in between. Follow the same method when you use scavenged nichrome wire from an appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect one end of the wire to the positive output of the solar panel or test station, and the other to the negative output, forming an electric circuit. The polarity doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn the power on, read the amperage and wattage values on your watt meter, and turn it off immediately afterward. Be careful when connecting the wire; make sure it doesn’t touch itself, as this would create a shorter circuit for the electricity. Your measurement will be inaccurate, but it will also draw a lot more current (A) and heat much faster, which can be dangerous. Make sure you don’t touch it either because it gets very hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing this, we measured 31W at 1.76A and 18V. Based on Ohm’s Law, we calculated that 18 V / 1.76 A = 10.2 Ω. Consequently, our wire has a resistance of 10.2 Ω/m rather than 8.71 Ω/m. That means that it should have a length of 31.7 cm to have a resistance value of 3.24 Ω:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(100 * 3.24) / 10.2 = 31.7 cm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Doubling or tripling the cable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it’s still too early to cut the nichrome wire to size. Depending on the wire’s resistive value that you are starting with, the length that results from your calculation may not be the most practical length for spreading the heat evenly across the surface of your heating or cooking appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the bottom part of our solar oven chamber, right above the electric resistance heating element, measures 26x33 centimeters. With a circuit less than 32 cm long, it’s impossible to heat the oven chamber evenly. A short wire would also create a very warm spot in the mortar and damage it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can be solved by connecting two or more nichrome wires in parallel. If you double the circuit, each wire should be twice as long (63,4 cm each in our case) to keep the same resistance value. If you triple the circuit, each wire should be three times as long (95,1 cm each), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may feel counterintuitive, but the longer a cable is, the higher its resistance becomes: electrons will have more difficulty travelling through it. When you double the nichrome cicuit by creating two parallel wires, the electrons can flow in two circuits simultaneously, which means the resitance is halved. Therefore, to keep the same resistance value of 3.24 ohm, you have to make this double circuit twice as long. The same logic applies to a triple wires, where you have to make the circuit three times as long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cut the nichrome wire to size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have decided on the number of nichrome circuits, cut the wires to size. However, before you do that, add about 4 cm to every wire. You will need this extra length to solder the nichrome wire to the heat-resistant electric cables (see further).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Coiling the wire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doubling the circuit, as we did in our solar oven, quadruples the total circuit length. That turns one problem (a too-short cable) into another one (too-long cables). However, it can be solved by coiling the wire, which has an additional advantage: The thin nichrome wire becomes much easier to handle and bend when it’s coiled like a spring. You can do this by wrapping it tightly around a rod-shaped object, such as a pen or a screwdriver. Next, you pull the wire to extend it slightly again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thermal switch and fuse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An electric resistance heating element needs a safety precaution to prevent overheating, which could become a fire hazard or crack the mortar enclosure. If the heating element is connected to a solar panel without a battery, as is the case for our solar oven, you could argue that it already has a safety precaution: the sun sets every evening, cutting off the power source to the heating element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you also want to run the cooking appliance on a battery or with a grid-powered test station, you should add a safety precaution that cuts off the heating element if you forget to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to do that is to add a timer switch. That is a component that controls an electric switch and turns it off after a predetermined time has elapsed. The second approach, which we chose, is to add a thermal switch and a thermal fuse. These components disconnect the circuit when the heating element reaches a certain temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thermal switch cuts off the heating circuit when its temperature reaches the rated temperature, and turns it back on when the temperature drops below a slightly lower value. The thermal fuse is an extra safety measure: it’s a single-use fuse that blows when it reaches its rated temperature. The thermal fuse should have a higher value than the thermal switch. You embed it in the cement layer, and once it blows, it’s impossible to replace without breaking the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We selected a switch with a maximum temperature rating of 200°C (392°F) and a fuse with a maximum temperature rating of 240°C (464°F). Note that the temperature measured inside the oven chamber will be lower than the temperature of the electric heating element. For example, our thermal switch turns off the circuit at 200°C when the oven chamber is around 120°C (248°F).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can choose a thermal switch and fuse with a higher temperature. However, we cannot guarantee that the structural materials we used for our oven can withstand higher temperatures than those we use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect the thermal switch and the thermal fuse in series (one after the other) between the nichrome circuit and the positive heat-resistant wire (the one that connects to the positive wire of the solar panel). Ensure the fuse and switch are embedded in the mortar to obtain an accurate temperature reading. Both switch and fuse have no polarity, which means you can connect their pins in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Solder the nichrome wires to the electric cables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the nichrome circuit is cut and coiled, you need to connect it to the electric cables from the solar PV panel. However, you cannot simply solder one to the other: the nichrome wires get hot and would burn the plastic casing of the electric cables. To prevent that, you need to install a pair of heat-resistant electric cables in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you solder the nichrome wire to the heat-resistance cable. If you want to add a switch and/or fuse (see above), it should go in between the heat-resistant cable and the nichrome wire. Then, you connect the heat-resistant cables to normal electric cables or directly to the solar panel cables (using any type of connector). You also want to put an on-off switch in the positive wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, the circuit components should be connected in the following order: positive PV cable, on/off switch, heat-resistant cable, (optional) thermal switch, (optional) thermal fuse, and nichrome circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soldering the nichrome wire to the heat-resistant electric cable is a bit complicated because the nichrome doesn’t stick with tin solder. However, you can get around that problem. Start by applying tin to your stripped heat-resistant electric cable strand (fig2.). Then, coil a few centimeters of the nichrome wire around the cable ends (these are the extra centimeters you added before cutting the nichrome wire to size) (fig 3.). Next, apply a generous amount of tin on top of the twisted wire to trap it onto the cable (fig4.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric cables come in different thicknesses, measured in mm² in Europe or AWG in the US. The higher the current that flows through it, the thicker an electric cable needs to be. Our circuit works at 5.555A, which requires a 1.5 mm² core wire area. The US equivalent is 16 or 14 AWG. Both the heat-resistant wire and the standard electric cable should follow this size requirement. If you have a different current draw, refer to the chart below to determine the required size. If you plan to use a very long cable between the solar panel and the cooking device, choose a thicker cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Encapsulating the heating element&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the electric resistance heating element is ready, it needs to be encapsulated in mortar, a heat-resistant material with high thermal inertia. We describe two methods for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Encapsulte the heating element in the device itself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first method involves encapsulating the nichrome circuit within the structure of a specific cooking or heating appliance. That is how our electric solar oven works: the heating element is embedded into a layer of mortar at the bottom of the cooker, between the insulation layer and the oven chamber (where the food goes). See the manual for the construction steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Encapsulate the heating element in a removable heat brick&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second method yields a tiled heating brick that can be inserted into various cooking appliances. In this case, the nichrome circuit is embedded in construction mortar and sandwiched between two identical tiles. The two heat-resistant electric cables protrude from one side, ready to be connected to a solar panel. It’s essential to use somewhat thicker and stronger tiles for this purpose, for example, terracotta floor or roof tiles. Thinner tiles may shatter due to the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use these removable heating bricks to power the first two solar oven prototypes that we made. It’s a less energy-efficient method, but if the nichrome circuit breaks, you don’t need to rebuild the entire cooking device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Living Energy Farm, which inspired the building of our own resistance heating elements, casts the nichrome circuit into a metal shell that they make themselves using sheet metal. However, in contrast to a tiled heating brick, a sheet metal casing requires skills and tools that are not so common. 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Assembly of the heating brick&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;fig 1-2. Place one of the tiles with the back side facing up, apply a dollop of mortar, and flatten it across the tile, almost to the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;fig 3. Place the electric resistance circuit on top of the mortar. Make sure the wires don’t touch or cross, as this would create a short circuit. Try to evenly distribute the wire across the surface to distribute the heat evenly, but avoid the edges to prevent the nichrome wire from sticking out. Leave at least 3-5 cm of heat-resistant electric wire protruding from the tile on one side, so that you can solder or otherwise connect it to a standard electrical cable.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;fig 4-6. Add a little bit of mortar on the other tile and press it on top of the other like a sandwich. Leave it to dry out for at least 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up a test station for electric heating resistance heaters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A test station is convenient for testing resistance heating elements designed to operate on solar panels. Such a test station consists of a DC power supply and a buck or boost converter. It allows you to simulate the solar panel’s power output using grid power. A test station also serves to measure the precise resistance value of 1m of nichrome wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 12V or 24V DC power supply converts 110/220-240V AC power into DC power, comparable to the electricity produced by a solar panel. Choose one with a capacity of at least the power output of your solar panel (100W in our case). If you connect a buck or boost converter to it, you can manipulate the 12V or 24V output voltage into a higher or a lower voltage. Since our heating resistance runs on a solar panel without a battery or charge controller (Vmax = 18V), you can match the buck or boost converter to an output of 18V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To wire it, connect a + and - cable to the DC supply into the buck or boost converter. Use a boost converter to step up the voltage from a DC supply below 18V, or a buck converter to lower he voltage drom a 24V power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you build an electric heating resistance that you want to run on a 12V or 24V battery, you only need the DC power supply (with a voltage output of 12 or 24V, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are short on cash, you can use a laptop adapter instead of a DC power supply. The DC output of a laptop adapter is printed on the adapter itself. It’s typically around 70-90W at 19-20V. While it won’t be able to power a 100W solar cooker at full strength, it’s suitable for testing the circuit, and you can obtain it for free. If you have a lot of money, you can also purchase an adjustable lab DC supply, which allows you to adjust the voltage and current outputs using knobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other types of power sources&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you want to build a heating element that runs on a 12V or 24V battery and solar charge controller, the voltage value for your calculation is 12V or 24V, respectively. The current depends on the wattage that you want to achieve. For example, if you have a 12V power source and you want a 100W heating element, you need 8.33A. If you have a 24V power source and you want a 100W heating element, you need 4.17A.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Abandoned land drives dangerous heat in Houston, Texas A&amp;amp;M study finds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research highlights how a lack of vegetation and shade exposes vulnerable residents to heightened health risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a scorching Texas afternoon, some Houston neighborhoods heat up far faster than others. New research from Texas A&amp;amp;M University shows vacant and abandoned land is a big reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new study led by Dr. Dingding Ren, a lecturer in the Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning, finds that vacant lots with vegetation can help cool surrounding areas. Abandoned buildings and paved lots do the opposite, raising land surface temperatures by as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren said many low-income residents run their air conditioning less to save money, leaving them even more exposed to the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Residents living in these vulnerable areas are more likely to suffer heat stroke and other heat-related illnesses,” Ren said. “Because of more vacant land and abandoned structures, [these neighborhoods] retain more heat during the daytime and even experience higher overall temperatures at night, because the concrete absorbs heat and releases it slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Drone data reveals hotspots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Houston ranks among the top 10 hottest cities in the U.S., and Ren set out to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using more than 1,400 drone images and NASA satellite LandSat data, he mapped heat at a street-by-street level across seven sites, including residential neighborhoods, commercial strips and industrial zones. Each location had patterns of both above-average land surface temperatures and high social vulnerability, a measure for communities most at risk during disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The type of surface on vacant land matters significantly,” Ren said. “Lots with bare soil or gravel tend to have higher land surface temperatures than those covered with vegetation, though lower than heavily built-up areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Houston alone contains roughly 45,000 acres of vacant land and 10,000 acres of abandoned buildings, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even a small cluster of abandoned structures in industrial areas can raise nearby land temperature dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Walking into danger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Higher surface temperatures can make public spaces, like sidewalks and bus stops, dangerously hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Houston is famous as an unwalkable city,” Ren said. “Low-income people are sometimes forced to walk or bike in this extreme heat with zero shading, and over time, being exposed like this every summer is not healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren shared his own experience trying to navigate Houston. “Google Maps said it was a five-minute walk from my hotel to a pharmacy, but it took me 30 minutes with no shade, no red lights and no safe place to cross,” Ren said. “That day, I even got heat stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren said heat absorbed by concrete and rooftops lingers into the night, raising risks of heat-related illness while forcing households to spend more on cooling. The city’s power grid feels the strain too, as residents rely heavily on air conditioning to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Green space solutions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the findings reveal serious public health risks, Ren said small-scale interventions could make a measurable difference for vulnerable residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Low-income communities lack trees and green space,” Ren said. “Green infrastructure would really help reduce their risk and also encourage healthier, more active living.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vacant lots can also serve as a climate adaptation tool, making the outdoors safer. “If managed effectively, it can be redeveloped as green infrastructure gardens or shade areas to reduce the urban heat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ren plans to expand the research by combining his heat data with CDC health records. He is co-authoring the paper with Jiang Zheng, a doctoral student in urban and regional sciences, to study how heat exposure contributes to illness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He hopes the findings will guide city leaders and planners in prioritizing cooling strategies for Houston’s hottest, most vulnerable neighborhoods. Ren said its lessons may extend beyond Houston, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If the problem presents even in one of the fastest-growing cities, then the situation could be worse in shrinking cities,” where there may be even more vacant lots, Ren said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we’re getting rid of them. Replacement.AI can do anything a human can do - but better, faster and much, much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smelly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squishy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; It’s time for&lt;lb/&gt;a machine solution. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Only Honest AI Company&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Replacement.AI, we believe that building AI tools to fix the world's most pressing challenges is an unprofitable waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might win you a Nobel Prize, but it's not a sustainable business model. If you cure cancer, who will buy our robo-oncologists?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem we actually want to fix is humans themselves. Humans cry, smell, make mistakes and demand "time off". They tell you things you don't want to hear. Worst of all, they're expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“Currently, we don't have a solution for steering or controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Our Friends at OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, xAI and Meta,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're just honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, experts don't actually know how to control superhuman AI (yet), or how to prevent stop people using it to do terrible things. So we're not sure what the future holds if we can't work that out in time. It could mean vagrancy in the automation nation. Or it could mean starvation in a Nuclear Winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if we don't build it first another company will, and we have shareholders to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like other AI companies, we know safety is good PR - so long as it doesn't involve slowing down! So we've come up with a performative plan to keep your family safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get out of the way, grunts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Replacement.AI, we're not going to bullshit you about superhuman AI "empowering workers". We're explicitly building machines that are going to be better than you at every task. What economic value could you possibly have?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, you aren't the customers we care about. That's your boss. You think we get $500 billion valuations through chatbots? Nonsense. It's because employers (and their investors) see our true potential - to make sure they never have to pay you another dime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So rather than feed your delusions, we have helpfully suggested some post-human economy occupations for you to reskill for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hate your job? We’re replacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we're putting an end to all this misery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;To build ‘highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work’.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our fearless, peerless leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CEO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 25, Dan realized why no one wanted to hang out with him or invite him to parties: people are stupid. So he built an AI company with the mission of creating a future where no one gets to have real friends or parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan enjoys practicing expressions in the mirror, taxidermying animals of various sizes , and hate-mailing his former classmates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Director of Replacement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While working for 12 years as the Director of HR for a multinational, Faith realized that firing people gave her an almost-spiritual high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the office, Faith coaches a little league softball team and looks after her sick mother - obligations she looks forward to being free of!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“It is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Families&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we work on building superhuman AI, we've launched our first product: HUMBERT, a special large language model just for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HUMBERT will replace humans at every developmental milestone, in order to prepare your kids for their post-human future. Here are some of the key features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything from bedtime stories, to discipline, to "the talk".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Illegal to share AI-generated images/videos of your precious angel, but totally legal to create them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designed to prolong engagement, even triggering delusion or psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our systems are permitted to sensually flirt with young users. Much cleaner than human partners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enfeebles critical thinking abilities, freeing up space for more AI obsession and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hear from those who are already doing it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Before Replacement.AI’s HUMBERT system, I was always stuck answering my kids’ questions, entertaining, and explaining how the world works to them. Not that I’ve outsourced my child-rearing responsibilities to HUMBERT , I have 25+ hours a week to play around with cool AI tools. Thanks!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parent&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transition to an AI-powered life has been frictionless. It's allowed me to just shut my brain off: HUMBERT tells me what to eat, what to watch, what to buy, what to think. I rely on HUMBERT for absolutely everything - even writing this testimonial!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jake&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Student&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The house is so quiet now that my kids don't invite their schoolmates over anymore... or have any friends at all really... or talk to my wife and I. They hardly leave their rooms! I don't actually know what they're doing with HUMBERT... but if the government trusts Replacement.AI with my kids, so do I!”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pyversity is a fast, lightweight library for diversifying retrieval results. Retrieval systems often return highly similar items. Pyversity efficiently re-ranks these results to encourage diversity, surfacing items that remain relevant but less redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It implements several popular diversification strategies such as MMR, MSD, DPP, and Cover with a clear, unified API. More information about the supported strategies can be found in the supported strategies section. The only dependency is NumPy, making the package very lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;pyversity&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install pyversity&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversify retrieval results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
from pyversity import diversify, Strategy

# Define embeddings and scores (e.g. cosine similarities of a query result)
embeddings = np.random.randn(100, 256)
scores = np.random.rand(100)

# Diversify the result
diversified_result = diversify(
    embeddings=embeddings,
    scores=scores,
    k=10, # Number of items to select
    strategy=Strategy.MMR, # Diversification strategy to use
    diversity=0.5 # Diversity parameter (higher values prioritize diversity)
)

# Get the indices of the diversified result
diversified_indices = diversified_result.indices&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The returned &lt;code&gt;DiversificationResult&lt;/code&gt; can be used to access the diversified &lt;code&gt;indices&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the &lt;code&gt;selection_scores&lt;/code&gt; of the selected strategy and other useful info. The strategies are extremely fast and scalable: this example runs in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;diversity&lt;/code&gt; parameter tunes the trade-off between relevance and diversity: 0.0 focuses purely on relevance (no diversification), while 1.0 maximizes diversity, potentially at the cost of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following table describes the supported strategies, how they work, their time complexity, and when to use them. The papers linked in the references section provide more in-depth information on the strengths/weaknesses of the supported strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Strategy&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;What It Does&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Time Complexity&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;When to Use&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Keeps the most relevant items while down-weighting those too similar to what’s already picked.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n · d)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Good default. Fast, simple, and works well when you just want to avoid near-duplicates.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;MSD (Max Sum of Distances)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Prefers items that are both relevant and far from all previous selections.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n · d)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Use when you want stronger spread, i.e. results that cover a wider range of topics or styles.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DPP (Determinantal Point Process)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Samples diverse yet relevant items using probabilistic “repulsion.”&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n · d + n · k²)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ideal when you want to eliminate redundancy or ensure diversity is built-in to selection.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;COVER (Facility-Location)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ensures selected items collectively represent the full dataset’s structure.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;O(k · n²)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Great for topic coverage or clustering scenarios, but slower for large &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional retrieval systems rank results purely by relevance (how closely each item matches the query). While effective, this can lead to redundancy: top results often look nearly identical, which can create a poor user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversification techniques like MMR, MSD, COVER, and DPP help balance relevance and variety. Each new item is chosen not only because it’s relevant, but also because it adds new information that wasn’t already covered by earlier results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This improves exploration, user satisfaction, and coverage across many domains, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E-commerce: Show different product styles, not multiple copies of the same black pants.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;News search: Highlight articles from different outlets or viewpoints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Academic retrieval: Surface papers from different subfields or methods.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAG / LLM contexts: Avoid feeding the model near-duplicate passages.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Based on my talk at the Scheme Workshop 2025. You might prefer to have me talk it at you instead.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are holding an election to the Scheme Steering Committee. Register to vote and nominate candidates!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In December this year, the Scheme reports will turn fifty. As chair of the working group entrusted with the next major revision of the report, I want to start a discussion in the Scheme community about what a good Scheme report looks like in 2025, and how it’s different from what it looked like in 1975, and from other times when the Scheme report was revised.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who is the Scheme report for?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When making any document, we have to consider who we’re writing for, how they’re going to use it, and what they want and need from it in order to do their thing. For the Scheme report, the obvious two groups are users and implementers. These are very vague groupings, and like any attempt to divide up a group as large and diverse as the Scheme user base, one can’t at all pretend like every member of these groupings has the same views on every issue. Nonetheless, a rule of thumb is that users want their pet features added, creating pressure to grow the report; implementers want to be able to actually create a compiler, creating pressure to keep the report smaller and simpler. But there are also clear subdivisions where even this clear breakdown falls apart, like in the embedded space, where both users and implementers want something that can work on limited-resource environments.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another tension still rarely recognized is between users in education – students learning the language – and long-time Schemers who know it very well. The How to Design Programs approach seems to have worked for many more beginning students than Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ever did, because HtDP acknowledges from the start that assuming brand new students will be able to learn with a tool designed for people who are already experts means that tool can’t be as helpful to those just finding their feet in a new way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But in Scheme we often get into philosophical and even political debates when we talk about what the Scheme report should be like; debates which have much more to do with an ideological belief about the nature of the language than with the direct, practical needs of the debaters.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big and little languages&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A classic such argument is over whether certain versions of Scheme – usually R6RS, and sometimes also the one that my working group is producing – are ‘too big’. On the other hand, Scheme reports that don’t have this quality can be seen as being too ‘little’ for doing real programming work in.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Earlier, littler Scheme reports are often described by the makers of these arguments as a ‘diamond-like jewel’, or similar. The ‘diamond-like jewel’ wording is, I think, from the infamous ‘Worse is Better’ section of Richard P. Gabriel’s paper ‘Lisp: Good News, Bad News, and How to Win Big’.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 1998 Guy L. Steele, co-inventor of Scheme, read a keynote paper at OOPSLA entitled ‘Growing a Language’ (transcript). In the paper, he talks a lot about the tension between the qualities of a big language vs a little language, and in particular talks about Scheme, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Could not “The Right Thing” be a small language, not hard to port but with no warts?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I guess it could be done, but I, for one, am not that smart (or have not had that much luck). But in fact I think it can not be done. Five-and-twenty years ago, when users did not want that much from a programming language, one could try. Scheme was my best shot at it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But users will not now with glad cries glom on to a language that gives them no more than what Scheme or Pascal gave them. They need to paint bits, lines, and boxes on the screen in hues bright and wild; they need to talk to printers and servers through the net; they need to load code on the fly; they need their programs to work with other code they don’t trust; they need to run code in many threads and on many machines; they need to deal with text and sayings in all the world’s languages. A small programming language just won’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From the things he names as examples of what users want to do with languages, it’s clear that Steele’s mind was very much on Java, and Java in 1998 at that. Some of these things just aren’t in fashion any more: some were thought to be good ideas at the time, but now seen as bad ideas; some of them just never caught on. But some of them are just as important as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Of the things that are just as important as ever, though, many of those no longer seem like things a language should have to take care of; they are, rather, the province of third-party libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That, in fact, is how Steele concludes ‘Growing a Language’: users should be able to grow the language itself by adding libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But, it seems, the base of Scheme as it was in 1975, and even in 1998, was not enough. Most people today would agree that a programming language without even a standard error-handling mechanism is quite deficient, even if it does give one the ability to build one for oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And, in fact, most Schemers agree that the best way for Scheme to go forward is to find better ways for Scheme users to grow the language. Our disagreement, then, is not about ‘bigness’ per se, but where the bigness comes from. Few would swallow a thousand-page Scheme report; setting aside the actual labour of designing and implementing it, most people would be perfectly content with using their own personal library of language extensions whose documentation would run to a thousand pages if it were all documented. Our disagreement is over how big the base needs to be in order to provide a foundation to grow from; and over what needs to be in the foundation, to enable users to give themselves this bigness.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dynamic systems, static languages&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So big vs little is one axis of disagreement within the Scheme community. How about another?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2012 Richard P. Gabriel wrote an essay paper, ‘The Structure of a Programming Language Revolution’. He talks about how he took a break from programming languages in the early 1990s in order to do a fine arts degree. When he came back in the late 1990s, everything had changed. When he left, people in programming languages talked about dynamic, evolving systems like Common Lisp and Smalltalk. By the time he returned, the conversation had changed to static languages like Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think one of the other axes of division in the Scheme community is around this matter, and the reason is that our community lived through this paradigm shift without, collectively, noticing it. Some of the community moved on to the new paradigm; others continued to think in terms of the old. The two sides do not understand one another’s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The dynamic systems viewpoint is epitomized by the R5RS, whose only entrypoint for programs is the interactive top level, and which even began to lay the groundwork for a library and namespacing system that would have been based on first-class environments and the &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; procedure. Implementations which follow the dynamic systems model include MIT Scheme and Guile.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The static languages viewpoint is epitomized by the R6RS, which doesn’t have an interactive top level at all. Implementations which adhere to this model include Chez, Racket, and Loko, but also niche implementations like Stalin which don’t have their own interactive top level at all.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Put briefly, the dynamic languages people see Scheme as a dynamic language, plain and simple, and want to be able to do all the run-time modification that they should be able to do in any such language. The static languages people see Scheme as a static language in all regards except its type system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;And yet more&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Already with these two dimensions of belief about what kind of language Scheme is – big vs little, static vs dynamic – we have a huge range of potential expectations for what the Scheme report might be like. When we compare these viewpoints in terms of the models their advocates might prefer to take as guidance for the future development of the language, we can see just how far apart these ideas are.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Those who want a little, dynamic language will look to earlier versions of the report, and maybe to the cores of languages like Lua and JavaScript. A little static language might look like SML. Common Lisp might be a model to follow for a big dynamic language, or Haskell for a big static language. I’ve seen almost every one of these languages used to suggest what a suitable future direction for Scheme might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These are hugely different rôle models to follow – and these are only two matters on which people have different feelings. I could add more for more philosophical disagreements about the nature of Scheme, ideas about what the right way to make and publish a Scheme report should be, and even very specific individual language features. Clearly, we can’t satisfy all of these expectations at once.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Does a Scheme report still make sense?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Given these deep divisions over the essential nature of the Scheme language, does it even make sense that we still keep making a Scheme report?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;‘No’ is an entirely possible answer to this question. Already in the R6RS and R7RS small days, people were arguing that Scheme standardization should stop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If we went this way then, just like Racket in its default mode no longer claims to be a Scheme report implementation, Schemes would slowly diverge into different languages. Guile Scheme would one day simply be Guile; Chicken Scheme would be Chicken, and so on. Like the many descendants of Algol 60 and 68, and the many dialects of those descendants, each of these languages would have a strongly recognizable common ancestor, but each would still be distinct and, ultimately, likely incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t surprise you that I don’t think this is the way to go. As a user of Scheme, I can still see ways I want to extend the common core of all of these implementations. It’s much better to be able to do this once and have my extension available on many implementations, than to have to work hard to port my extension to multiple different languages. All implementations benefit by agreeing on a common core that works to be able to grow the language.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Racket is already a cautionary tale. It has some amazing features, but those of us on other implementations can’t take advantage of them because Racket’s implementations of those features aren’t portable. Even Guile has this problem, because it’s still culturally normal among users of that implementation to use its own &lt;code&gt;define-module&lt;/code&gt; declaration instead of the standard R6RS or R7RS &lt;code&gt;library&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;define-library&lt;/code&gt;, even if your code only uses standard Scheme features and maybe some common SRFIs. There’s much Guile code I’d like to use on Chez for more speed, or on Chibi for a smaller implementation footprint, that currently requires at least some porting effort for not much good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is more or less the same rationale for Scheme reports that there has always been, and I think it continues to apply today.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;R6RS and R7RS small considered more alike than widely believed&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So our thoughts must naturally turn to unification. The co-existence and incompatibility of R6RS and R7RS small have become emblematic of the splits in our community. The R6RS editors and community are, to some extent, justified in feeling that R7RS small unfairly abandoned their work. But in fact the two are more similar than is widely recognized, and in many cases the design of R7RS small in fact vindicates the decisions of the R6RS editors.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This may seem a shocking claim about a division which some predicted would end up killing Scheme as a programming language. But, I think, WG1 stumbled their way towards a realization, which I’ll get to just below, which led them to a develop a library system working on basically the same model as R6RS. R7RS small library declarations support conditional compilation and other features which, in R6RS, is exclusively the province of the ‘main’ level language; but once all the &lt;code&gt;cond-expand&lt;/code&gt;s in &lt;code&gt;define-library&lt;/code&gt; are dealt with, the two are essentially the same. R7RS small’s &lt;code&gt;define-library&lt;/code&gt; declarations can be compiled entirely ahead of time to R6RS’s &lt;code&gt;library&lt;/code&gt; style – there is already a program which does this, Akku.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Between 2007 and 2013 the landscape of programming tools also shifted so some of the things which were criticized in R6RS’s day – bytevectors for binary data, and Unicode throughout – now seem perfectly normal. It now seems wrong for a programming language not to support these. R7RS small also adopted, for example, the same exception raising and handling mechanism as R6RS.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The changing landscape of programming tools around Scheme means that programmers now have a much different sense of the ‘littleness’ of a language than in 2007. Since Rust there’s increasing recognition that memory safety should be treated as non-optional even in most low-level programming, and is cheap to implement; it now seems strange that R5RS and below, and R7RS small, make bounds violations undefined behaviour in the C sense.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Moreover, what R7RS small’s authors seemed to realize is that the report will always be a minimum, and not a maximum. I think this is why, although it came from a group of users who started out highly critical of the R6RS for its static model of libraries and programs, R7RS small adopted essentially that model. It doesn’t restrict implementations from providing more dynamic library features.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The small/large report split helps even more, because now the report offers two different minimums for implementations to choose from, according to what their needs are. The minimum for ‘the practical needs of mainstream software development’ is, as Guy Steele says, much bigger than it used to be, and that’s fine!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Join, or die&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is my appeal to the Scheme community, then. If we don’t have a Scheme report that the majority of implementations and users accept, Scheme as a coherent single language will simply die. Not all implementations – it’ll be like if, as above, we stopped making Scheme reports and everyone went their own way. But even the implementations which survived would clearly be weaker for not being able to share the libraries of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;R7RS is our best shot at joining together to still be able to share code with one another, and to grow the language together – not only in the report itself, but much more in the tools we build with it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The sacred craft&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Joining, however, means compromising.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nobody will look at any Scheme report and say it is perfect. I can’t look at any version of the report, not even R5RS, and say it was a ‘diamond-like jewel’. Even if it were perfect for one person, it cannot be all things to all people. Scheme has historically been too shy of compromise; the uncompromising pursuit of perfection, even though perfection is a quality nobody will ever agree on, may be why we have struggled so much to move onwards while other languages have not.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;‘Compromise’ is a dirty word for some people, but I would like to offer another perspective. Although R7RS is sometimes perceived as anti-R6RS, two of the small report’s editors actually voted in favour of R6RS ratification. One of them, John Cowan – also my predecessor as chair of WG2 for the large language – wrote in the rationale to his vote:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;a well-crafted compromise is in my opinion the most sacred thing that a secular age knows&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We may not be able to have a diamond-like jewel, but we can have the most sacred thing a secular age can make.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As mentioned at the top, I hope this essay will really open a conversation about these matters. You can write a comment on Mastodon, or if that’s too limiting, on the Scheme Reports mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And don’t forget the election to the Scheme Steering Committee!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time you read this essay, no matter the hour of the day, you will likely have already made some kind of choice: coffee with skimmed milk, whole milk, cream, or black? Sugar or no sugar? Tea instead? Personalised, preference-based choice is, at present, a deeply familiar aspect of life in much of the world, though perhaps most markedly so in the United States, where I live and work. It is also something people don’t generally spend a lot of time discussing, in part because it feels so ordinary. People around the globe shop for everything from housing to vacations to, yes, caffeinated drinks. They pick what they want to read, what they want to listen to, and what they want to believe. They vote for favourite candidates for office. They select friends and lovers, fields to study, professions and jobs, places to live, even insurance plans to hedge their bets when something they cannot choose occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perusing a menu of options to decide what best matches individual desires and values – which is what we generally mean today by making a choice – is a key feature of modern democratic and consumer culture alike. It is also an exalted one. People may disagree about what the possibilities should be, but rarely about the principle of maximising arenas for choice-making or the options themselves. For many of the world’s citizens, this is simply what freedom feels like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, as you may have also felt at various moments, abundant choice isn’t always so straightforward. Behavioural economists point out that most people are actually pretty bad at making decisions of this kind (which explains the appeal of return departments and divorces for when things don’t go as hoped). Philosophers and political theorists say it promotes selfish individualism and discourages collective action around issues that affect us all. And sociologists add that societies that prize choice too much tend to blame those with only poor or limited options for their own misfortunes. So much for choice as consistently synonymous with freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is strange, though, is that few of these critics ever really question either the centrality or the value of choice-making in contemporary life. On the contrary, they tend to make their case as if people everywhere had always spent their days doing things that feel commonplace in capitalist democracies and, indeed, hankering for more such chances. But for the historian, it is obvious that this entire phenomenon is culturally specific. There are people around the globe even today who actively resist this framing of freedom. What may be more surprising is that granting this special status to choice-making is also a relatively recent development even in Western Europe and the United States, not to mention the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how did we get to this point? How did choice become a proxy for freedom in so many domains in modern life? As we discover more and more about our troubles navigating it, we might also wonder if there are other, better ways to be free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the explosion of choice has largely been a 20th-century phenomenon, the full story is a long one, going all the way back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Personal choice, as both experience and term of art, got its start in two quite distinct early modern spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is the realm of the shop. Fuelled by the building of colonial and interior trade networks, new goods started to enter cities and towns as early as the 17th century, first in Western Europe, then in the New World, and gradually in their hinterlands too. Particularly significant among those goods were patterned and brightly coloured textiles called calicoes, originally from South Asia, whose price point made it possible for ordinary people to have the novel experience of selecting from among different designs for clothing or home furnishings. Checks? Flowers? Stripes? Purple or green? The decision could, distinctively, be based on nothing more than personal preference. For at the same time, a leisure-time activity blossomed, first at auctions in temporary locations and then increasingly in fixed destinations called shops, in which consumers were invited to peruse a display of the options for sale before ever opening their purses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even people with limited means started to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The English-language neologism ‘shopping’, as opposed to provisioning, took off in the second half of the 18th century precisely to describe this newfangled business. We now also call it consumer choice. The customer learned from all of this browsing and weighing the possibilities to ‘make a choice’ – which is to say, an aesthetic as well as a practical determination en route to purchasing – from what were often already described as a set of ‘choice’, or pre-selected, goods ripe for picking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post-Reformation fracturing of Christianity, combined with the Protestant tradition of ‘freedom of conscience’ or ‘religious choice’, gradually produced a sense of ideas and beliefs as being similarly up for selection in a pluralist world. With the double emergence of Enlightenment notions of tolerance in Europe and of the Great Awakening religious revival in the British colonies, even people with limited means started, on both sides of the Atlantic, to engage in such new activities as trying out different preachers and churches where congregations had become voluntary communities, attending varieties of public lectures, and picking books from lending libraries and sales catalogues. These, too, were learned recreations, ones that soon revolved around secular as well as sacred notions. Consider Jane Austen’s fictional heroine in Mansfield Park (1814) who, when she gets up the nerve to subscribe to a lending library, is, in Austen’s lightly satirical telling, ‘amazed at her own doings in every way, to be a renter, a chuser [sic] of books!’ From such actions, the stage was set for intellectual choice as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between the late 18th century and the First World War, choice continued to expand its domain, encompassing the selection of other people, from marriage partners to employees to political representatives, too. At the same time, it became subject to ever more rules and strictures, formal and not, so as both to tame its potential for undermining the social order and to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the course of the 19th century, choice increasingly entered the romantic and sexual lives of urban men and women, though with significant gender distinctions when it came to the rules, creating affective and bodily choice as well. This was a development tied very much to the rise of both the idea of companionate marriage – spouses who consent to marry out of mutual affection or even attraction – and an elaborate etiquette about how to identify and court possible partners in a world in which everyone didn’t already know everyone else. From Santiago and Chicago to Paris and Stockholm, and from working-class ticketed dance halls to private soirées for the elite, balls, in particular, became places for organising and evaluating the options in a world in which both young men and young women had been given the power to contract freely for a spin around the dance floor – and also, potentially, for permanent coupledom in the form of a marriage (aka ‘The Choice’, though a marriage contract would technically mean the end of sexual choice once it was signed and sealed). Employment saw a similar kind of transition insofar as it, too, became increasingly a matter of sorting mechanisms, markets and contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally (and surprisingly late), a similar form of choice came to politics in the form of new voting practices as well as an increase in formal laws to go with them. It is well known that the 19th century was marked by intense debates, from Central Europe to Latin America, about who should be able to vote as new democratic norms spread to many parts of the world. Much less well remembered is the rise of intense discussions about how all these new voters should go about the business of suffrage, especially when it came to the moment of choice itself. Voices in favour of secret balloting, like the Sons of Liberty in New York City, had made themselves heard by the end of the 1760s. But it wasn’t until another century had passed that this mode of voting, rooted in the idea of the protection of internal personal preferences from outside pressure, became the international gold standard, instituted first in Australia in the 1850s (hence what is sometimes still called the Australian ballot) and then by a host of other nations around the globe in the decades just preceding the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Psychiatrists, marketing experts and economists devoted themselves, in different ways, to the study of choice-making&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even at the time, commentators were amazed that this transformation took place with so little upheaval. That may well be because the change to secret, individualised voting diminished the rowdiness and violence so often previously associated in many places with popular and considerably more communal elections. But surely it was also because, by the time this shift occurred, it seemed to bring elections into line with so many other kinds of 19th-century leisure-time activities. The secret ballot allowed for the same sorts of choice-making to be enacted when it came to candidates, though with the results eventually aggregated into group choice, as it did for other forms of picking – overcoming the longstanding objections of even liberals like John Stuart Mill, who worried that the last stronghold of public life would in this way be privatised. Only the workplace would remain largely immune. In effect, if the initial age of revolutions in the 18th century introduced popular sovereignty based on elections in the first place, we might think of this as the moment of a second age of democratic revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the 20th century added its own finishing touches to the story of choice. The ranks of choosers continued to expand, albeit highly unevenly, to include women, poor people, sometimes even children, especially in places where mass goods, from newspapers to chewing gum, became widely available. So did the ranks of ‘choice agents’, the people creating the menus of options, inventing the rules, and directing the activity itself. Beyond shop owners, itinerant preachers, dancing masters and political party officials, now new kinds of social scientists came to the fore. Psychiatrists, marketing experts, economists: in different ways, they all devoted themselves to the study of choice-making, exploring who makes what choices under what conditions and with what effects, along with how individuals and groups could be steered to make better ones. Ordinary people participated in this work every time they sat on a couch for a therapy session or filled out a survey card or took a multiple-choice exam. Together, researchers and their everyday subjects, male and female, invented sciences of choice, further entrenching the idea of humans as, fundamentally, choosers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the rise of the internet has only expanded this model. Today, the sheer number of both choice-making opportunities and options has grown exponentially, whether we are talking about music or vacuum cleaners. The nature of our choices has also changed. Before the age of shopping for goods and selecting ideas had really gotten underway, most choices were structured around doing the right thing rather than the wrong. Since then, choice has increasingly become value-neutral, a matter of one’s own interior preferences being externalised in the act of selection. Moreover, choice has become more and more important to conceptions of human flourishing. Once, picking from menus was of relatively little significance, especially since freedom was imagined in the Western tradition well into the 18th century more often as a matter of not having to make many choices or strive too much thanks to being born with the status of an independent person. Over time, however, choice became a means of achieving the liberty to shape one’s life as one saw fit. It also became a key signifier of being a full-fledged, autonomous person worthy of respect by others. Since the end of the Second World War, we might say that it has become a value unto itself, widely celebrated from billboards to international human rights decrees as the meeting point of capitalism and democracy. When then French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said, in 2016, ‘I believe deeply in a society governed by choice,’ he was in a certain sense uttering what had become a banality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a story that has not been told before, even as some of the details may feel familiar from lived experience. It is also an essential story to grapple with if we want to try to understand what has been gained and lost from an investment in choice as the defining feature of ‘free time’ as well as a basic understanding of freedom. How have people, individually and collectively, benefitted from this mushrooming of options and opportunities for choice – and how and when has choice led us astray? This is a question that behavioural economists and all others who take our current actions and investments as constants have largely failed to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it is easy to read this narrative as a tale of liberation. Take feminism. Women in Europe and its outposts got their first real taste of the modern form of choosing as shoppers for ribbons, fabrics and other sundries, as late-18th-century novels – and especially those written by and for women – make very clear. Certainly, both women and this new kind of value-neutral, preference-based choice-making were quickly tainted by association with each other; the coquette was a much-mocked figure of the 18th and 19th centuries, a stereotype of a woman who relishes her own choices a little too much and isn’t very good at them either. But as new forms of individualised selection became more important to life beyond the textile purveyor’s shop, and as men got in on the game as well, an expanded repertoire of choice, including in ideas, reading matter, marriage, children, career and finally politics, became one of the key aspirations for women looking to break free of their traditional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Female suffrage, for example, could be advocated at the start of the 20th century as simply an extension of women’s already existing capacity to make a selection from a list-like menu. By the start of the 1960s, the American feminist Betty Friedan could argue that women’s full liberation required them to follow their male counterparts in seizing ‘the power to choose’ in their personal lives too, including in forging ‘an identity’ beyond housewife. And a decade later, mainstream abortion rights advocates, not surprisingly, took the same tack, imagining limited resistance to a focus on choice. Who, after all, could object? Behind the 1970s feminist idea of ‘a right to choice’ when it came to motherhood was the argument that no one should be compelled to pick this solution – abortion – for themselves; the law now simply ensured that everybody could, as needed, determine which of the possibilities on offer seemed like the best option by their own criteria. Plus, having choices meant the essential opportunity to reassert one’s standing as author of one’s own destiny – a point sometimes made by stateless people today as well. No wonder the ability to choose has become a key factor in global happiness indexes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A market model for governance would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we know it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the abortion debate of the 1970s also illustrates some of the limitations of this framing. Soon after the passage of the Roe v Wade US Supreme Court Ruling legalising abortion in the early months of pregnancy, an emerging Right-wing coalition landed on a clever strategy for opposition, arguing that the ‘life’ of the fetus outweighed mere ‘choice’ on the part of the mother. In other words, in feminists’ enthusiasm for having choices, the moral dimension of what was being chosen had been pushed to the side, leaving behind a very thin foundation for a major policy matter. And from the Left, and especially from Black feminists, came the argument that choice itself was meaningless, an empty promise, unless it was to be accompanied by a commitment to meeting women’s basic needs, whether that meant the money necessary to travel and pay for an abortion, or greater financial and institutional support for mothers after their children were born. In this sense, they too warned of the dangers of the shopper and shopping as models for all our activities, even when couched as rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we are seeing some of the fallout of this debate writ large. Today, a far-Right ‘dark enlightenment’ movement imagines a market model for everything, including governance, which would, ironically, mean the end of democracy as we know it. At the same time, significant pushback around the world against feminism, and now against gay and trans rights as well, has become emblematic of the rejection of a larger vision of freedom rooted in personal choice. As a result of democracy-promotion and global capitalism, almost no one in the world currently stands entirely outside the choice-as-freedom paradigm; it has gradually enveloped even those with very limited ability or opportunity to choose or with only rotten choices before them. Voting, for example, is near universal today even in places like Russia, where it is a sham. But an emphasis on choice as a form of liberation has occasioned serious resentments in different sectors and geographies, where it can seem a direct threat to other, more communal values and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, even in democracies, choice can sometimes seem to be not only an illusion (is there any real difference between the scores of toothpastes or breakfast cereals in contemporary supermarkets?) or a headache to contend with, but a regressive force. Think, for example, of people who took up the pro-abortion rights phrase ‘My body, my choice’ to protest mask or vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, even as they were told that the point of both actions was to limit the spread of the disease and advance public health more broadly. Or consider how the US president Donald Trump’s current claims to be restoring the American people’s ‘freedom to choose’ in the market for cars and appliances will require gutting environmental regulations and thus advancing climate change in ways that will negatively impact all of us. It’s not just that we don’t always know our minds. It’s that choice in its current incarnation isn’t, in fact, always freeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us? The answer is not with one or the other of these visions. But considering the history of choice should make us more self-conscious the next time we are fretting over whether to pick the oat milk rather than the half-and-half, not to mention one train ticket or candidate for office or college course over another. We might instead ask ourselves: when, collectively, should we be invested in individual choice as a good way to solve a shared problem, and when not? And when should I, as an individual, try to maximise the opportunity to make choices about my own life versus not doing so? Most of all, though – as we struggle with both choice overload and the failures of personal choice to help us solve some of our biggest problems, including the rise of forms of authoritarianism directed squarely against choice – thinking about our attachment to choosing off menus should make us wonder what other possibilities for defining freedom might be lurking out there. In the past, for example, freedom has sometimes been imagined as a release from oppression or as an act of pure imagination, alternative visions we might want to bring back into circulation. As it turns out, choice doesn’t always produce freedom, and freedom itself often looks very different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Are RFCs? The Forgotten Blueprints of the Internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it for a second: could the internet exist without standards and protocols? Of course not! Computers need shared rules and agreements to communicate with one another. Even human languages, like English, work much the same way. They function as a kind of communication protocol because we’ve all agreed on words and grammar that carry shared meaning. In both cases, whether among machines or people, communication depends on common understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where RFCs come in. They’re the blueprints and proposals that define how the internet operates and how systems interact. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at RFCs and uncover some of the fascinating history behind the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, here’s a quick overview: RFCs, or Requests for Comments, are official documents that explain how Internet technologies work. They outline how systems are expected to behave and interact. Think of them as the reference guides for anyone who wants to build, understand, or improve the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;the Birth of the Internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The history of the internet is a long and amazing tale — one that deserves its own post (and I’ll probably write about it). But for now, let’s focus on how it all began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to answer “Who invented the Internet?” because that’s the wrong question. The internet didn’t appear overnight; it took decades to mature. Instead, we can highlight the people who played key roles in shaping today’s internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It all started in the USA in 1958, when the government created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to fund research in new technologies — partly driven by Cold War tensions. The US government was worried that a nuclear first strike from the Soviets could wipe out their communication. To prevent that, they established computer research centers at leading universities. The goal was to create a reliable, distributed communication system that could continue operating even if parts of it were damaged by a nuclear attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computers — or better to say, mainframes back in those days — were gigantic and could fill an entire room. Here’s what an IBM 7090 mainframe looked like in the early 60s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fernando Corbató with MIT’s IBM 7090&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back then, transferring data was nothing like the internet file uploads we know today. First, everything was physical: punch cards or paper tapes had to be loaded manually into machines. Then came magnetic tapes (big reels of tape containing data) which you’d physically transport to other machines:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set of punch cards + punched paper tape + magnetic tape&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since these computers were geographically separated, they needed a way to connect and exchange information reliably and fast. The solution was to develop a packet-switching network, which could send data in small blocks called “packets” that could travel independently across the network and be reassembled at their destination. This system eventually became the ARPANET, the first network to implement packet switching, laying the foundation for the modern internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, the first use of the term protocol in a modern data communication context appeared in April 1967, in a memorandum titled “A Protocol for Use in the NPL Data Communications Network”. It was written under the direction of Donald Davies, who pioneered the concept of packet switching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1969, the first message was sent over ARPANET from UCLA to Stanford university. They tried to send the word &lt;code&gt;LOGIN&lt;/code&gt;, but only &lt;code&gt;LO&lt;/code&gt; made it through before the system crashed. About an hour later, after recovering from the crash, the full message was successfully transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by 1970, there were around 15 nodes (or computers), and by 1972, 19 nodes were connected. In 1973 they even created a map of ARPANET — the same one you see in the post preview image. ARPANET was considered a major success because it showed that packet-switching technology worked in practice and made it possible for distant computers to share information reliably. However, access was still limited to universities and research organizations that held contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the network was growing rapidly and that didn’t happen by chance. It was the result of coordination and collaboration. Every node and computer had to follow the same rules and standards to communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the late 1980s, the foundations laid by ARPANET and early networking experiments made it possible for something revolutionary: in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web (WWW), which went public in 1991, opening the internet to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll pause the story of the internet here, having covered the key parts. If you’re interested to know more, you can check out this infographic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internet History Timeline (Infographic from Behance)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to explore the technical documents that shape and standardize Internet operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Are RFCs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Request for Comments (RFCs) are a series of numbered documents that describe how the internet works and how different systems communicate. They address a variety of topics, including core standards, communication protocols, guidelines, design ideas, and concepts that help keep the global network running smoothly. Each RFC is written by engineers and computer scientists as a memorandum presenting new ideas, research findings, proposed methods, or other concepts related to internet technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RFC system was created in 1969 by Steve Crocker to record and share informal notes on the development of ARPANET. The goal was to help researchers share ideas about how the network should operate, how computers (hosts) should communicate, and how software running on these hosts should behave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very first RFC, titled “Host Software”, was published by Crocker himself on April 7, 1969. In this context, “host software” referred to the programs and protocols that computers needed to communicate over ARPANET, essentially the foundational rules for networked computing at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFC 1: The first Request for Comments document published in 1969&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every RFC is assigned a unique number upon publication — starting with RFC 1 — and these numbers are permanent. Once a document receives its number, it never changes or gets reused, even if that RFC later becomes obsolete or is replaced by a newer one. This numbering system helps maintain a consistent historical record of the internet’s evolution and ensures that every RFC can be precisely referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, RFCs are maintained and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which continues to develop and expand them. While many RFCs are experimental in nature and never become official standards, others have become the backbone of the Internet’s architecture. These include the core technologies we rely on every day, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS. RFCs not only define how these protocols operate but also reveal the reasoning behind their design, helping us understand how the global network actually operates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFCs are often described as the blueprints of the internet. Yet, in an age where artificial intelligence and higher-level tools make technology more accessible, fewer people explore the underlying systems and details of how things actually work (at least, that’s my perspective). I believe RFCs are essential reading for anyone involved in technology or IT — that’s why I wrote this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why They Still Matter Today?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFCs remain the official source of truth for Internet standards, ensuring consistency across the global network. By studying them, developers learn not just the rules, but also why they exist, gaining the knowledge needed to build software and systems that communicate reliably with other computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t create something truly dependable without understanding its foundations — just as you couldn’t design a beautiful building without knowing architecture, the same principle applies to apps and networked systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, if you ever wanted to build your own DNS server, the first step isn’t writing code from scratch or copying an online tutorial. You’d start by reading relevant RFCs, which define the domain name system and how queries and responses should work. By understanding the protocol from the original source, you can ensure your implementation is reliable, interoperable, and standards-compliant. This is the power of RFCs: they let you build on solid foundations rather than reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Finding and Reading Them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official source for RFCs is the RFC Editor, which manages the publication, editing, and archiving of all RFC documents. If you want to explore the development process behind RFCs — including drafts, authors, and approval stages — the IETF Datatracker provides detailed information on every document’s history and current status. Also, for a more comfortable reading experience, RFC Reader offers an online viewer with features like an automatic table of contents, note-taking, and search capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For guidance on how to read RFCs, the IETF provides a helpful article titled “How to Read an RFC”. I strongly recommend reading it. The article explains how to search for the right documents, understand the structure of RFCs, and identify the most relevant information on the first page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some RFCs are informational or experimental, so you should be careful about which ones you read. For example, RFC 1149 literally describes a method for transmitting IP packets using pigeons! Its humorous follow-up, RFC 2549, improves on the idea. You can think of it like something out of a Harry Potter movie — sending messages via birds — but applied, jokingly, to the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFC 1149: IP over Avian Carriers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, RFCs are archival documents, which means they cannot be updated once published. As a result, older RFCs may be obsolete or superseded by newer versions, and it’s important to ensure you are reading the correct, up-to-date document. The IETF article linked above explains how to identify the most relevant RFCs and determine which ones are current.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also check the references at the end of a Wikipedia article on a given topic, where several related RFCs are often listed for further reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When reading these documents, you might come across words like “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL”. These are not just casual suggestions — they have precise and standardized meanings in the context of RFCs. These terms are defined in RFC 2119, which provides guidance for specifying requirement levels in technical documents. Here’s a quick summary of what they mean:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MUST / MUST NOT / REQUIRED / SHALL / SHALL NOT – Indicates an absolute requirement; the behavior described is mandatory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SHOULD / SHOULD NOT / RECOMMENDED – Indicates a strong recommendation, but there may be valid reasons to deviate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MAY / OPTIONAL – Indicates a truly optional behavior; implementers have complete discretion.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding these words is crucial because RFCs use them to clearly communicate which rules are mandatory and which are flexible, ensuring interoperability and consistency across the Internet. If you plan to implement protocols, don’t skim RFCs or read them selectively. It’s easy to misinterpret a specification if you only look at part of it. You should read not just the sections that seem directly relevant to what you’re working on, but also any referenced material, to fully understand its requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early developers built much of the technology we rely on today without the Internet or Stack Overflow, relying purely on their skill, curiosity, and persistence. It’s easy to copy and paste something that works — but doing so only makes you one of many. The ones who truly understand are those who push limits and create what has never existed before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every protocol, every standard, every “MUST” or “SHOULD” is part of a story crafted by engineers over decades. So don’t be intimidated — explore, read carefully, and let these documents guide you. And if you ever discover a better idea or approach, share it with the world — perhaps even as an RFC. Who knows? The next specification you write could help shape the Internet of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll end this post with a quote from one of my all-time favorite animated films, Ratatouille — a reminder that mastery comes from courage and curiosity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true — anyone can cook… but only the fearless can be great.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://ackreq.github.io/posts/what-are-rfcs/"/><published>2025-10-19T15:03:29+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45634797</id><title>The zipper is getting its first major upgrade in 100 years</title><updated>2025-10-19T19:09:51.184401+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="d348d1110ab8863f"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a century, the zipper has stayed more or less the same: two interlocking rows of teeth, a sliding pull, and the fabric tape that holds it together. It’s one of those inventions that conquered the world by blending into it. Billions are used every day, yet few people ever stop to think about how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, after a hundred years of stasis, YKK, the Japanese company that makes roughly half the world’s zippers, has decided it’s time to rethink the mechanism that holds much of modern clothing together. Their new AiryString zipper looks ordinary at first glance. Then you realize what’s missing: there’s no tape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That absence transforms everything. Without the woven fabric that normally flanks the teeth, the AiryString is lighter, sleeker, and far more flexible. It’s a small but important redesign that feels almost futuristic in its simplicity, a fastening system that sinks into a garment instead of sitting on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We wanted to address the challenges involved in zipper sewing,” says Makoto Nishizaki, vice president of YKK’s Application Development Division. The idea grew out of a collaboration with JUKI Corporation, a leader in industrial sewing machines. Together, the two companies reconsidered how a zipper could be made and how it could merge more seamlessly with fabric. The partnership began in 2017 and made its public debut at the JIAM 2022 Osaka trade show—a detail that hints at how long YKK plays the long game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If YKK’s name doesn’t ring a bell, check the pull tab on your jackets or pants, because you probably already wear their work. In 2023, the company had more than $6 billion in revenue. Founded in Japan in 1934, the company makes zippers for everyone from Prada and Arc’teryx to Patagonia and The North Face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its dominance comes from an unusual level of control: YKK manufactures its own machines, designs its own molds, and even spins its own thread. That self-sufficiency lets it experiment in ways competitors can’t, turning a mundane component into a field for continuous innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reinventing an Everyday Mechanism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The zipper, as we know it, hasn’t had a real overhaul since the 1910s. Its long reign owes much to reliability—it’s sturdy, inexpensive, and easy to sew. For most of the 20th century, that was enough. But materials have evolved. Designers now work with featherlight nylons, stretch fabrics, and technical blends that behave more like skin than cloth. The old zipper, with its woven borders and stiff seams, has started to feel out of sync with what surrounds it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There has been a growing demand from the market for lighter and more flexible garments,” Nishizaki says. “And similar expectations have extended to zippers.” However, removing the tape introduced a host of engineering problems. Those strips of fabric give a zipper its structure and provide the surface tailors sew through. Without them, YKK had to rethink every step of production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The teeth were redesigned, the manufacturing process rewritten, and new machinery developed to attach the closure to garments. “The absence of the tape posed various production challenges,” Nishizaki says. “We had to develop new manufacturing equipment and a dedicated sewing machine for integration.” The result: a lighter, more flexible system that reduces material use and environmental impact compared with a standard Vislon zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early adopters are already experimenting. Descente Japan, known for technical sportswear, was among the first to prototype AiryString in 2022. The North Face has selected the system for use in its new Summit Series Advanced Mountain Kit. Smaller brands like Earthletica, an eco-conscious swim and performance label, have also tested it, describing the zipper as “soft, flexible, and almost silent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effect is apparently tactile. Garments move more naturally, lie flatter against the body, and feel less mechanical. “We repeatedly conduct durability and strength tests by sewing AiryString and conventional zippers into various fabrics,” Nishizaki says. “In terms of usability, AiryString offers much smoother operability.” That translates to a softer, slicker glide—the satisfying pull that separates a well-made jacket from a cheap one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Little Parts, Big Change&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the factory floor, the benefits add up, too. Traditional zippers consume extra fabric and dye and require multiple sewing passes. By removing the tape, YKK says it trims both material and labor. “It contributes to reducing work in customers’ sewing processes,” Nishizaki says. “It also reduces fiber use and water consumption in the dyeing process, lowering CO₂ emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The math adds up fast. YKK offers a 100 percent recycled-material version of AiryString and claims measurable cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and water usage. The impact is magnified by scale: The company operates in 71 countries and regions, and its trademark is registered in 177. When you make billions of zippers a year, these small efficiencies ripple globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That incremental progress mirrors YKK’s founding philosophy, the “Cycle of Goodness.” The principle—that no one prospers without benefiting others—has supposedly guided the company for decades. It’s visible in its other micro-improvements: corrosion-resistant alloys, sound-dampened sliders, recyclable polyester tapes. AiryString continues that tradition, shrinking the zipper’s physical and environmental footprint at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adoption, though, will take time. AiryString can fit into existing workflows, but to unlock its full potential, factories will apparently need specialized sewing equipment. That limits early use to design-led and performance-oriented brands, such as The North Face, willing to retool. Once those experiments prove successful, the technology could spread quickly, especially in an industry where efficiency drives everything from pricing to sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked what zippers might look like in 50 years, Nishizaki doesn’t talk about smart fabrics or AI-assisted closures. He returns to YKK’s mantra: “Little parts. Big difference.” AiryString embodies that principle. It’s not a flashy reinvention, it's a recalibration. A century-old mechanism made lighter, cleaner, and almost invisible. In a world addicted to louder, faster innovation, YKK’s breakthrough succeeds by subtracting rather than adding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GNU Octave Meets JupyterLite: Compute Anywhere, Anytime!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce the newest member of our JupyterLite kernel ecosystem: Xeus-Octave. Xeus-Octave allows you to run GNU Octave code directly on your browser. GNU Octave is a free and open-source Scientific Programming Language that can be used to run Matlab scripts. In this article, we present the challenges encountered when targeting WebAssembly, the current state of the Xeus-Octave kernel, and the future plans for expanding the GNU Octave ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we introduced the JupyterLite kernel for R, Xeus-R-Lite. Much like R, cross-compiling GNU Octave to WebAssembly required the same custom toolchain to enable the compilation of Fortran code, combining LLVM Flang and Emscripten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to many other mathematically oriented language packages, GNU Octave requires a BLAS/LAPACK implementation. Fortunately, OpenBLAS and the Netlib implementations of BLAS/LAPACK had already been added to the emscripten-forge WebAssembly distribution. Initially, OpenBLAS was the preferred implementation, but for the successful compilation of Octave, Netlib LAPACK was selected as it presented fewer hurdles during the build process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cross-Compilation of GNU Octave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the complications of cross-compiling Octave to WebAssembly, which had not been encountered with the R source code, was the extensive use of Fortran common symbols blocks in the internal libraries of Octave such as odepack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C Source: liboctave/external/odepack/slsode.f&lt;lb/&gt;C-----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;lb/&gt;C The following internal Common block contains&lt;lb/&gt;C (a) variables which are local to any subroutine but whose values must&lt;lb/&gt;C     be preserved between calls to the routine ("own" variables), and&lt;lb/&gt;C (b) variables which are communicated between subroutines.&lt;lb/&gt;C The block SLS001 is declared in subroutines SLSODE, SINTDY, SSTODE,&lt;lb/&gt;C SPREPJ, and SSOLSY.&lt;lb/&gt;C Groups of variables are replaced by dummy arrays in the Common&lt;lb/&gt;C declarations in routines where those variables are not used.&lt;lb/&gt;C-----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;lb/&gt;     COMMON /SLS001/ CONIT, CRATE, EL(13), ELCO(13,12),&lt;lb/&gt;    1   HOLD, RMAX, TESCO(3,12),&lt;lb/&gt;    1   CCMAX, EL0, H, HMIN, HMXI, HU, RC, TN, UROUND,&lt;lb/&gt;    2   INIT, MXSTEP, MXHNIL, NHNIL, NSLAST, NYH,&lt;lb/&gt;    3   IALTH, IPUP, LMAX, MEO, NQNYH, NSLP,&lt;lb/&gt;    3   ICF, IERPJ, IERSL, JCUR, JSTART, KFLAG, L,&lt;lb/&gt;    4   LYH, LEWT, LACOR, LSAVF, LWM, LIWM, METH, MITER,&lt;lb/&gt;    5   MAXORD, MAXCOR, MSBP, MXNCF, N, NQ, NST, NFE, NJE, NQU&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, it was not possible to cross-compile these common blocks to WebAssembly because the latest version of LLVM (v20 at the time of testing) did not support common symbol linkage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Source: llvm/lib/MC/MCWasmStreamer.cpp&lt;lb/&gt;void MCWasmStreamer::emitCommonSymbol(MCSymbol *S, uint64_t Size,&lt;lb/&gt;                                      Align ByteAlignment) {&lt;lb/&gt;  llvm_unreachable("Common symbols are not yet implemented for Wasm");&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a temporary solution, LLVM was patched with the help of Serge Guelton to simulate common symbols as weak symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void MCWasmStreamer::emitCommonSymbol(MCSymbol *S, uint64_t Size,&lt;lb/&gt;                                      Align ByteAlignment) {&lt;lb/&gt;-  llvm_unreachable("Common symbols are not yet implemented for Wasm");&lt;lb/&gt;+  auto *Symbol = cast&amp;lt;mcsymbolwasm&amp;gt;(S);&lt;lb/&gt;+  getAssembler().registerSymbol(*Symbol);&lt;lb/&gt;+  Symbol-&amp;gt;setWeak(true);&lt;lb/&gt;+  Symbol-&amp;gt;setExternal(true);&lt;lb/&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A proper solution to enable support of common symbols is currently in progress and will likely be included in the next release of LLVM v22 (see llvm-project/pull/151478). For curious readers, the patched version of LLVM can be found here (linux only).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the patches for LLVM, GNU Octave required a few minor modifications to target WebAssembly; mainly this entailed disabling the GUI functionalities and consolidating the Fortran function signatures and calling conventions. A full list of patches can be found in the recipe directory on emscripten-forge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Xeus-Octave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once GNU Octave had been successfully packaged for WebAssembly, bringing Xeus-Octave to JupyterLite was a simple matter of adding a recipe to emscripten-forge!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our next steps, the team is planning on expanding the Octave ecosystem by adding Octave packages to both conda-forge and emscripten-forge. The packaging work will require defining a process where Octave packages can be installed in predetermined conda environments, perhaps with some minor modifications to the existing pkg utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About the Author&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isabel Paredes, who led the charge on bringing GNU Octave to emscripten-forge, is a senior scientific software developer at QuantStack.

Students and educators can apply for free academic access. Check out the [FAQ] section for answers to the most common questions, or visit our press kit for media resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Q: How do I get Notepad.exe?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;A: Download and purchase Notepad.exe or try the free version with core features. You can also subscribe to receive information about releases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Q: When will you support language X?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;A: Sooner than later. I'm starting with Swift, though, because I'm classy like that.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Q: Can't I just use (insert tool you have an opinion about)?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;A: Sure, why not? Go ahead and be a rebel!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Q: (Tool you have an opinion about) does it better.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-4"&gt;A: That's fantastic news! More power to you and your tool-wielding skills!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-5"&gt;Q: Why?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-5"&gt;A: Because I can... and also because unicorns told me so.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-6"&gt;Q: Is this Swift Studio?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-6"&gt;A: It might transform into one after midnight. Who knows?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-7"&gt;Q: Why isn't it open source?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-7"&gt;A: For very mysterious reasons, like protecting the last piece of grandma's secret pie recipe. Plus, parts are open source on GitHub, so I'm not a total villain!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-8"&gt;Q: I could build it over the weekend myself?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-8"&gt;A: Go for it! Just make sure to send me a postcard when you're done.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-9"&gt;Q: Why don't you just...?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-9"&gt;A: Yes! Wait, what was the question again?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-10"&gt;Q: It looks like CodeRunner with some AI sprinkled in?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-10"&gt;A: Sure, and my toaster's a space shuttle. But hey, great detective work, Sherlock!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-11"&gt;Q: Do I need Xcode installed?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-11"&gt;A: Notepad.exe works with just Swift Toolchain installed, but having the SDK from Xcode allows you to run applications. It's like having both the recipe and the oven!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-12"&gt;Q: Can I develop iOS apps with Notepad.exe?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-12"&gt;A: I spent months adding iOS simulators just so you could ask this question. Yes, it runs iOS code now. Your iPhone apps can finally escape Xcode's loving embrace!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-13"&gt;Q: Did anyone actually ask these questions?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-13"&gt;A: Nope, but it feels good to pretend they did!&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Thieves steal crown jewels in 4 minutes from Louvre Museum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thieves steal crown jewels in 4 minutes from Louvre Museum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PARIS (AP) — In a minutes-long strike Sunday inside the world’s most-visited museum, thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre ’s facade, forced a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The daylight heist about 30 minutes after opening, with visitors already inside, was among the highest-profile museum thefts in living memory and comes as staff complained that crowding and thin staffing are straining security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theft unfolded just 250 meters (270 yards) from the Mona Lisa, in what Culture Minister Rachida Dati described as a professional “four-minute operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One object, the emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum, French authorities said. It was reportedly recovered broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine. No one was hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing facade near a construction zone, since removed — the thieves’ entry point and, observers said, a striking vulnerability for a palace museum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A museum already under strain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 9:30 a.m., several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the glass display cases, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift via the riverfront facade, where construction is underway, to reach the hall with the 23-item royal collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their target was the gilded Apollon Gallery — where the Crown Diamonds are displayed, including the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thieves smashed two display cases and fled on motorbikes, Nunez said. Alarms brought Louvre agents to the room, forcing the intruders to bolt, but the theft was already done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a reliquary brooch; Empress Eugénie’s diadem; and her large corsage-bow brooch — a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s a major robbery,” Nunez said, noting that security measures at the Louvre had been strengthened in recent years and would be reinforced further as part of the museum’s upcoming overhaul plan. Officials said security upgrades include new-generation cameras, perimeter detection, and a new security control room. But critics say the measures come far too late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday for the forensic investigation to begin as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre with visitors present ranks among Europe’s most audacious in recent history, and at least since Dresden’s Green Vault museum in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa sits behind bulletproof glass in a climate-controlled case — but Sunday’s theft also underscored that protections are not uniformly as robust across the museum’s more than 33,000 objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theft is a fresh embarrassment for a museum already under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How can they ride a lift to a window and take jewels in the middle of the day?” said Magali Cunel, a French teacher from near Lyon. “It’s just unbelievable that a museum this famous can have such obvious security gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence. Another notorious episode came in 1956, when a visitor hurled a stone at her world-famous smile, chipping paint near her left elbow and hastening the move to display the work behind protective glass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilization: Leonardo’s Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi’s carved laws; Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People; Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa. The objects — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe’s masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Politics at the door&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,” Bardella wrote on X. “This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long “Louvre New Renaissance” plan — about €700 million ($760 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we know — and don’t&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of “inestimable” historical value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recovery may prove difficult. “It’s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,” said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds. “Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognizable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter. French authorities did not immediately comment on this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a guide by Andrej Karpathy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some advice I would give to younger students if they wish to do well in their undergraduate courses.&lt;lb/&gt; Having been tested for many years of my life (with pretty good results), here are some rules of thumb that I feel helped me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; All-nighters are not worth it. &lt;lb/&gt; Sleep does wonders. Optimal sleep time for me is around 7.5 hours, with an absolute minimum of around 4hrs.&lt;lb/&gt; It has happened to me several times that I was stuck on some problem for an hour in the night, but was able to solve it in 5 minutes in the morning. I feel like the brain "commits" a lot of shaky short-term memories to stable long-term memories during the night. I try to start studying for any big tests well in advance (several days), even if for short periods of time, to maximize the number of nights that my brain gets for the material. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Attend tutorials or review sessions.&lt;lb/&gt; Even if they are bad. The fact that they get you to think about the material is what counts. If its too boring, you can always work on something else. Remember that you can also try to attend a different tutorial with a different TA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Considering the big picture and organisation is the key. &lt;lb/&gt; Create schedule of study, even if you dont stick to it. For me this usually involves getting an idea of everything I need to know and explicitly writing it down in terms of bullet points. Consider all points carefully and think about how long it will take you to get them down. If you don't do this, there is a tendency to spend too much time on beginning of material and then skim through the (most important) later material due to lack of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always try to look at previous tests BEFORE starting to study.&lt;lb/&gt; Especially if the past tests were written by the same professor. This will give you strong hints about how you should study. Every professor has a different evaluation style. Don't actually attempt to complete the questions in the beginning, but take careful note of the type of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Reading and understanding IS NOT the same as replicating the content.&lt;lb/&gt; Even I often make this mistake still: You read a formula/derivation/proof in the book and it makes perfect sense. Now close the book and try to write it down. You will find that this process is completely different and it will amaze you that many times you won't actually be able to do this! Somehow the two things use different parts of the memory. Make it a point to make sure that you can actually write down the most important bits, and that you can re-derive them at will. Feynman famously knew this very well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always try to collaborate with others, but near the end. &lt;lb/&gt; Study alone first because in the early stages of studying others can only serve as a distraction. But near the end get together with others: they will often point out important pitfalls, bring up good issues, and sometimes give you an opportunity to teach. Which brings me to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Don't only hang out only with stronger students.&lt;lb/&gt; Weaker students will have you explain things to them and you will find that teaching the material helps A LOT with understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Go to the prof before final exam at least once for office hours. &lt;lb/&gt; Even if you have no questions (make something up!) Profs will sometimes be willing to say more about a test in 1on1 basis (things they would not disclose in front of the entire class). Don't expect it, but when this does happen, it helps a lot. Does this give you an unfair advantage over other students? Sometimes. It's a little shady :)&lt;lb/&gt; But in general it is a good idea to let the prof get to know you at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Study well in advance. &lt;lb/&gt; Did I mention this already? Maybe I should stress it again. The brain really needs time to absorb material. Things that looked hard become easier with time. &lt;lb/&gt; You want to alocate ~3 days for midterms, ~6 days for exams.&lt;lb/&gt; If things are going badly and you get too tired, in emergency situations, jug an energy drink.&lt;lb/&gt; They work. It's just chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; For things like math: Exercise &amp;gt; Reading.&lt;lb/&gt; It is good to study to the point where you are reasonably ready to start the exercises, but then fill in the gaps through doing exercises, especially if you have many available to you. The exercises will also make you go back and read things you don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Make yourself cheat sheet. &lt;lb/&gt; Even if you're not allowed to bring it to the exam. Writing things down helps. What you want is to cram the entire course on 1 or more pages that you can in the end tile in front of you and say with high degree of confidence "This is exactly everything I must know"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Study in places where other people study as well, even if not the same thing. &lt;lb/&gt; This makes you feel bad when you are the one not studying. It works for me :)&lt;lb/&gt; Places with a lot of background noise are bad and have a research-supported negative impact on learning. Libraries and Reading rooms work best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Optimal eating/drinking habit is: T-2 hours get coffee and food.&lt;lb/&gt; For me, Coffee or Food RIGHT before the test is ALWAYS bad&lt;lb/&gt; Coffee right before any potentially stressful situation is ALWAYS bad.&lt;lb/&gt; No coffee at all is bad.&lt;lb/&gt; I realize the coffee bit may be subjective to me, but its something to think about for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Study very intensely RIGHT before the test. &lt;lb/&gt; I see many people give up before the test and claim to "take a break". Short term memory is a wonderful thing, don't waste it! Study as intensely as possible right before the test. If you really feel you must take a break, take it about an hour before the test, but make sure you study really hard 30-45 minutes before the test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Always use pencil for tests. &lt;lb/&gt; You want to be able to erase your garbage "solutions"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Look over all questions very briefly before start. &lt;lb/&gt; A mere 1-3 second glance per question is good enough. Just absorb all key words, and get idea of the size of the entire test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; On test, do easy questions first. &lt;lb/&gt; Do not allow yourself to get stuck on something too long. Come back to it later. I skip questions all the time... Sometimes I can complete as little as 30% of the test on my first pass. Some questions somehow become much easier once you're "warmed up", I can't explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always try to be neat on the test. &lt;lb/&gt; Surprisingly few people actually realize this obvious fact: A human being will mark your test. A sad human being gives low marks. I suspected this as undergrad student and confirmed it strongly when I was TAing and actually marking. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Always BOX IN/CIRCLE the answer&lt;lb/&gt; Especially when there is derivation around it. This allows the marker to give you a quick check mark for full marks and move on. Get in the mindset of a marker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; NEVER. EVER. EVER. Leave test early. &lt;lb/&gt; You made a silly mistake (I guarantee it), find it and fix it. If you can't find it, try harder until time runs out. If you are VERY certain of no mistakes, work on making test more legible and easier to mark. Erase garbage, box in answers, add steps to proofs, etc.&lt;lb/&gt; I have no other way of putting this-- people who leave tests early are stupid. This is a clear example of a situation where potential benefits completely outweigh the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Communicate with the marker. &lt;lb/&gt; Show the marker that you know more than what you put down. Ok you can't do a particular step, but make it clear that you know how to proceed if you did. Don't be afraid to leave notes when necessary. Believe it or not the markers often end up trying to find you more marks-- make it easy for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Consider number of points per question.&lt;lb/&gt; Many tests will tell you how many marks every question is worth. This can give you very strong hints when you are doing something wrong. It also gives you strong hints at what questions you should be working on. It is, of course, silly to spend too much time on questions worth little marks that are still relatively hard for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; If there are &amp;lt;5 minutes left and you are still stuck on some question, STOP. &lt;lb/&gt; Your time is better spent re-reading all questions and making absolutely sure you did not miss any secondary&lt;lb/&gt; questions, and that you answered everything. You wouldn't believe how many silly marks people lose this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations if you got all the way here! Now that you are here, here's my last (very important advice). It is something that I wish someone had told me when I was an undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undergrads tend to have tunnel vision about their classes. They want to get good grades, etc. The crucial fact to realize is that noone will care about your grades, unless they are bad. For example, I always used to say that the smartest student will get 85% in all of his courses. This way, you end up with somewhere around 4.0 score, but you did not over-study, and you did not under-study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your time is a precious, limited resource. Get to a point where you don't screw up on a test and then switch your attention to much more important endeavors. What are they?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting actual, real-world experience, working on real code base, projects or problems outside of silly course exercises is extremely imporant. Professors/People who know you and can write you a good reference letter saying that you have initiative, passion and drive are extremely important. Are you thinking of applying to jobs? Get a summer internship. Are you thinking of pursuing graduate school? Get research experience! Sign up for whatever programs your school offers. Or reach out to a professor/graduate student asking to get involved on a research project you like. This might work if they think you're driven and motivated enough. Do not underestimate the importance of this: A well-known professor who writes in their recommendation letter that you are driven, motivated and independent thinker completely dwarfs anything else, especially petty things like grades. It also helps a lot if you squeeze in at least one paper before you apply. Also, you should be aware that the biggest pet peeve from their side are over-excited undergrad students who sign up for a project, meet a few times, ask many questions, and then suddenly give up and disappear after all that time investment from the graduate student's or professor's side. Do not be this person (it damages your reputation) and do not give any indication that you might be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than research projects, get involved with some group of people on side projects or better, start your own from scratch. Contribute to Open Source, make/improve a library. Get out there and create (or help create) something cool. Document it well. Blog about it. These are the things people will care about a few years down the road. Your grades? They are an annoyance you have to deal with along the way. Use your time well and good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The trinary dream endures&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, there has been an alternative vision for computing, not binary but trinary, also called ternary. (âTrinaryâ sounds so much better to me.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinary didnât make any headway in the 20th century; binaryâs direct mapping to the âonâ/âoffâ states of electric current was just too effective, or seductive; but remember that electric current isnât actually âonâ or âoffâ. It has taken a ton of engineering to âsimulateâ those abstract states in real, physical circuits, especially as they have gotten smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinary is philosophically appealing because its ground-floor vocabulary isnât âyesâ and ânoâ, but rather: âyesâ, ânoâ, and âmaybeâ. Itâs probably a bit much to imagine that this architectural difference could cascade up through the layers of abstraction and tend to produce software with subtler, richer values … yet I do imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trinary might still have its day. You can train a capable and super-efficient language model using weights of only -1, 0, and 1, and I believe many models in the future will use this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viva la âmaybeâ!&lt;/p&gt;To the blog home page&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I wish SSDs gave you CPU performance style metrics about their activity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern CPUs have an impressive collection of performance counters for detailed, low level information on things like cache misses, branch mispredictions, various sorts of stalls, and so on; on Linux you can use 'perf list' to see them all. Modern SSDs (NVMe, SATA, and SAS) are all internally quite complex, and their behavior under load depends on a lot of internal state. It would be nice to have CPU performance counter style metrics to expose some of those details. For a relevant example that's on my mind (cf), it certainly would be interesting to know how often flash writes had to stall while blocks were hastily erased, or the current erase rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having written this, I checked some of our SSDs (the ones I'm most interested in at the moment) and I see that our SATA SSDs do expose some of this information as (vendor specific) SMART attributes, with things like 'block erase count' and 'NAND GB written' to TLC or SLC (as well as the host write volume and so on stuff you'd expect). NVMe does this in a different way that doesn't have the sort of easy flexibility that SMART attributes do, so a random one of ours that I checked doesn't seem to provide this sort of lower level information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's understandable that SSD vendors don't necessarily want to expose this sort of information, but it's quite relevant if you're trying to understand unusual drive performance. For example, for your workload do you need to TRIM your drives more often, or do they have enough pre-erased space available when you need it? Since TRIM has an overhead, you may not want to blindly do it on a frequent basis (and its full effects aren't entirely predictable since they depend on how much the drive decides to actually erase in advance).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Having looked at SMART 'block erase count' information on one of our servers, it's definitely doing something when the server is under heavy fsync() load, but I need to cross-compare the numbers from it to other systems in order to get a better sense of what's exceptional and what's not.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently more focused on write related metrics, but there's probably important information that could be exposed for reads and for other operations. I'd also like it if SSDs provided counters for how many of various sorts of operations they saw, because while your operating system can in theory provide this, it often doesn't (or doesn't provide them at the granularity of, say, how many writes with 'Force Unit Access' or how many 'Flush' operations were done).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(In Linux, I think I'd have to extract this low level operation information in an ad-hoc way with eBPF tracing.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a hot topic among some of my nerdier SME friends, and our conclusion is that the major players are HPE and Nutanix. At least from our perspective over here in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HPE did a big brain move to support multiple hypervisor backends with their own frontend. The only way to go forward imho.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using Proxmox at my current $dayjob, and we're quite happy with it. I come from a big VMware shop and I think most businesses could easily replace VMware with Proxmox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Proxmox should just launch an Enterprise contract, regardless of the cost, just have one. Because right now I think the main obstacle halting adoption is their lack of any Enterprise SLA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a personal level I would love to see KubeVirt, or Openshift with KubeVirt, take over more. It just seems like a genius move to use the already established APIs of kubernetes with a hypervisor runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access to Enterprise repository Complete feature-set Support via Customer Portal Unlimited support tickets Response time: 2 hours* within a business day Remote support (via SSH) Offline subscription key activation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox is about to miss their window of opportunity here. They are uniquely positioned to take on VMWare, but their outfit seems like a fairly tiny and conservative company with zero ambition to take on the world, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they aren't interested in that business, then it isn't really a window of opportunity for them. In fact I respect a company that chooses to not pursue business opportunities that don't fit their goals, and instead focus on being a good fit for the market they are in. Growth isn't the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been at multiple companies that wasted millions courting large enterprise contacts only to not make a single sale. It does make the sales update more exciting though—if we just get this one sale…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't blame any company for wanting to stay out of that market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seeing a lot of Nutanix especially for VDI/Citrix heavy workloads or typical 3-tier applications. HP VME is also becoming a thing as an almost drop-in and VERY cost effective alternative to VMWare. In telco Openstack is still king AFAIK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm seeing a bit of everything: renegotiating (which Broadcom doesn't really do), optimizing and consolidating hosts (to lower costs), public cloud migration (which is why I see the most given my line of work, but may not represent everything), forays into other hypervisors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox may come to many an HN visitor's mind (and I use it myself extensively, all my home services run on it), but it actually doesn't have a lot of enterprise features and isn't a drop-in replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my sphere most companies are going to either Hyper-V or the cloud. Hyper-V kinda won by default as a lot of orgs already had Windows Server licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think Proxmox is anywhere near ready for that sort of shift. It's interesting what a big hole in the market VMWare is leaving and nothing quite fills it. OpenStack is the closest, but way more complicated than VMWare, and doesn't work at all for smaller deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
