  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a storage cluster in downtown SF to store 90 million hours worth of video data. Why? We’re pretraining models to solve computer use. Compared to text LLMs like LLaMa-405B, which require ~60 TB of text data to train, videos are sufficiently large that we need 500 times more storage. Instead of paying the $12 million / yr it would cost to store all of this on AWS, we rented space from a colocation center in San Francisco to bring that cost down ~40x to $354k per year, including depreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our use case for data is unique. Most cloud providers care highly about redundancy, availability, and data integrity, which tends to be unnecessary for ML training data. Since pretraining data is a commodity—we can lose any individual 5% with minimal impact—we can handle relatively large amounts of data corruption compared to enterprises who need guarantees that their user data isn’t going anywhere. In other words, we don’t need AWS’s 13 nines of reliability; 2 is more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, storage tends to be priced substantially above cost. Most companies use relatively small amounts of storage (even ones like Discord still use under a petabyte for messages), and the companies that use petabytes are so large that storage remains a tiny fraction of their total compute spend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data is one of our biggest contraints, and would be prohibitively expensive otherwise. As long as the cost predictions work out in favor of a local datacenter, and it would not consume too much of the core team’s time, it would make sense to stack hard drives ourselves. [1] 1. We talked to some engineers at the Internet Archive, which had basically the same problem as us; even after massive friends &amp;amp; family discounts on AWS, it was still 10 times more cost-effective to buy racks and store the data themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Cost Breakdown: Cloud Alternatives vs In-House&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internet and electricity total $17.5k as our only recurring expenses (the price of colocation space, cooling, etc were bundled into electricity costs). One-time costs were dominated by hard drive capex. [2] 2. When deciding the datacenter location we had multiple options across the Bay Area, including options in Fremont through Hurricane Electric for around $10k in setup fees and $12.8k per month, saving us $38.5k initially and $4.7k per month, but ended up opting for a datacenter that was only a couple blocks from our office in SF. Though this came at a premium, it was extremely helpful to get the initial nodes setup and for ongoing maintenance. Our team is just 5 people, so any friction in going to the datacenter would come at a noticeable cost to team productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Table 1: Cost comparison of cloud alternatives vs in-house. AWS is $1,130,000/month including estimated egress, Cloudflare is $270,000/month (with bulk-discounted pricing), and our datacenter is $29,500/month (including recurring costs and depreciation).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our price assuming three-year depreciation (including for the one-off install fees) is $17.5k/month in fixed monthly costs (internet, power, etc.) and $12k/month in depreciation, for $29.5k/month overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We compare our costs to two main providers: AWS’s public pricing numbers as a baseline, and Cloudflare’s discounted pricing for 30PB of storage. It’s important to note that AWS egress would be substantially lower if we utilized AWS GPUs. This is not reflected on our graph because AWS GPUs are priced at substantially above market prices and large clusters are difficult to attain, untenable at our compute scales.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;$0.015/GB/month&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$450,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No egress fees&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Estimated Private Pricing [3] 3. Cloudflare has a more reasonable estimate for the 30 PB, placing it at an overall monthly cost of $270k without egress fees. We also have bulk-discounted pricing estimates after getting pricing quotes—this was our main point of comparison for the datacenter.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$0.009/GB/month&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$270,000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Estimated rate for &amp;gt;20 PB scale&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That brings monthly costs to $38/TB/month for AWS, $10/TB/month for Cloudflare, and $1/TB/month for our datacenter—about 38x lower and 10x lower respectively. (At the very cheapest end of the spectrum, Backblaze has a $6/TB product that is unsuitable for model training due to egress speed limitations; their $15/TB Overdrive AI-specific storage product is closer to Cloudflare’s in price &amp;amp; performance)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we use Cloudflare as a comparison point, we’ve sometimes done too much load for their R2 servers. In particular, in the past we’ve done enough load during large model training runs that they rate-limited us, later confirming we were saturating their metadata layer and the rate limit wasn’t synthetic. Because our metadata on the heap is so simple, and we have a 100Gbps DIA connection, we haven’t ran into any issues there. [4] 4. We love Cloudflare and use many of their products often; we include this anecdote as a fact about our scale being difficult to handle, not as a dig!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup was and is necessary for our video data pipelines, and we’re extremely happy that we made this investment. By gathering large scale data at low costs, we can be competitive with frontier labs with billions of dollars in capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setup/The Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We cared a lot about getting this built fast, because this kind of project can easily stretch on for months if not careful. Hence Storage Stacking Saturday, or S3. We threw a hard drive stacking party in downtown SF and got our friends to come, offering food and custom-engraved hard drives to all who helped. The hard drive stacking started at 6am and continued for 36 hours (with a break to sleep), and by the end of that time we had 30 PB of functioning hardware racked and wired up. We brought in contractors for additional help and professional installation later on in the event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People at the hard drive stacking party! Cool shots of the servers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our software is 200 lines of Rust code for writing (to determine the drive to write data onto) and a nginx webserver for reading data, with a simple SQLite db for tracking metadata like which heap node each file is on and what data split it belongs to. We kept this obsessively simple instead of using MinIO or Ceph because we didn’t need any of the features they provided; it’s much, much simpler to debug a 200-line program than to debug Ceph, and we weren’t worried about redundancy or sharding. All our drives were formatted with XFS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage software landscape offers many options, but every option available comes with drawbacks. People experienced with Ceph strongly warned us to avoid it unless we were willing to hire dedicated Ceph specialists—our research confirmed this advice. Ceph appears far more complex than justified for most use cases, only worthwhile for companies that absolutely need maximum performance and customizability and are prepared to invest heavily in tuning. Minio presents an interesting option if S3 compatibility is essential, but otherwise remains a bit too fancy for us and similar use-cases. Weka and Vast are absurdly expensive at 2k / TB / year or so and are primarily designed for NVMEs, not spinning disks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Post-Mortem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building the datacenter was a large endeavor and we definitely learned lessons, both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Things That We Got Correct&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We think the redundancy &amp;amp; capability tradeoffs we made are very reasonable at our disk speeds. We’re able to approximately saturate our 100G network for both read &amp;amp; write.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Doing this locally a couple blocks away was well worth it because of the amount of debugging and manual work needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ebay is good to find vendors but bad to actually buy things with. After finding vendors, they can often individually supply all the parts we need and provide warranties, which are extremely valuable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;100G dedicated internet is pretty important, and much much easier to debug issues with than using cloud products.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having high-quality cable management during the racking process saved us a ton of time debugging in the long run; making it easy to switch up the networking saved us a lot of headache.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We had a very strong simplicity prior, and this saved an immense amount of effort. We are quite happy that we didn’t use ceph or minio. Unlike e.g. nginx, they do not work out of the box. We were willing to write a simple Rust script and roughly saturated our network read &amp;amp; write at 100 Gbps without any fancy code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We were basically right about the price and advantages this offered, and did not substantially overestimate the amount of time / effort it would take. While the improvements list is longer than this, most of those are minor; fundamentally we built a cluster rivaling massive clouds for 40x cheaper.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Difficult Bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A map of reality only gets you so far—while setting up the datacenter we ran into a couple problems and unexpected challenges. We’ll include a list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We used frontloaders instead of toploaders for our server rack. This meant we had to screw every single individual drive in—tedious for 2.4k HDDs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our storage was not dense—we could have saved 5x the work on physical placement and screwing by having a denser array of hard drives&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shortcuts like daisy-chaining are usually a bad idea. We could have gotten substantially higher read/write speeds without daisy chaining networked nodes, giving each chassis its own HBA (Host Bus Adapter, not a significant cost).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compatibility is key—specifically in networking functionally everything is locked to a specific brand. We had many pain points here. Fiber transceivers will ~never work unless used with the right brand, but copper cables are much more forgiving. FS.com is pretty good and well priced (though their speed estimates were pretty inconsistent); Amazon will also often have the parts you need rapidly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Networking came at substantial cost and required experimentation. In general, with our relatively non-sensitive training data, we optimized for convenience and ease of use over all else: we did not use DHCP as our used enterprise switches didn’t support it out of the box, and we didn’t use NAT as we wanted public IPs for the nodes for convenient and performant access from our servers. (We firewalled off unused ports and had basic security with nginx secure_link; we would not be able to do this if handling customer data, but it was fine for our use case.) While this is an area where we would have saved time with a cloud solution, we had our networking up within days and kinks ironed out within ~3 weeks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We were often bottlenecked by easy access to servers via monitor/keyboard; idle crash carts during setup are helpful.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ideas Worth Trying&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Working KVMs are extremely useful, and you shouldn’t go without them or good IPMI. Physically going to a datacenter is really inconvenient, even if it’s a block away. IPMI is good, but only if you have pretty consistent machines.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Think through your management Ethernet network as much as your real network - it’s really nice to be able to SSH into servers while configuring the network, and IPMI is great!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overprovision your network—e.g. if doable it’s worth having 400 Gigabit internally (you can use 100G cards etc for this!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We could have substantially increased density at additional upfront cost by buying 90-drive SuperMicro SuperServers and putting 20TB drives into them. This would allow us to use 2 racks instead of 10, give us about the equivalent of 20 AMD 9654s in total CPU capacity, and use less total power.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How You Can Build This Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to replicate our setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Storage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;10 CPU head nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We used Intel Rr2000 with Dual Intel Gold 6148 and 128GB of DDR4 ECC RAM per server (which are incredibly cheap and roughly worked for our use cases) but you have a lot of flexibility in what you use.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;If you use the above configuration you likely won’t be able to do anything at all CPU-intensive on the servers (like on-device data processing or ZFS data compression / deduplication / etc, which is valuable if you’re storing non-video data).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Our CPU nodes cost $600 each—it seems quite reasonable to us to spend up to $3k each if you want ZFS / compression or the abiliy to do data processing on-CPU.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;100 DS4246 chassis—each can hold 24 hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2,400 3.5 inch HDDs—need to be all SATA or all SAS in each chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We would recommend SAS hard drives if possible [5] 5. if you use SAS drives you’ll need to deal with or disable mulipathing, which is reasonably simple as they roughly double speed over similar SATA drives.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We used a mix of 12TB and 14TB drives—basically any size should work, roughly the larger the better holding price constant (density makes stacking easier + in general increases resale value).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Physical parts to mount the chassis—you’ll need rails or l-brackets. We used l-brackets which worked well, as we haven’t needed to take the chassis out to slot hard drives. If you buy toploaders, you’ll need rails.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multiple “crash carts” with monitors and keyboards that allow you to physically connect to your CPU head nodes and configure them—this is invaluable when you’re debugging network issues.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Network&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A 100 GbE switch&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;A used Arista is fine, should be QSFP28, should cost about $1-2k.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HBAs (Host Bus Adapters), which connect your head nodes to your DS4246 chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The best configuration we tried was with Broadcom 9305-16E HBAs, with 3x HBAs per server (make sure your server has physical space for them!) with SFF-8644 to QSFP mini SAS cables.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;There are 4 slots per HBA, so you can cable each DS4246 chassis directly to the HBA. [6] 6. The option we ended up going with for convenience was putting LSI SAS9207-8e HBAs, which have 2 ports each, into the CPU head nodes- then daisy-chaining the DS4246s together with QSFP+ to QSFP+ DACs.. We deployed this on Storage Stacking Saturday, then while debugging speeds tried the above method on one of the servers and got to ~4 Gbps per chassis-but didn’t find it worth it to swap everything out in pure labor because of the way we had set up some of our head nodes such that they were difficult to take out. Insofar as it is reasonably cheap to just do the above thing to start and we’ve tested it to work, you should probably do as we say, not as we did in this case!&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Network cards (NICs).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We used Mellanox ConnectX-4 100GbE. Make sure they come in Ethernet mode and not Infiniband mode for ease of config.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DAC (Direct Attach Copper) or AOC (Active Optical) cables, to connect the NICs in your head nodes to your switch and therefore the internet. You almost certainly want DACs if your racks are close together, as they are far more compatible with arbitrary networking equipment than AOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We would recommend that you find a supplier to sell you the CPU head nodes with the HBAs and NICs installed—there are a number of used datacenter / enterprise parts suppliers who are willing to do this. This is a substantial positive because it means that you don’t have to spend hours installing the HBAs/NICs yourself and can have a substantially higher degree of confidence in your operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Serial cables—you’ll need these to connect to your switch!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Optional but recommended: an Ethernet management network of some kind. If you can’t easily get ethernet, we’d recommend getting a wifi adapter like this and then a ethernet switch like this —it’s substantially easier to set up than the 100GbE, is a great backup for when that’s not working, and will allow you to do ~everything over SSH from the comfort of the office instead of in the datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Datacenter Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3.5 kW of usable power per cabinet, with 10 4U chassis + 1 2U (cabinets are 42U tall)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 spare cabinet for the 1U or 2U 100GbE switch (you can obviously also just swap out one of the 4U chassis in another cabinet for the switch).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 42U cabinet per 3 PB of storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A dedicated 100G connection (will come in as a fiber pair probably via QSFP28 LR4, but confirm with your datacenter provider before buying parts here!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ideally physically near your office—there is a lot of value in being able to walk over and debug issues instead of e.g. dealing with remote hands services to get internet to the nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some setup tips:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure to first properly configure your switch. Depending on your switch model this should be relatively straightforward—you’ll need to physically connect to the switch and then configure the specific port that your 100GbE is connected to (you’ll get a fiber cross-connect from your datacenter that you should plug into a QSFP28 transceiver. Make sure that you get a transceiver that is compatible in form with the ISP, probably LR4, and specifically branded with your switch brand, otherwise it is very unlikely to work). Depending on your ISP you might have to talk to them to make sure that you can get “light” through the fiber cables from both ends, which might involve rolling the fiber and otherwise making sure it’s working properly. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If your switch isn’t working / you haven’t configured one before, I’d suggest trying to directly plug the fiber cable from the ISP into one of your 10 heap servers, making sure to buy a transceiver that is compatible with your NIC brand (e.g. Mellanox). Once you get it working from there, move over to your switch and get it working.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once you can connect to the internet from your switch (simply ping 1.1.1.1 to check) you are ready to set up the netplans for the individual nodes. this is most easily done during the Ubuntu setup process, which will walk you through setting up internet for your CPU head nodes, but is also doable outside of that&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have internet access to your nodes and have properly connected 1 cable to each DS4246, you should format &amp;amp; mount the drives on each node, test that all of them are properly working, and then you are ready to deploy any software you want.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Two Years After Cormac McCarthy’s Death, Rare Access to His Personal Library Reveals the Man Behind the Myth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The famously reclusive novelist amassed a collection of thousands of books ranging in topics from philosophical treatises to advanced mathematics to the naked mole-rat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cormac McCarthy, one of the greatest novelists America has ever produced and one of the most private, had been dead for 13 months when I arrived at his final residence outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was a stately old adobe house, two stories high with beam-ends jutting out of the exterior walls, set back from a country road in a valley below the mountains. First built in 1892, the house was expanded and modernized in the 1970s and extensively modified by McCarthy himself, who, it turns out, was a self-taught architect as well as a master of literary fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was invited to the house by two McCarthy scholars who were embroiled in a herculean endeavor. Working unpaid, with help from other volunteer scholars and occasional graduate students, they had taken it upon themselves to physically examine and digitally catalog every single book in McCarthy’s enormous and chaotically disorganized personal library. They were guessing it contained upwards of 20,000 volumes. By comparison, Ernest Hemingway, considered a voracious book collector, left behind a personal library of 9,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes McCarthy’s library so intriguing is not just its size, nor the fact that very few people know about it. His books, many of which are annotated with margin comments, promise to reveal far more about this elusive literary giant than the few cagey interviews he gave when he was alive. For as long as people have been reading McCarthy, they have speculated about which books and authors informed and inspired his work, a subject he was loath to discuss. They have wondered about his interests and true personality because all he presented to the public was a reclusive, austere, inscrutable facade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Bryan Giemza, a scholar of literature and humanities at Texas Tech University, offered me exclusive journalistic access to McCarthy’s library and the cataloging project, what he was really offering was an unprecedented insight into McCarthy’s life and work. As a further enticement, he said that Cormac’s younger brother Dennis McCarthy would be there. “Dennis probably knew him as well as anyone,” Giemza said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Did You Know? Who was Cormac McCarthy?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cormac McCarthy is an award-winning novelist whose works often explored the American West with darkness and complexity. Among McCarthy's many awards are a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969, a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2007 for The Road and a National Book award in 1992 for All the Pretty Horses.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I parked behind the house between a silver 1966 Buick Riviera rusting on deflated tires and a weathered red Lincoln Mark VIII. These were among the last survivors of McCarthy’s little-known vehicle collection. Dennis had sold 13 other cars, including two Allard racing cars from the early 1950s, a 1992 Lotus and a Ford GT40 racing car. McCarthy, who labored in obscurity and chronic poverty until he was 60, became a multi-millionaire later in life and freely indulged his desires and obsessions, with classic sports cars high on the list. Most of the money came from Hollywood, which turned three of his novels—All the Pretty Horses, No Country for Old Men and The Road—into star-studded movies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knocked on the imposing front door, an Indo-Portuguese antique made of teak and fortified with iron strappings, metal studs, flattened nails and small chains. There was no response, so I tried the handle. The door swung open and revealed a dimly lit hallway reduced to a narrow passage by head-high stacks of cardboard boxes on both sides. All those boxes were packed with books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first room off the hallway—the room where McCarthy died at age 89—was now so crammed with book boxes that it was impenetrable. Scholars called it “the Beast Room.” The next room was nearly as full. One open box showed volumes about the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, country houses in Ireland, schizophrenia, African history and British antique rifle barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the dining room, underneath a beautiful hanging light fixture of wood and colored glass that McCarthy designed and built himself, scholars were sitting at the table, scanning books’ ISBN bar codes through their phones into the library cataloging software on their laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found Giemza in the living room, wrestling with an internet connectivity problem. “Cormac didn’t have Wi-Fi in the house, so we had to bring our own,” he said. Nor did McCarthy use a computer—ever. He typed out his pages on a cheap, durable Olivetti typewriter and, I learned later, did most of his work propped up on pillows in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The living room, like the house in general, had a sturdy, old-fashioned and decidedly masculine feel, but its clean lines were obscured by a chaotic overlay of clutter—mainly books, but also piles of nameless junk and hundreds of bowls, glasses and kitchenware items still in their packaging. Some of the book boxes and loose books had been moved into the room for the cataloging project, but not the rest of it. One of the first discoveries made by the visiting scholars was that McCarthy was something of a hoarder. His particular fixation on kitchenware, much of it bargain kitchenware, remains mysterious and a mark of his eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second major discovery, discernible in his work but confirmed beyond doubt in his library, was that McCarthy was a genius-level intellectual polymath with an insatiable curiosity. His interests ranged from quantum physics, which he taught himself by reading 190 books on the notoriously challenging subject, to whale biology, violins, obscure corners of French history in the early Middle Ages, the highest levels of advanced mathematics and almost any other subject you can name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giemza marveled at the heavy-duty philosophy books they were finding. “Seventy-five titles by or about Wittgenstein so far,” he said, referring to the Austrian philosopher of mathematics, logic, language and the mind. “And most of them are annotated, meaning Cormac read them closely. A lot of Hegel. That was his light evening reading, apparently.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the living room was a pool table piled with books and a leather couch facing two tall windows and three sets of nine-foot-tall wooden bookshelves designed by McCarthy that held approximately 1,000 books. Moving closer, I saw they were nearly all nonfiction hardbacks with no obvious system of organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One shelf held volumes about Mesoamerican&lt;lb/&gt; history and archaeology, along with Charles Darwin’s collected notebooks, Victor Klemperer’s three-volume diary of the Nazi years, books about organic chemistry and sports cars, and an obscure volume titled The Biology of the Naked Mole-Rat (Monographs in Behavior and Ecology). Another shelf held books about Grand Prix and Formula 1 racing, a great passion of McCarthy’s, and the collected writings of Charles S. Peirce, the American scientist, philosopher and logician, in six fat volumes of dense, difficult prose. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to take it all in, I felt both fascinated and overwhelmed. It seemed almost inconceivable that an author who produced 12 novels, two plays and five screenplays had also found the time, energy and brainpower to master architecture, woodworking, stonemasonry and a wide range of intellectual disciplines. Some of his math books were nearly all equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we found an intricate drawing he’d made for an engine modification to one of his cars, and another showing how to rifle a gun barrel with hand tools. We found dozens of well-thumbed engine repair manuals and auto mechanic’s tools in the outbuildings, and learned that he could disassemble, reassemble and redesign an engine to increase its horsepower. Then I learned he had an eidetic memory and could remember nearly everything he had read or heard, including the lyrics to thousands of songs. McCarthy was starting to seem like a man whose talents and intelligence were without limits, yet he lived in a hoarder’s shambles and couldn’t stop buying nonstick skillets and fruit bowls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By studying his library more closely, I hoped to gain a better understanding of McCarthy, but it was possible the mystery of his character would only deepen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giemza introduced me to his colleague Stacey Peebles, a professor of film and English at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and the current president of the Cormac McCarthy Society. It was Peebles who first met with Dennis McCarthy, the author’s brother and literary executor, and suggested that the society take on the monumental task of cataloging the books. The society’s mission is to further the study and appreciation of McCarthy’s work, and Peebles thought there was enough material in the library to keep scholars busy for decades—scrutinizing the annotations, tracing connections between the research books and passages in the novels, interpreting literary and philosophical influences. “If we were a well-funded institution, we’d take all these boxes into an empty building where we had plenty of space to work in, a dedicated team of people and all the time we needed,” she said. But Peebles and her small team all have full-time jobs, so the project has required a trade-off between detail and efficiency. “We can’t be as meticulous as we’d like and scan all the annotations, because we’ve got limited time and a massive amount of books to get through.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy often had a pencil when he was reading and would make tiny vertical marks next to sentences that interested him and add comments in the margins in small print handwriting. Sometimes he jotted down thoughts on slips of paper that he left between the pages. Inside The Life of Saint Teresa of Ávila by Herself, first published in 1565, we found him musing philosophically: “There is an intelligence to the universe (of which we are fractal) and that intelligence has a character and that character is benign. Intends well toward all things. How could it not?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy is known for the bleak, violent nihilism in many of his novels, so it was a surprise to see him describing the universe as intelligent and well-&lt;lb/&gt; intentioned. He was a lapsed Catholic who went back and forth on the question of God’s existence, sometimes changing his mind from one day to the next. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peebles was collecting her favorite annotated books on the pool table. One was Realism in Mathematics by Penelope Maddy. In the margins, Mc-&lt;lb/&gt; Carthy summarizes the author’s points and comments on them, frequently disagreeing. “Gibberish,” he noted at one point. It was an exciting find for the scholars because McCarthy mined this book deeply for his final novel, Stella Maris. Its protagonist, Alicia Western, is a young mathematical genius with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another of Peebles’ favorite finds is an annotated copy of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. McCarthy, who once said, “the ugly fact is books are made out of books,” borrowed and altered elements from Hamlet for his 1979 novel Suttree. It was his most ornate and poetic book and the closest he ever came to writing autobiographically. The main character is a troubled dropout who has rejected a life of privilege and responsibility in Knoxville, Tennessee, where McCarthy grew up as the black sheep among six children in a well-to-do Catholic family with strong Irish roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was born in 1933 and christened Charles Joseph McCarthy Jr. after his father. In his youth, he was known as Charlie, or sometimes Doc, until he changed his name to Cormac as a young man, partly inspired by the medieval Irish king Cormac mac Airt. The name change was probably also a declaration of independence from his father. Charles McCarthy Sr. was an attorney who became the chief counsel for the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Cormac always characterized him as a domineering, violent man who beat him viciously for trivial offenses. (His brother Dennis disputes this description and says that Cormac was “grossly exaggerating.“)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy told his own son John, and some of his friends, that the beatings started when he was 3 years old. Readers and critics have often wondered where the darkness and violence in McCarthy’s work comes from, and, if Cormac’s characterization is true, his childhood might account for some of it. He loved his mother, Gladys, but she was psychologically fragile and frequently absent from the family in mental health institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He hated his Catholic school and loved roaming outdoors. Talking about his school days in a (rare) 1992 interview, McCarthy said, “There was no hobby I didn’t have, name anything, no matter how esoteric, I had found it and dabbled in it.” He made money trapping muskrats around Knoxville and selling the pelts, and somehow also established himself as an authority on antique American rifles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1953, McCarthy dropped out of the University of Tennessee, where he was studying engineering and physics, and joined the Air Force. He was stationed in Anchorage, where he became the radio disc jockey for the base, and started reading in earnest in his spare time. After four years, he returned to the University of Tennessee but dropped out again and started writing novels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first three, The Orchard Keeper, Outer Dark and Child of God, were gothic tales set in the rural Appalachia he knew from his youth. In lyrical prose with marvelously rendered vernacular speech, they tackled dark subjects—murder, infanticide, incest, necrophilia—while displaying a reverence for nature and folk traditions. The fourth novel was Suttree, McCarthy’s richly comedic evocation of 1950s Knoxville. These novels earned critical praise and prestigious grants and awards, but each sold more poorly than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the few details we have about McCarthy’s personal life comes from his second wife, Anne&lt;lb/&gt; DeLisle, an English singer and dancer, whom he met on a ship to Ireland in 1965. Their home was a partially converted dairy barn outside Knoxville; they bathed in a lake. “Someone would call up and offer him $2,000 to come speak at a university about his books,” she once said. “And he would tell them that everything he had to say was there on the page. So we would eat beans for another week.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After leaving her without an explanation in 1974, McCarthy drifted around cheap motels with his typewriter, a pile of books and a light bulb for good reading light. In 1976 McCarthy took up residence in El Paso and turned his attention on the American Southwest and northern Mexico, setting himself the task of learning the culture, history, natural history, geology, folkways and distinctive Spanish idioms of the borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to a letter he wrote, McCarthy read over 300 books to research Blood Meridian (1985), an ultraviolent philosophical Western based on the true story of a state-funded scalp-hunting gang in the 1840s and 1850s. Now widely regarded as his greatest masterpiece, it sold a pitiful 1,883 copies when it was first published. McCarthy’s fortunes changed with the publication of All the Pretty Horses in 1992. This elegiac Western, set in 1949 and 1950 in Texas and Mexico, became a best seller, won a National Book Award, and was adapted into a movie starring Matt Damon and Penélope Cruz. McCarthy followed with two more novels about drifting cowboys, then shifted course with No Country for Old Men (2005), a crime thriller that the Coen brothers turned into a quadruple-Oscar-winning movie starring Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones. Next came The Road, a post-apocalyptic father-son journey that won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2007 and was made into a film with Viggo Mortensen playing the father.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy had moved to Santa Fe with his third wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their young son John in 2001. He found the town off-puttingly liberal, moneyed and artsy, and moved there for one reason only: His great friend Murray Gell-Mann, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, invited him to join the Santa Fe Institute, serving as a sort of in-house literary intellectual. This elite scientific think tank, co-founded by Gell-Mann, brings together some of the world’s most brilliant minds to research complex interconnected systems. McCarthy had long preferred the company of scientists to that of literary people, and he delighted in the high-flying conversations at the institute. He went there nearly every day to work on his writing and kept up with all the institute’s scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy was famous for refusing to discuss his work, so there was widespread amazement in literary quarters when he agreed to do a televised interview in 2007 with Oprah Winfrey, who had picked The Road as her book club selection. Viewers saw a courteous, gray-haired Southerner with a high-domed forehead and a flashing smile. When Oprah asked if he was “passionate” about writing, he replied, “Passionate sounds like a pretty fancy word.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oprah, knowing it was true, asked if The Road was a love story to his young son John. “In a way, I suppose, that’s kind of embarrassing,” he said. She made slightly better headway on the subject of punctuation. McCarthy didn’t use quotation marks, hated semicolons and kept commas to the barest minimum. “There’s no reason to block the page up with weird little marks,” he said. “If you write properly, you shouldn’t have to punctuate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy could pull it off because he was a virtuoso, renowned for his powers of description and ear for dialogue. The Nobel Prize-winning novelist Saul Bellow extolled McCarthy’s “absolutely overpowering use of language, his life-giving and death-dealing sentences.” McCarthy’s detractors, meanwhile, found his writing overly mannered, his characters overly masculine, and accused him of relishing the violence he wrote about so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When McCarthy died in June 2023, after battling leukemia, prostate cancer, dehydration and what he once called “the sheer velocity of time,” the accolades were immediate, and fulsome. Stephen King called him the “last great white male American novelist.” Sebastian Junger compared him to Mount Everest. The Guardian headlined its remembrance with a prophecy: “His work will sing down the centuries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dennis McCarthy, the youngest of the six children, made his way through the book-choked hallway into the book-strewn living room. A retired lawyer, editor and conservation biologist, Dennis published his first novel in 2021, a spiritual Western about Billy the Kid. Now 81, he was fit and trim, with blue eyes, a radiant smile and a strong resemblance to Cormac. “He was my best friend for 70 years and a fabulous older brother who always looked out for me,” he said. “We were very, very close.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked him which authors his brother most admired. “Moby-Dick was Cormac’s favorite book without question, and Faulkner was more of an influence than he liked to admit,” he said. “He loved Hemingway’s short stories, James Joyce, Dostoyevsky and Shakespeare of course.” Readers and scholars had already identified these literary forebears, but it was satisfying to hear them confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of the many thousands of books in the house, the basement and the outbuildings, how many had McCarthy actually read? “If you exclude the encyclopedias and reference books, I would guess about 85 percent,” Dennis said. “Cormac kept on ordering books after he was too sick and frail to read, because it was a compulsion, but until that point he would read for hours and hours nearly every day. He never left the house without a book. He never left the house without a gun. Both were equally unthinkable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why was he always armed? “He was a conservative country boy from the South who understood that the world is a dangerous place.” When he was 24, McCarthy accidentally shot himself in the leg while practicing alone on a gun range in Tennessee. Dennis didn’t know any more details, because his brother refused to discuss the incident, but it was likely a quick-draw gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I asked Dennis about his brother’s reputation as a recluse, he said it was totally inaccurate. “He was very sociable and could get along with anybody. Well, almost anybody. He didn’t suffer fools gladly, or people who rushed up to him gushing about his books. But he had a lot of friends, and he loved dining and conversation, and five-hour lunches that sometimes turned into ten-hour lunches.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those friends included physicists and quark-discoverers Gell-Mann and George Zweig, the whale biologist Roger Payne, the movie star Josh Brolin, plus a bar owner in Tucson who calls himself God and a silver-tongued con man from Knoxville named John Sheddan, who appears exactly as himself under his own name in McCarthy’s penultimate novel, The Passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brolin got to know McCarthy during the filming of No Country for Old Men and was at the author’s bedside the night before he died. “It was me, his ex-wife, his son John, and that was it,” Brolin tells me on the phone. “He was telling these wild stories, about drinking wine with André the Giant in Paris, and all this stuff was coming out totally lucid, sharp, funny, inspired. Then he would go into this lost dementia and he’d be grabbing at stuff that wasn’t there. Then he’d go to sleep, and then he’d wake up and tell another story.” Soon after Brolin left, McCarthy drew his final breath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s son John, the model for the boy character in The Road, was now 26 and sleeping in his father’s old bedroom upstairs. He’s a licensed pilot, a composer and a musician. The first time I met John, he was coming sleepily down the wooden stairs in search of coffee. I had just learned that Dennis had emptied two storage units full of books in El Paso and two more in Santa Fe and moved the boxes into the house for cataloging. “So I’m getting a totally unrealistic picture of what the house was like when you were growing up here,” I said to John.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Not really,” he said. “This is pretty much how it was. Boxes everywhere. Piles of books everywhere. The hallway stacked up with boxes with a little path through the middle. Whole rooms so full of books you couldn’t go in there. It didn’t bother me at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was John who told me that McCarthy worked in bed—a California king with high-thread-count sheets, the Olivetti on a wooden platform with a leather pillow underneath it, and piles of typed pages, magazines, books and catalogs. Writing, McCarthy once said, was not a conscious process for him. He put a blank piece of paper in the Olivetti, the words arrived, and he typed them down. But that was just the first stage of an extensive rewriting and structuring process, and some of his books took 20 years or more to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Dad didn’t like being interrupted when he was working, or when he was reading,” John said. “‘No, no, no. I’m reading. Go away!’ he would say. But he was a great father, always there for me, and I learned so much from him. We would have these long conversations about science and history and music, and whatever else, and he was the funniest person I’ve ever met, just a natural comedian.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked John what else his father collected apart from books, cars and kitchenware. “I would say clothes were the other big one. He had hundreds of tweed jackets, hundreds of shirts, hundreds of suits that he’d never worn.” John once spent three days dragging stuff out of a room he wanted to use as a bedroom. “When I was done, I said, ‘You ever think you might be a little bit of a hoarder?’ And he looks at me and he goes, ‘Yeah, probably.’ He attributed it to all those years when he had no money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dennis isn’t buying that explanation. “Cormac always lived in chaos, which I found fascinating because he had such a fabulous artistic sense. He could design things beautifully and he dressed impeccably, but his living quarters were always a disaster. He was an incredibly complicated individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cataloging scholars could only spare four or five days at a time. Then they would go back to their jobs for a few months and try to carve out another long weekend in New Mexico. The stalwarts were Peebles and Rick and Jonathan Elmore, whip-smart twin brothers who looked nothing alike, taught at different colleges and wrote academic papers together about McCarthy’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cataloging was dusty, repetitive, eye-straining work, but it was conducted with good humor and camaraderie, and you never knew what might come out of the next box. One afternoon, after looking through a batch about Cistercian abbeys, violin makers, metaphysics, meta-ontology, the incest taboo and the material foundations of ancient Mesopotamian civilization, I said, “Was there anything he wasn’t interested in? Sewing perhaps?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Nope,” said Jonathan Elmore, an English professor at Louisiana Tech University. “We’ve cataloged books on needlework and quilting.” Rick noted McCarthy’s keen interest in clothes and fashion, which could, I granted, be described as sewing-related. McCarthy was a longtime subscriber to the fashion and style magazine W, and he had annotated many of his books about menswear. In his copy of The Suit: A Machiavellian Approach to Men’s Style, McCarthy penciled his opinion of slip-on dress shoes: “disgusting.” Further down the same page, next to a sentence praising shiny-buckled monk-strap shoes, he wrote, “yet more horror.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scholars treated annotations like pieces of treasure and would read them aloud to each other. Inside Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, they found notes on a slip of paper, including a line about the assassin’s bullet: “it was going like a bat out of hell when it left the president’s head and in that crowd it is a pure freak of chance that it didn’t take out a citizen-spectator.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historical figures who interested McCarthy the most, judging by the number of books he owned about them, were Albert Einstein (114 books), Winston Churchill (88) and James Joyce (78). Architecture is the dominant subject in the collection, with 855 books. The human being whom McCarthy most admired, Dennis confirms, was Ludwig Wittgenstein. The team cataloged a staggering 142 books by or about the philosopher, with a high proportion annotated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy’s fascination with Wittgenstein came as a surprise to the scholars, but it makes sense. As Rick Elmore, a philosophy professor at Appalachian State University with floral tattoos climbing up his neck, puts it, “Wittgenstein was always asking how the systems we use to represent the world relate to the world we want to represent. It’s one of the central questions in McCarthy’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the exception of Moby-Dick in multiple, gorgeous leather-bound editions, the scholars found hardly any novels until they started cutting open boxes that Dennis retrieved from a storage locker in El Paso. Out came the entire canon of Western literature, from ancient Greece and Rome to the best novelists, poets and essayists of the 1970s, nearly all in cheap, worn, paperback editions. “These are the books that he read in his 20s and 30s and maybe into his 40s, and he was broke that whole time,” said Dennis. “Once he got money, Cormac bought all his books in hardback if possible, and for the last 40 years of his life he read almost no fiction at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? The answer stems from McCarthy’s deeply disparaging view of modern society, which he considered lost, divorced from nature, history and tradition and heading toward social collapse and apocalypse. “Cormac considered contemporary fiction a waste of time,” said Dennis, “because contemporary writers no longer have a legitimate culture to feed their souls.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One afternoon, Dennis was marveling at McCarthy’s storytelling abilities and comedic talents, and I asked him if there was anything, apart from housekeeping, that his brother had been bad at. He thought about it for a moment and said, “Marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy was married and divorced three times. “His wives needed more than he gave them,” Dennis said. “The work always came first for Cormac. He loved those women, but he loved himself more. He was a narcissist. And if he hadn’t been a narcissist, he never would have achieved the same heights of artistic greatness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most enduring love of McCarthy’s life was a woman named Augusta Britt. As she revealed last year in interviews with Vanity Fair magazine, they began a sexual relationship when she was 17 and he was 43, and he took her to Mexico to evade the FBI, who were after him for statutory rape and Mann Act violations. Britt has said she didn’t feel sexually exploited and credits McCarthy for saving her life by rescuing her from an abusive situation in Tucson, but some readers and commentators have found McCarthy’s behavior with her beyond the pale. (Britt declined to comment for this piece.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy and Britt were together as a couple for about four years. Even after they split up, “He never stopped loving her,” Dennis said. “He continued to see her on a regular basis, and they maintained a close relationship for the rest of his life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piece by piece, the inscrutable mystique that McCarthy built around himself is falling away. Two biographies are on the way to publication, one by a friend of McCarthy’s named Laurence Gonzales, the other by literary biographer Tracy Daugherty, and Britt might collaborate on a book with Vincenzo Barney, who wrote her story in Vanity Fair. We also have McCarthy’s library, which perhaps more than any other source can illuminate the mind of the man who, as Peebles says, “built his life on books.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the first day of the final cataloging session, Peebles let out a hooting sound upon finding a dead bat at the bottom of a box. The downstairs of the house had been steadily accumulating dust for more than two years, since McCarthy’s death, and it was still crammed with books. The McCarthy scholars—Cormackians, as they call themselves—repacked the cataloged books, wrote the date and “Cataloged CMS” for Cormac McCarthy Society, and stacked them up wherever space could be found. The annotated books went into separate boxes marked “annotated” or were piled up on the pool table. The dead bat was left in the bottom of a book box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the project began, Peebles had hoped that all the books could be kept together in a single collection in some sort of Cormac McCarthy memorial building, but that wasn’t panning out. Dennis had arranged for the annotated books to join his brother’s papers, which include the notes and drafts for his entire body of work, at the Wittliff Collections archive at Texas State University. The Santa Fe Institute wanted a selection of the most intellectually rigorous academic books for a small library it was planning to build in honor of McCarthy. The rest of the books were going to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he enrolled twice and failed to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the digital realm, however, McCarthy’s library will live on as a complete entity, and the public will be able to inspect its cataloged titles free of charge. “Our goal, right from the outset, was to create an open-access database listing all the books in his collection,” Peebles said. “Anyone who wants to know what books McCarthy was reading, and whether he annotated them, will be able to log on and access that information.” The University of South Carolina Press has agreed to partner with Peebles to create a website for this purpose, and to publish a monograph by Peebles about the cataloging project. There’s talk of scanning all the annotations at some point and making them available on the website, but that is still theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year after the project began, Peebles opened the very last box. Perhaps the best adjective for its contents is Cormackian. Peebles pulled them out and announced books about Mexican architecture and the French Renaissance court, Kierkegaard’s metaphors and the Texas Rangers, the neurobiology of mental illness, architecture and society in Normandy from 1120 to 1270, and the Gun Digest book of assault weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She was unable to calculate the total number of books because the cataloging software didn’t account for multi-volume works. McCarthy’s 36-volume history of Utah, for example, registered as a single entry. Nor did the software tally multiple editions of the same book, so McCarthy’s 13 copies of Moby-Dick registered as one entry. The total number of entries was 18,520. Taking into account duplicate copies and multi-volume works, Peebles felt confident that McCarthy’s library contained just over 20,000 books, with 2,170 annotated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving away from the house, with the taste of old book dust in my mouth, I marveled at the extraordinary force of McCarthy’s curiosity. I thought about the books on acousto-optics and lay intellectuals in the ninth-century Carolingian Empire. The $2,200 he spent on eight volumes of Horace Walpole’s collected letters. The $10,000 in several uncashed royalty checks that he used as a bookmark in the memoir of William Faulkner’s niece. To peer into someone’s library is to peer into their brain, and here, it seemed, was a mind that wanted to know everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editors’ note: After the print version of this story was published, this version of the piece was updated with further comment from Dennis McCarthy. Also, on September 8, 2025, this article was updated with further details about the University of South Carolina Press’ involvement in this archival project.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;head&gt;v2.0.0 - Stable Release of Immich&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Welcome&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce the stable release of Immich! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This has been a journey long in the making. So much has changed since the first commit on the project, all the way back in February, 2022. The project and team continue to grow, and today we’re proud to announce &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For more specifics about the stable release, see our FAQs below.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Merch and DVD&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;To celebrate this release, we want to capture this moment in a nostalgic form, reminiscent of how software was distributed in our childhood - on a CD (or DVD, in this “case”). Introducing Immich Stable in physical form! You can find the link to the disk here&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The disk comes with a fully bootable Immich instance, featuring a selection of curated photos chosen by the team. You can purchase the disk from our merch store, along with a client or server product key, to support and celebrate this milestone with us.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The merch store is also updated with retro-styled Immich designs, check it out in https://immich.store&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Future plans&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Now that Immich is stable, here are some of the things that we will be focusing on:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Thank you&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We cannot thank you enough for the support over the past three years. Community participation, from the first comments on the original reddit post, to the feedback when we joined FUTO, have contributed to the awesome product Immich is today. Thank you for joining us and believing in our mission to regain control over your most precious data. Here’s to many more years!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We'll also be hosting a Q&amp;amp;A livestream tomorrow, October 2nd, 2025 at 6 PM UTC. You can submit your questions here and subscribe for notifications when the livestream starts here.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Immich Team&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Will there be a live stream?&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Yes. We'll be hosting a Q&amp;amp;A livestream tomorrow, October 2nd, 2025 at 6 PM UTC. You can submit your questions here and subscribe for notifications when the livestream starts here.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;Do I still need backups?&lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Yes! A 3-2-1 backup strategy is still crucial. The team has the responsibility to ensure that the application doesn’t cause loss of your precious memories; however, we cannot guarantee that hard drives will not fail, or an electrical event causes unexpected shutdown of your server/system, leading to data loss. Therefore, we still encourage users to follow best practices when safeguarding their data. Keep multiple copies of your most precious data: at least two local copies and one copy offsite in cold storage. Additionally, we are starting to work on a cloud backup service to make backups easier.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;When will &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I'm experiencing an upgrade problem after using the Docker &amp;amp; VectorChord instructions from https://docs.immich.app/install/upgrading. My previous version was 1.133&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Docker compose went without any issues, and ps shows healthy processes, but now I get a DNS error:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;docker ps -a shows&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Any pointers what I could do? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;There're just 3 little things that I think should be mandatory for a stable version of Immich:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I think that with these 3 things the release can really be considered a stable version 😊&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Judge in the Bits of Freedom vs. Meta lawsuit: Meta must respect users’ choice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;02 oktober 2025&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today the judge issued a ruling in the summary proceedings brought by digital human rights organisation Bits of Freedom against Meta. The organisation demanded that Meta gives its users on apps such as Instagram and Facebook the option to select a feed that is not based on profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bits of Freedom sued Meta for a breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA). This European legislation is intended to give users more autonomy and control over the major online platforms. One of the core elements of the DSA is that users must have greater influence over the information they see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many people, and especially for young people, social media platforms are a major source of news and information. Therefore it is crucial that users themselves can decide which content appears on their feed. Without that freedom of choice, participation in the public debate is seriously hampered. That is problematic at any time, but especially so during election periods. In the Netherlands, national elections will be held at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The judge states that Meta is indeed acting in violation of the law. He says that “a non‑persistent choice option for a recommendation system runs counter to the purpose of the DSA, which is to give users genuine autonomy, freedom of choice, and control over how information is presented to them.” The judge also concludes that the way Meta has designed its platforms constitutes “a significant disruption of the autonomy of Facebook and Instagram users.” The judge orders Meta to adjust its apps so that the user’s choice is preserved, even when the user navigates to another section or restarts the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We are pleased that the judge now makes clear that Meta must respect the user’s choice,” says Maartje Knaap, spokesperson for Bits of Freedom. “It is absolutely unacceptable that a handful of American tech billionaires determine how we see the world. That concentration of power poses a risk to our democracy. At the same time, it is regrettable that we need to go to court to ensure Meta complies with the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta has an interest in steering users toward a feed where it can show as many interest‑ and behavior‑based ads as possible. That is the core of Meta’s revenue model. Subtle design techniques push users toward that feed, while the non‑profiled feed is hidden behind a logo, making it hard to find. Users who do choose the alternative timeline also lose direct access to features such as Direct Messages. Moreover, when you open the app, it always starts with Meta’s feed, even if the user selected a different one before. Because of the judge’s ruling, Meta must change its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“This ruling shows that Meta is not untouchable,” continues Maartje Knaap. “But we are also realistic, this is just a drop in the ocean. There’s still a long way to go. We hope the decision will inspire individuals, civil society organisations, regulators and lawmakers worldwide around the world who are working to rein in Meta’s power. Together we can stand up to a company that has become overwhelmingly powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the ruling here (in Dutch).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An extortion group calling itself the Crimson Collective claims to have breached Red Hat's private GitHub repositories, stealing nearly 570GB of compressed data across 28,000 internal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data allegedly includes approximately 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), which can contain sensitive information about a customer's network and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A CER is a consulting document prepared for clients that often contains infrastructure details, configuration data, authentication tokens, and other information that could be abused to breach customer networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red Hat confirmed that it suffered a security incident related to its consulting business, but would not verify any of the attacker's claims regarding the stolen GitHub repositories and customer CERs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Red Hat is aware of reports regarding a security incident related to our consulting business and we have initiated necessary remediation steps," Red Hat told BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The security and integrity of our systems and the data entrusted to us are our highest priority. At this time, we have no reason to believe the security issue impacts any of our other Red Hat services or products and are highly confident in the integrity of our software supply chain."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Red Hat did not respond to any further questions about the breach, the hackers told BleepingComputer that the intrusion occurred approximately two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They allegedly found authentication tokens, full database URIs, and other private information in Red Hat code and CERs, which they claimed to use to gain access to downstream customer infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hacking group also published a complete directory listing of the allegedly stolen GitHub repositories and a list of CERs from 2020 through 2025 on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The directory listing of CERs include a wide range of sectors and well known organizations such as Bank of America, T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T, Fidelity, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Walmart, Costco, the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center, Federal Aviation Administration, the House of Representatives, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any information regarding this incident or any other undisclosed attacks, you can contact us confidentially via Signal at 646-961-3731 or at tips@bleepingcomputer.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hackers stated that they attempted to contact Red Hat with an extortion demand but received no response other than a templated reply instructing them to submit a vulnerability report to their security team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to them, the created ticket was repeatedly assigned to additional people, including Red Hat's legal and security staff members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BleepingComputer sent Red Hat additional questions, and we will update this story if we receive more information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same group also claimed responsibility for briefly defacing Nintendo’s topic page last week to include contact information and links to their Telegram channel&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every year, dozens of pirate site operators and their affiliates are arrested worldwide. Aside from highlighting the damage to rightsholders and the risks involved, little context is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The case against the Argentinian operator of Al Ángulo TV provides a welcome exception, with a rather unique plot twist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With assistance from top-tier Spanish football league LaLiga, on August 20 Argentinian police arrested Alejo Warles. The authorities accused the 25-year-old, known online as Shishi, of running a piracy operation that had amassed millions of monthly users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, it wasn’t just the authorities and rightsholders who commented publicly. Friends and family came out in support of Shishi, launching a fundraiser for his defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shishi’s attorney described the case as a “David versus Goliath” battle, a multinational company pitted against a young man with no prior criminal record, who lives with his grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sharing a Cell with Murderers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While most pirate site operators prefer to stay off the radar following an arrest, Alejo Warles enjoys the opposite. He previously ran a YouTube channel and has been very active on social media recently, so this doesn’t really come as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An excellent article by local news outlet El Entre Ríos, which deserves full credit, provides more detail about what happened after Warles’ arrest. Key commentary is provided by Warles himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Police started hammering on Warles’ door around 07:45 on the morning of August 20. After he was arrested and handcuffed, a lawyer from LaLiga bought Warles’ some yogurt before he was sent to the police station in Paraná.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day, Warles was transferred to the San Isidro Investigations headquarters with a police escort. “It was like they were bringing Pablo Escobar,” Warles notes, referring to the infamous drug lord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pirate site operator ended up in a cell with people accused of crimes that didn’t take place behind a keyboard. While that certainly made an impression, it wasn’t all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was there for a day and a half with murderers, thieves… But they were very kind to me. To cheer me up, they would say, ‘Another guy like you came in and got out after three hours’,” Warles said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bailed Out and Back Online&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After three days in custody, on Friday August 22 Warles was released on bail. The criminal investigation remains ongoing, and it’s likely that Warles will still have to defend himself in court. But for now, he’s glad to have regained his freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Warles was also free to pick up the X account of Al Ángulo TV, which had amassed thousands of new followers after his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m not going to reoffend with the websites, but I will continue working on social media,” he told El Entre Ríos. “When the police arrested me, I had 123,000 followers, and today that number has reached more than 138,000.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Seized Cryptocurrency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Warles has control over his social media accounts, the authorities still have his cell phone, computer, and other seized hardware, which are likely to be used as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When LaLiga announced the crackdown in August, it mentioned that virtual wallets and cryptocurrencies were also seized. These were presumably used to collect advertising revenue for Al Ángulo TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warles does not deny that he owned a crypto wallet. However, he notes that this was not a massive haul.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They accused me of profiteering but couldn’t prove anything. There were $263 in my virtual wallet,” Warles notes, adding that cryptocurrency wallets are pretty common for today’s youth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tech Unicorn Hires Piracy ‘GOAT’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While being arrested for alleged crimes is a scary prospect for many, Warles appears to be holding up well. In fact, the exposure helped to land him a new job at professional esports team 9z Globant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team is the result of a partnership between 9z Team and Argentinian tech unicorn Globant. Somewhat ironically, Globant previously worked with LaLiga to monitor the live-streaming user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warles welcomed himself to 9z Globant via the team’s social media account, referring to himself as an idol, genius, and GOAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lucía Quinteros, the main social media manager at the esports team, informed Entre Ríos that after considering their new hire’s history, they believe that he can add value to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We hired Alejo, not the person who set up that project (Al Ángulo TV). Of course, we evaluated what happened, but we believe that, from now on, Alejo can pursue a different career path,” Quinteros said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Warles himself, he was hired because he’s the best. Like many of his comments, this bravado should not be taken too seriously, but nevertheless sits in stark contrast to the typical pirate site operator facing criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;EU funds are flowing into spyware companies, and politicians are demanding answers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experts say Commission is ‘fanning the flames’ of the continent’s own Watergate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An arsenal of angry European Parliament members (MEPs) is demanding answers from senior commissioners about why EU subsidies are ending up in the pockets of spyware companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The group of 39 politicians referred to recent investigations that revealed countries such as Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Spain have funnelled millions of taxpayer euros at a time to help support commercial spyware-makers' finances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They wrote: "According to these findings, entities such as Intellexa, Cy4Gate, Verint and Cognyte – whose technologies have been linked to unlawful surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders and political actors in the EU, as well as in third countries with dreadful human rights records – have benefitted from public financing, including EU programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This raises serious questions about the governance, transparency, and accountability of the Union's funding mechanisms. In the light of the scandals uncovered in Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary, and Spain, among others, and of the recommendations of the PEGA inquiry, it is deeply troubling that the Union is directly or indirectly enabling tools that erode democracy, fundamental rights, and the rule of law."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MEPs cited investigative journalism from Follow The Money, which revealed in September that institutions such as Spain's public-funded Centre for the Development Of Industrial Technology (CDTI) handed over €1.3 million (c $1.5 million) to now-shuttered spyware peddler Mollitiam Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, Italy's state-owned bank, Mediocredito Centrale, was found to have acted as a guarantor to a €2.5 million (c $2.9 million) loan to Dataflow Security, an Italy-based commercial spyware developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FTM said that it did not prove that any of the money, in any of the cases it found, was used to directly fund spyware development, although funding was provided in several instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The letter addressed to senior commissioners Henna Virkkunen (Finland), Michael McGrath (Ireland), and Piotr Serafin (Poland) – who oversee tech, justice, and anti-fraud respectively – requested greater transparency over how EU funds were distributed, among other matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Various questions were raised by the MEPs, such as how the European Commission verifies the integrity of the entities that receive EU funds, whether any risk assessments are carried out before investments are made to spyware companies, and how much money in total has been awarded to these organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also asked for answers on how the Commission plans to ensure its funding mechanisms align with its stances on matters such as human rights and digital resilience, and why it has not implemented the recommendations made by the PEGA inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Register approached the European Commission for a response to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, the PEGA inquiry was launched in 2022 following reports of several EU governments using NSO Group's Pegasus spyware a year earlier, and three years after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results were published in 2023, branding the pervasive spyware use "Europe's Watergate" and a "severe violation of all the values of the European Union."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report stated: "The spyware scandal is not a series of isolated national cases of abuse, but a full-blown European affair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"EU Member State governments have been using spyware on their citizens for political purposes and to cover up corruption and criminal activity. Some went even further and embedded spyware in a system deliberately designed for authoritarian rule."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the main recommendations made by the PEGA committee were to restrict law enforcement's use of spyware only to exceptional cases, protect sensitive targets like politicians, lawyers, and doctors, and to set the conditions for legal use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 39 MEPs asked the European Commission to additionally commit to launching an immediate public review of EU subsidies flowing into spyware companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that review, the politicians specifically requested details on all funds issued and awarded to spyware companies since 2015, a commitment to excluding all spyware vendors from future EU funding instruments, and a follow-up on the PEGA recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Citizens of the Union have the right to know whether their taxes are being used to finance technologies that endanger their fundamental rights," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Who watches the watchmen? Surveillanceware firms make bank, avoid oversight&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As Members of the European Parliament, we expect your full cooperation in ensuring accountability and restoring public trust."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebecca White, researcher and advisor on targeted surveillance at Amnesty Tech's Security Lab, said she and Amnesty support the letter, and highlighted the Commission's lack of communication on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She told The Register: "At Amnesty, we've documented for many years how spyware has enabled human rights abuses in Europe and beyond, and how the surveillance industry is under-regulated and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The European Commission has remained silent. These latest allegations should alarm all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They suggest that not only is the EU failing to put out the fire, they're fanning the flames. We welcome this collective call for transparency and explanations – the Commission can no longer wash its hands of Europe's complicity in the spyware crisis, which is fuelling human rights abuses across the world."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aljosa Ajanovic Andelic, policy advisor at European Digital Rights (EDRi), echoed the MEPs' request for a ban on spyware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said: "The lack of action by the Commission when it comes to spyware is appalling and dangerous. In fact, not only have they not done anything to stop the proliferation of shady spyware vendors in the EU, they actually used EU taxpayers' money to directly fund the industry. This has to stop, and we are calling for a full ban on commercial spyware in the EU."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As the largest digital rights network in Europe, our position is firm: the use of spyware is inherently incompatible with fundamental rights, and therefore should be banned, as well as the market of private companies that are profiting from human rights violations." ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Meta will listen into AI conversations to personalize ads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Religion, race, health and other dicey topics supposedly exempt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta, having committed hundreds of billions to AI infrastructure and talent, says it will start using people's conversations and interactions with its AI services to create personalized content and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This applies to Meta AI, the company's web-based chat interface, and apps that integrate Meta AI, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta intends to begin using people's text exchanges and voice conversations with its AI service to generate personalized posts, reels, and other attention lures starting on December 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page," the company explained in its announcement. "As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A notification campaign about the change begins October 7, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no opt-out, but Meta has spared those who live in the EU, the UK, and South Korea for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The social networking giant and metaverse money-burner will let users make some adjustments to its slop-gavage loop with its Ads Preferences and feed customization controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta insists it won't personalize ads based on conversations that touch on religion, sexual orientation, politics, health, race, ethnicity, philosophical belief, or trade union membership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That list of untouchable topics suggests canny Meta users could stymie the personalization plan by prefixing every interaction with a suitably sensitive term – for example, start every interaction with "Pray tell..." or “Oh, Lord, Meta really thought this was a good idea?”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Nadella hands Microsoft money machine off to new commercial CEO so he can visioneer the future&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stargate, schmargate. We're spending $60B+ on AI this year, Meta's Zuckerberg boasts&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Known as Facebook until brand damage from incessant privacy scandals inspired a name change in 2021, Meta was notionally focused on the metaverse – an ill-defined term for immersive digital experiences that may or may not involve goggles. Having spent something like $60 billion on its Reality Labs group without much to show for it (apart from the privacy-invading Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses), Meta lately has taken to talking up AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month told President Trump that Meta plans to invest $600 billion on AI investment through 2028 – and surely that will happen because Zuckerberg said it, even if other massive AI spending projects like Stargate’s promised $500 billion AI infrastructure investments don’t quite add up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta's interest in AI, however, is really about ads – using AI to encourage exposure to and engagement with ads, some of which may be generated by AI. The company has already said AI has helped boost engagement with ads posted to its platforms. Execs also see AI as making it easier to advertisers to create and manage campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted by the UK's Open Rights Group, 98 percent of Meta’s $165 billion of revenue in 2024 came from advertising, resulting in net income of $62.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iesha White, director of intelligence for marketing watchdog Check My Ads, told The Register in an email that several AI companies like Perplexity and OpenAI have integrated advertising into their AI products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But this is different – Meta’s core business is monetizing ad space across its owned and operated sites and apps, in addition to ad placements on external publisher partnerships via its Facebook Audience Network product," said White. "By harvesting data from its AI chats across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, Meta gains yet another closed-loop data source, meaning Meta could reduce transparency of the targeting inputs across its advertising products, in the name of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It also provides an opportunity for Meta to further shape and obfuscate its attribution models using its own source of truth, with brands unable to independently audit a campaign’s true effectiveness."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta coincidentally is fighting a $7 billion class action lawsuit [PDF] brought by advertisers who claim that Meta fraudulently represented the potential reach of its ads by citing user accounts rather than actual people – a charge Meta disputes. ®&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hey everyone &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We’re super excited to share that starting with v1.113 we’re rolling out data tables (beta) to all plans. &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since the very beginning of n8n we’ve heard many of you mention the need for a proper table inside n8n to store data between workflow executions without needing to switch platforms or setting up credentials and now it’s finally here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With data tables you can:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Save specific data from your workflow runs&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Keep data around between multiple executions&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avoid duplicate runs by tracking execution status&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Store reusable prompts for different workflows&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Collect evaluation data for your AI workflows&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Do lookups, merges, enhancements…&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;…and honestly, probably 100 other creative things we haven’t even thought of yet &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; To make sure your instance stays performant, we’ve set a 50MB limit for everyone. If you’re self-hosting (and know what you’re doing), you can change that via the ENV variable &lt;code&gt;N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; Upgrade to 1.113, give data tables a spin, and let us know what you think! What’s missing? What would make it even more useful for you? We’re really curious to hear your ideas and thoughts! &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is absolutely awesome to see, I can’t wait to use these! It’s probably been my number one frustration that saving even a small amount of data between executions for all sorts of purposes requires either integrating PostgreSQL and dealing with schemas, using a third party database or API like Supabase (as handy as they are), or using variables that are powerful but are somewhat clumsy to instantiate and track since they only work in Code nodes and only save data for production executions, making testing hard. Hoping data-tables makes a ton of these things easier! Probably won’t run the new version until it’s in final release rather than pre-release, but this is awesome to see!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is really great - when I migrated from “the other platform” almost 4 years ago, I really felt the pain of not having a simple in-app data storage. I played around with Data tables this weekend and it’s just SUCH a good and fast experience! Kudos to our Product and Engineering teams &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: There is an issue with very large SQLite databases that is causing instances to slow down. Out of an abundance of caution, we are unfortunately removing version 1.113.0 until we fix this issue. We hope to have this released again with a fix within the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It´d be cool for self hosting to be able to add a second DB, where n8n pulls the data from. So one could have performance without having to set up each time a postgres connection.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Very happy to see this feature. I’ve been testing it out, and was commenting feedback on Reddit but someone in the Discord server said the forums is the best place to post this instead. Here’s my list(so far)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When going to the Data Tables tab, “Create Table” is not default on the upper right button, it’s defaulted to “Create Workflow” instead.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cannot change the data type after a column is created.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cannot set any of the column’s as primary or unique such as the ID column (To prevent duplicates)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For some odd reason, setting a column data type to “number” then pushing data from JSON array into the table, physically opening the table and looking at the rows, the numbers in the “number” data type column are not all together. For example “29683389” shows in the table as “29 683 389”. This isn’t a one off either, ALL rows exhibit the same behavior and ALL columns set as “numbers” too.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Table page can only show 50 rows per page. Which I understand is probably for performance reasons. However, there really needs to be a “search” function for the table to search for data.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Are there any limitations for creating tables?&lt;lb/&gt; or we can create multiples/unlimited (in 50Mb limit)?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Love this list @compaholic, thanks so much for sharing it.&lt;lb/&gt; 1, 2 and 5 are all planned. For (4), I think that is just a highlighting to make it easier to read that it’s actually 29M. So the number should still be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;TOLLESON, AZ — The Tolleson Police Department is investigating after two Amazon delivery drones crashed on Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officials say they are working an active investigation after the two drones crashed into a crane that was in a commercial area near 96th Avenue and Roosevelt Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's unclear if anyone was injured during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ABC15 reached out to Amazon which provided the following statement: “We’re aware of an incident involving two Prime Air drones in Tolleson, Arizona. We’re currently working with the relevant authorities to investigate.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For 16+ years, we master the rules of school. Study hard, get good grades, follow the formula and ultimately merit wins. Then we enter the workforce and none of it works quite like we thought. This becomes painfully obvious as you rise higher in the org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even seasoned veterans forget this. Recently, a director-level client hit a minor career bump and spiraled into crisis mode, their expectations still anchored in what I call "school rules".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations don't run purely on merit or even clear criteria. Although they claim otherwise using buzzwords like “merit” and “data”. That’s only one part of the story, and also what’s visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other part, often more consequential, runs on flawed psychology, imperfect decisions, and competing interests. You can call it organizational absurdities. Or more bluntly, institutional stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What follows is a reality check. It’s a “letter to frustrated high-performers” who keep bumping up against these unwritten rules of work. Consider it your guide to staying sane while playing the long game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you have to, blame stupidity not malice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Organizations are anything but meritocracies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perception matters as much as performance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t waste time fighting for “objective fairness.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Positioning what you offer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mind the gap: your standards vs their’s&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Higher you go, more it’s an inverted funnel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Know which game you’re choosing to play&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Watching your circle of control&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep a balanced portfolio&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;If you have to, blame stupidity not malice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of what we chalk up to “politics” or “backstabbing”, aka bad intent, is often better explained by stupidity, inertia, bad incentives, fragmented attention, and misaligned maps of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are juggling too much, thinking too little, and rarely stepping back to ask, “What actually makes sense here?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you assume stupidity instead of malice, you stay above the fray, stop taking slights personally, or turning misjudgments into betrayals. This way we retain agency and choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming malice turns you into a cynic. In contrast, assuming stupidity keeps you curious. Instead of fighting ghosts, you study the system and ask better questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What pressures is that person responding to?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What game are they trying to win?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What am I assuming as rational that’s not?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one is out to get you; they’re just out to get through the week. The shift from malice to stupidity gives you just enough distance to be curious instead of reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Organizations are anything but meritocracies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Managers will claim they are, and we want to believe them. But the reality is that the best don’t always rise. At least not as easily or automatically as we think they should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes they do. But often, what gets rewarded isn’t performance but proximity to power, timing, perception, and political usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean performance doesn’t matter. It means performance is necessary but not sufficient. It is the entry ticket that gets you through the door, but does not guarantee a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming that excellence is obvious is the fatal error of the conscientious expert. Although it creates value, performance doesn’t automatically generate visibility, influence, or narrative. And those are the currencies that get traded when decisions are made by humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Merit matters, but it needs a stage and a spotlight. It doesn’t mean becoming a shameless self-promoter. Rather, your work needs a distribution strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Perception matters as much as performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In school, everyone was evaluated against an objective criteria by someone paid to assess fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In organizations, no such thing exists. Instead, perception is the “data”. And this data is constructed often haphazardly by busy people working off limited inputs. You have to manage the story by shaping impressions intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only does perception matter as much as performance but who’s doing the perceiving matters even more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all perceivers are created equal. A peer may love your work but they might not be a critical node in the web of influence. Who gets consulted? Do they know what you’ve built, and have they heard your name in relevant contexts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just “do great work.”; it’s also “do the work that’s perceived as valuable.” This means translating your work’s significance up the chain and shape its interpretation. If not, others will do it for you and they may not be generous, or even accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more, see my last two articles: Schrodinger’s Cat at Work Part I and Schrodinger’s Cat at Work Part II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t waste time fighting for “objective fairness.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, organizations love metrics: KPIs, OKRs, dashboards. They create the appearance of detached objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, subjective decisions are constantly happening behind the scenes. The decisions about who to trust, or who gets a shot are made through informal reputations and shared stories about your value. Then the “data” is used to justify them in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than rant against the system, get good at reading the underlying subjective logic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Who does this person trust, and why?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What do they consider strategic vs tactical?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What would make them feel safe betting on me?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subjectivity isn’t the enemy. It’s the underlying physics of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Positioning what you offer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have had the right message but at the wrong moment, or in the wrong wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Positioning is the context around your contributions: Why now? Why you? Why this way? A good idea, or stellar performance, poorly positioned can seem irrelevant. In contrast, a mediocre one nicely positioned is deemed visionary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just what you say but also when, how, and through whom you say it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persistence matters as well. Think in campaigns, not just one-time efforts. In my piece on effective conversations I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;It is the series of messages in different forms that over time makes the difference. More akin to waves shaping the shoreline rather than the occasional once in a lifetime tsunami.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What messages are you sending, are they varied, and are you doing it consistently? This is as true for marketing products as it is for positioning yourself inside organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mind the gap: your standards vs their’s&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another obvious but forgotten reality of organizational life: Not everyone operates by the same playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You prioritize substance and direct contribution, while others focus on visibility and relationship-building in ways that are uncomfortable to you. It’s that colleague who excels at positioning routine work as “strategic”, or the peer who builds influence through cultivating key relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, these approaches do yield results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t mean dismissing it as pure politics or simply abandoning your principles. It means understanding the landscape you're operating in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t effectively participate in a game you refuse to see clearly. You're not at a disadvantage because you choose to act with integrity. It’s because you fail to recognize that influence flows through multiple channels and others are willing to play differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key is not to match their behavior but to factor it in. Instead of expecting fairness, anticipate asymmetry. And then get creative about how you play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being ethical doesn’t mean being passive but tactically awake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Higher you go, more it’s an inverted funnel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious point but also easy to forget especially if your career has been on autopilot so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a bottleneck up top: fewer seats, more ambiguity, less structure and high subjectivity. It’s not just hard to get in but even harder to stay clear on what “good” even looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means you can do everything right and still get passed over. That’s not a verdict on your worth or ability, just geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also means that staying the course when things don’t go your way isn’t just a virtue but a practice. To play the long game, you have to keep showing up even after crushing disappointment without getting cynical of the process. Put differently, you need high levels of frustration tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cliched? Yes, very much so, but also uncommon. It means if you can pull it off, it’s a source of power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Know which game you’re choosing to play&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no one game being played. There are multiple, overlapping games with different scoring systems. Some are playing to build long-term credibility; others for short-term visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t play them all and neither should you try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real problem is we slide into playing someone else's game without realizing it. We adopt the norms and metrics of others without checking if that’s the game we actually want to play, let alone win. So we end up optimizing for a role we don’t respect, or chasing promotions that hollow us out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever you’re doing, own it outright. Not just the upside but also the downside. If you're focused on building something lasting like developing others, or robust systems, you need to accept that visible status markers (titles, promotions, recognition) might not happen right away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The danger isn't which path you pick, whether it's chasing promotions or maintaining your autonomy. The real disaster is to sleepwalk down a path while pretending you had no choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Watching your circle of control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An easy way to burn out is to focus relentlessly on things you care about but cannot actually influence. Over time, especially in large organizations, it's tempting to attribute everything to forces outside yourself. This induces organizational helplessness. A sense that nothing you do matters unless someone above says so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fight that, not with bluster, but with deliberate ownership of the space you control and influence. While experienced professionals often have more influence than they think, it's distributed differently than they expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key is maintaining an internal locus of control which includes your positioning, relationships, and what you are building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keep a balanced portfolio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a well-understood concept in investing but often missing in the context of long careers. If all your identity is wrapped up in organizational validation, you're fragile. This means setbacks don't just rattle your job, it rattles your sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many mid-career professionals learn this the hard way. To state the obvious: you are not your title, or your most recent performance review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The anti-dote is diversification not of money, but meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebalancing here means investing in other sources of connection and community. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developing a craft that exists beyond a given employer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Investing in communities that outlast org charts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Projects, relationships, and sources of learning that replenish.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are building adaptive capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A balanced portfolio also helps to play the long game with more psychological courage because your whole life isn't riding on the next promotion cycle or external validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In closing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By recognizing the subjective currents that shape work environments, we can operate within them more skillfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't cynicism or gaming the system. Rather, it's developing a nuanced understanding of how organizations actually function. This stance equips us to make more intentional choices about how to engage, contribute, and create meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As ideal as it sounds, the goal isn't to eliminate organizational absurdities, but to work effectively within and around them. By staying in the game, you find ways to gradually improve the system from within.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations are ultimately human constructs. Imperfect, but not immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Autism should not be viewed as a single condition with a unified underlying cause, according to scientists who found that those diagnosed early in childhood typically have a distinct genetic profile to those diagnosed later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The international study, based on genetic data from more than 45,000 autistic people in Europe and the US, showed that those diagnosed in early childhood, typically before six years old, were more likely to show behavioural difficulties from early childhood, including problems with social interaction, but remain stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those diagnosed with autism later, typically after the age of 10, were more likely to experience increasing social and behavioural difficulties during adolescence and also had an increased likelihood of mental health conditions such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The term ‘autism’ likely describes multiple conditions,” said Dr Varun Warrier, from Cambridge’s department of psychiatry, senior author of the research. “For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scientists are not advocating for a move towards two diagnostic categories, saying that this could be unhelpful for the many who fall somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is a gradient,” said Warrier. “There are also many other factors that contribute to age of diagnosis, so the moment you go from averages to anything that is applicable to an individual, it’s false equivalency.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings come at a time when autism diagnosis has risen steeply, with a nearly 800% increase in diagnoses in the UK between 1998 and 2018. Experts say this is due largely to a widening of the diagnostic criteria and greater recognition of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, while autism is defined by having challenges with social communication, sensory processing and restrictive behaviours, there is huge variability in how these difficulties present between individuals. Scientists have been looking at whether the population clusters into subgroups, with shared traits or trajectories, that could make studying autism more tractable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest study used behavioural data from four birth cohorts, ranging from 89 to 188 people, and genetic data from two large studies, with more than 45,000 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, it was generally assumed that those diagnosed earlier tended to be those with more marked autistic traits, underpinned by people carrying a higher proportion of autism-linked gene variants. However, the latest study revealed a different pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis, published in Nature, found that the underlying genetic profiles differed between those diagnosed with autism earlier and later in life, with only a modest overlap. The average genetic profile of later-diagnosed autism is closer to that of ADHD, as well as to mental health conditions such as depression and PTSD, than it is to autism diagnosed in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those diagnosed before the age of six years were more likely to be slow to walk and have difficulty interpreting hand gestures and tended to experience social and communication difficulties that appeared early but remained stable. Those diagnosed after the age of 10 years were more likely to experience an increase in difficulties during adolescence and, by late adolescence, presented with more severe challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prof Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, who was not involved in the research, said: “It makes me hopeful that even more subgroups will come to light, and each will find an appropriate diagnostic label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is time to realise that ‘autism’ has become a ragbag of different conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Europe’s richest man, the luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, has said that a wealth tax that could cost him more than €1bn (£817m) would be deadly for France’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The French founder of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said in a statement to the Sunday Times that calls for a 2% wealth tax on all assets “aims to destroy the liberal economy, the only one that works for the good of all”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of a wealth tax has steadily gained ground in France because of a political crisis, with the government trying to push through unpopular budget cuts. The idea of a 2% wealth tax on fortunes worth more than €100m has been proposed by Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor who has become a household name in France.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The economist argues that the tax – named the Zucman tax by others – could help France with its squeezed budget. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, this month appointed a new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, after the centrist François Bayrou failed to win support for an austerity budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arnault – previously the world’s richest man – claimed that a 2% wealth tax would be an “offensive, which is deadly for our economy”. He also said he was “certainly the largest individual taxpayer and one of the largest professional taxpayers through the companies I run” in France.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arnault’s net worth stood at $169bn (£125bn) on Friday, mainly because of his 48% stake in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, according to Bloomberg. After joining his family company and turning it from construction to property, Arnault grew his fortune by buying up brands ranging from the jewellers Bulgari and Tiffany &amp;amp; Co, the fashion houses Christian Dior and Celine, to perfumes and whiskey brand Glenmorangie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arnault, who lives in Paris, sparked a French national debate over tax in 2012 when he sought Belgian citizenship. However, in April 2013, he withdrew his application as “a gesture of my attachment to France and my faith in its future”, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zucman is a professor of economics at the Paris School of Economics and the École normale supérieure, and last year wrote a prominent study on the wealth tax for the G20. In June, Zucman wrote in the Guardian: “Unprecedented wealth concentration – and the unbridled power that comes with such wealth – has distorted our democracy and is driving societal and economic tensions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wealth tax could raise as much as €20bn, according to Zucman. However, other economists have argued that it would raise only €5bn if the ultra-wealthy leave France.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is clearly not a technical or economic debate, but rather a clearly stated desire to destroy the French economy,” Arnault’s statement said. “I cannot believe that the French political forces that govern or have governed the country in the past could lend any credibility to this offensive, which is deadly for our economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DHH Is Way Worse Than I Thought&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever known someone who seemed nice enough and perfectly normal, until you saw one of their social media accounts and realized they were insane? Like, you became Facebook friends with your uncle, or followed that friend-of-a-friend who’s fun at parties on Instagram, and it turns out they constantly post about weird shit like the deep state and demographic replacement and the pedophile ring that Hillary Clinton definitely runs from the basement of a pizza parlor?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple weeks, the tech community has been slowly coming to terms with a prominent person like that. He seems congenial — started a successful open source project, co-founded a reputable company — until you come across his blog filled with unhinged political diatribes. I’m speaking, of course, of DHH: Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you, like me, don’t pay much attention to this person, the last thing you might remember him from is the fracas a few years ago over his company Basecamp banning political discussions at work. While I had my opinions about that What Counts as Politics in the Workplace? | jakelazaroff.com Basecamp says that "work is not an appropriate place to debate political issues". The problem is that the people on the other side aren’’t actually calling for debate. So let’s see if we can bridge the gap. What, exactly, counts as politics in the workplace? jakelazaroff.com/words/what-counts-as-politics-in-the-workplace/ , it seemed to fit within the general range of politics you can expect from most people. I assumed David was just a normal guy with whom I had some political differences, and went on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That all changed when I heard about the recent hostile takeover of the RubyGems package manager Shopify, pulling strings at Ruby Central, forces Bundler and RubyGems takeover Ruby Central recently took over a collection of open source projects from their maintainers without their consent. joel.drapper.me/p/rubygems-takeover/ , which appears to have started over a lost sponsorship for giving David a conference speaking slot. My interest was piqued, so I checked out his recent post “As I remember London As I remember London As soon as I was old enough to travel on my own, London was where I wanted to go. Compared to Copenhagen at the time, there was something so majestic about Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, and even the Tube around the turn of the millenium. Not just because their capital is twice as old as ours, but because it endured twice as much, through ... web.archive.org/web/20250925050154/https://world.hey.com/dhh/as-i-remember-london-e7d38e64 ”. By the time I finished reading, my jaw was on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHH’s politics are not normal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe they used to be, I don’t know, but as of right now the dude is way the fuck outside of what most people would consider moral or acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But don’t take my word for it. We can get it straight from the horse’s mouth. Let’s go through David’s “As I remember London” post and see exactly what he’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Native Brits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David’s post starts off fairly anodyne:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As soon as I was old enough to travel on my own, London was where I wanted to go. Compared to Copenhagen at the time, there was something so majestic about Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, and even the Tube around the turn of the millenium. Not just because their capital is twice as old as ours, but because it endured twice as much, through the Blitz and the rest of it, yet never lost its nerve. I thought I might move there one day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, man. I have cousins not too far away from there, so even though I live across the pond I’ve been lucky enough to visit a few times. London is great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That was then. Now, I wouldn’t dream of it. London is no longer the city I was infatuated with in the late ’90s and early 2000s. Chiefly because it’s no longer full of native Brits. In 2000, more than sixty percent of the city were native Brits. By 2024, that had dropped to about a third. A statistic as evident as day when you walk the streets of London now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The honeymoon is over: Big Ben and Trafalgar Square are only majestic if enough passersby are “native Brits”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a little vague, but he links “native Brits” to a Wikipedia article called “Ethnic groups in London Ethnic groups in London - Wikipedia en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London ” so we can see exactly whom he’s talking about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Greater London had a population of 8,899,375 at the 2021 census. Around 41% of its population were born outside the UK, and over 300 languages are spoken in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;59% of Londoners were born in the UK! How could it possibly be that only a third of them are native Brits?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The article’s first section breaks down the demographic data in a table. The first ethnicity listed? “White British” at 36.8% as of the 2021 census.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for other ethnic groups: the table rolls up “Asian or Asian British” at 20.8%, “Black or Black British” at 13.5%, “Mixed or British Mixed” at 5.7% and “Other” at 6.3%.1 No other group is even remotely close to a third.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that when DHH says “native Brits”, he’s specifically referring to white Brits. That’s why it’s “a statistic as clear as day when you walk the streets of London”: it’s his coy way of saying that too many of the 59% of Londoners born and raised in the UK are not white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if David means “white Brits”, why doesn’t he just say that? Why bother with the innuendo?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because complaining that there aren’t enough white people sounds weird and racist! David bristles at that label, but there’s a reason he’s hiding behind euphemisms rather than just saying what he means. Most people don’t go around thinking “boy, all these Black and Asian people make this city so much worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people, that is, except for David:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But I think, what would Copenhagen feel like, if only a third of it was Danish, like London? It would feel completely foreign, of course. Alien, even. So I get the frustration that many Brits have with the way mass immigration has changed the culture and makeup of not just London, but their whole country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He thinks that a city that has too many Black people feels “completely foreign”. That it’s “alien” to see too many Asian people as he walks the streets. David tries to throw “mass immigration” in there — but as we know, his problem with the “culture and makeup” is how many people are not white, whether or not they’re immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unite the Kingdom&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David continues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That frustration was on wide display in Tommy Robinson’s march yesterday. British and English flags flying high and proud, like they would in Copenhagen on the day of a national soccer match. Which was both odd to see but also heartwarming. You can sometimes be forgiven for thinking that all of Britain is lost in self-loathing, shame, and suicidal empathy. But of course it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who’s Tommy Robinson? According to his Wikipedia entry Tommy Robinson - Wikipedia en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson , he’s an “anti-Islam campaigner and one of the UK’s most prominent far-right activists with a history of criminal convictions”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a great start! But maybe Wikipedia just has a left wing bias?2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;He’s described himself — verbatim — as opposed to Islam PEGIDA U.K.: What Does The 'Anti-Islam' Group Want? The German protest movement is expanding across Europe www.newsweek.com/tommy-robinson-edl-pegida-uk-423623 .&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;He promised to retaliate against — also verbatim — every single Muslim in response to a terrorist attack Tommy Robinson is a far-right, Islamophobic extremist. Here’s why. — HOPE not hate In the last few weeks, former English Defence League (EDL) leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (alias Tommy Robinson), has started a crusade to confront journalists and bloggers... hopenothate.org.uk/2017/05/22/tommy-robinson-far-right-islamophobic-extremist/ .&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just Britain that is being invaded, it’s not just Britain that is being raped. Every single Western nation faces the same problem: an orchestrated, organised invasion and replacement of European citizens is happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That one’s Tommy Robinson himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Dutch far-right commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek delivered one of the day’s most incendiary speeches, appearing in a t-shirt emblazoned with the words “Generation Remigration”. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“They are demanding the sacrifice of our children on the altar of mass migration. Let’s not beat about the bush — this is the rape, replacement, and murder of our people… Remigration is possible, and it’s up to us to make it happen. We are Generation Remigration.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had to look up the word “remigration”. It means “ethnic cleansing via the mass deportation of non-white immigrants and their descendants, sometimes including those born in Europe, to their place of racial ancestry” Remigration - Wikipedia en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remigration .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“This is a religious war,” said Brian Tamaki, leader of New Zealand’s Destiny Church. “Islam, Hinduism, Baháʼí, Buddhism — whatever else you’re into — they’re all false. We’ve got to clean our countries up. Get rid of everything that doesn’t receive Jesus Christ. Ban any public expression of other religions in our Christian nations. Ban halal. Ban burqas. Ban mosques, temples, shrines — we don’t want those in our countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean… these people are clearly deranged, right? You’d think any of this would warrant at least a passing mention, but for some reason David doesn’t include a single quote about what the people at this “heartwarming” march actually said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David is well aware that these people are extremists. That’s why he tries to preempt that accusation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The easy way out of this uncomfortably large gathering of perfectly normal, peaceful Brits who’ve had enough is to tar them all as “far right”. That’s not just a British tactic, but one used across Europe, and previously in the US as well. It used to work very well, because the historical stigma was so strong, but, like hurling “nazi” and “fascist” at the most middle-of-the-road political figures and positions, it’s finally lost its power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that David never actually addresses the “far right” label on its merits — he just pivots to calling it overused, trying to direct your attention elsewhere like a magician distracting the audience as he performs a trick. We are meant to believe him that because people sometimes use “far right” and “nazi” and “fascist” too liberally, that must be happening here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But of course, that’s not what’s happening here. Calling these people far right is “easy” for the same reason it’s “easy” to say Joe Biden is liberal: it’s obviously true! These are not “middle-of-the-road” positions — they’re literally calling to ban non-Christian religions and to ethnically cleanse non-white citizens. It takes no stretch of the imagination to figure out why these people are far right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Demographic Replacement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you wanted to trick me into believing a conspiracy theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’d have to start with a grain of truth, right? You can’t come out of the gate with the COVID vaccine nano-chips that Bill Gates uses to track us through the 5G cell towers.3 That’d scare me off!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, the first step is to find some common ground. Something we can both agree on. Then you can slowly mix in the crazy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That in mind, let’s continue with David’s post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I really feel for the Brits because it’s not obvious how they get themselves out of this pickle. They’re still reeling from the Pakistani rape gangs that were left free to terrorize cities like Rotherham and Rochdale for years on end with horror-movie-like scenes of the most despicable, depraved abuse of British girls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The child sexual abuse scandals were real and horrible. The perpetrators were mostly British-Pakistani, and the victims were largely white. No one is disputing that; it’s the grain of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But like any good con artist, David has mixed in some other not-quite-so-true things he wants you to believe as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one: David really wants to make sure you know that the perpetrators were largely Pakistani: scary brown foreigners. He’s insinuating that there’s some connection between their ethnicity and sexually abusing children. It’s not just that many of these abusers happened to be Pakistani; David’s implying they did it because they were Pakistani. (Many of them were also British — but as we know by now, in David’s eyes that only counts if you’re white.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the victims, though, David brings out the dog whistles. He describes them as “British girls” (read: white). “Barbaric outsiders preying upon innocent white women” is a classic racist trope that would be perfectly at home in the Jim Crow South The Brute Caricature - Jim Crow Museum jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/brute/homepage.htm or Nazi Germany The Jewish Man and the Aryan Woman in Nazi Propaganda It is well-established that Nazi propaganda was rife with anti-Jewish racism. Propagandists projected racial differences onto the Jewish man www.epoch-magazine.com/post/the-jewish-man-and-the-aryan-woman-in-nazi-propaganda .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I don’t know. But I’m glad that there clearly are many Brits who are determined to find out. Unwilling to just let their society wither away while their bobbies chase bad tweets instead of the rampant street thefts or those barbaric rape gangs. Unwilling to resign the rest of the country to the kind of demographic replacement that befell London over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of the “barbaric rape gangs”, David also brings up “rampant street thefts” — suggesting that the same scary brown foreigners are responsible. The problem is that his implication is only backed up by bigotry. The source he links to about the street thefts London sees record 116,000 phone thefts in 2024 - equivalent to 13 an HOUR Campaigners say ‘we are in the midst of a phone theft epidemic’ www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/mobile-phone-theft-london-met-police-b1244212.html , for example, never mentions race or ethnicity. And in spite of the salacious rape gangs story, data show that non-white people in the UK are ever-so-slightly less likely to commit child sexual abuse Trends in official data | CSA Centre Our 2023/24 report providing new analysis of the latest data from statutory services on the identification and response to child sexual abuse in England &amp;amp; Wales. www.csacentre.org.uk/research-resources/research-evidence/scale-nature-of-abuse/trends-in-official-data/ .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After planting the grain of truth and making lurid insinuations, David finally gets to the crazy stuff. “Demographic replacement”: a reference to a debunked conspiracy theory that there’s a plot to replace white people in Western society What is ‘great replacement theory’ and how does it fuel racist violence? Investigators are still piecing together the motives of the mass shooter who killed 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, this weekend. But authorities aren't hesitating to call it a racially motivated attack. www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-is-great-replacement-theory-and-how-does-it-fuel-racist-violence . It’s the same thing that motivated the deadly Charlottesville Unite the Right4 march’s infamous chant: “you will not replace us! Unite the Right Rallies August 12, 2017 marks the deadly Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, VA, an event that brought the threat of domestic extremism into sharp focus. www.adl.org/unite-right-rallies ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;“Far Right”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David ends with a quote from Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of the Social Democrats. Someone, he says, that “nobody could credibly charge with being ‘far right’”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are really a lot of us Danes who believed that when people came to this ‘world’s best country’ and were given such good opportunities, they would integrate. They would become Danish, and they would never, ever harm our society. All of us who thought that way have been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how moderate her words are compared to what David says and supports! Frederiksen is not saying that her country is being “invaded” or “raped”, for example. She’s not calling for it to be ethnically cleansed, or accusing of foreign men of being predators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a running theme for David. He is desperately trying to convince you that he is not “far right”, his people are not “far right”, his politics are not “far right”. Probably because – for all his bluster about how the label has lost its power — David knows that it’s actually a huge red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t think the label matters. I’ve been calling these people “far right” because it’s convenient and accurate, not because I’m invested in that particular term. Shit by any other name would smell as foul, and David and his friends are extremely pungent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s ditch the superlatives and review David’s post objectively:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;He thinks that even if you were born in the UK, you only count as British if you’re white.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;He wouldn’t consider living in London specifically because it has too many people of color.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;He uses racist tropes to accuse Asian men of being dangerous predators who attack white women.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;He pushes debunked conspiracy theories about immigrants replacing white people.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;He finds a march where speakers called for banning all non-Christian religions and ethnically cleansing immigrants “heartwarming”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally — and maybe most alarmingly — he argues that all of the above is normal and not extreme.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use whatever word you want to describe all that. But if you, like me, didn’t realize that this is who DHH is, we can probably agree that he’s way worse than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The rest are non-British subcategories of “White”, which come in at a cumulative 17%. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You might notice the name is similar to Tommy Robinson’s “Unite the Kingdom” march, which I am skeptical is a coincidence. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
