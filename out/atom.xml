Alterations can enable small changes to otherwise static garments, but these changes often require sewing and are non-reversible. We propose a modular approach to garment design that considers resizing, restyling, and reuse earlier in the design process. Our contributions include a compact set of modules and connectors that form the building blocks of modular garments, a method to decompose a garment into modules via integer linear programming, and a digital design tool that supports modular garment design and simulation. Our user evaluation suggests that our approach to modular design can support the creation of a wide range of garments and can help users transform them across sizes and styles while reusing the same building blocks.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I posted about how much fun I was having with the Fomu FPGA development board while travelling. This project from Tim ‘mithro’ Ansell and Sean ‘xobs’ Cross is not new, but remains a favorite of mine because of how portable it is — the entire board can fit in your USB port!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fomu includes a Lattice Semiconductor iCE40 UltraPlus 5K, which has been a popular FPGA option over the past few years due to the reverse engineered bitstream format and ability to program it with a fully open source toolchain (see updated repository here). One of the more recent production uses I have heard about is in the Oxide Computer, which I discussed with Nathanael Huffman on an episode of Microarch Club and has also come up on the Oxide &amp;amp; Friends podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting attributes of the Fomu is that, despite the fact that it is programmed over USB, it doesn’t actually include any USB peripheral hardware. Instead, in order to make the board small enough to fit in the USB port, the USB core is implemented in RTL (Fomu uses ValentyUSB) and is included in the Foboot bootloader. Most FPGAs support writing bitstreams directly into SRAM, meaning that it will have to be reprogrammed after a power cycle, or storing a bistream in a separate flash IC that the FPGA will read from when powered on. iCE40 FPGAs are no different, but also include a Non-Volatile Configuration Memory (NVCM), which allows for one-time programming of a bitstream in high-volume applications. From the iCE40 Programming and Configuration Technical Note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;iCE40 components are configured for a specific application by loading a binary configuration bitstream image, generated by the Lattice development system. For high-volume applications, the bitstream image is usually permanently programmed in the on-chip Non-volatile Configuration Memory. However, the bitstream image can also be stored externally in a standard, low-cost commodity SPI serial Flash PROM. The iCE40 component can automatically load the image using the SPI Master Configuration Interface. Similarly, the iCE40 configuration data can be downloaded from an external processor, microcontroller, or DSP using an SPI-like serial interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that the Fomu is primarily intended for prototyping and education, utilizing the NVCM is unnecessary. However, it does include a GD25Q16CEIGR flash chip for persistent bitstream storage. Despite the Fomu hardware also being open source, I hadn’t spent much time looking at the schematic when developing with it in the past. However, while on the plane ride back from my travels, I was reading some of the documentation for the device and became curious about how the device supported both loading bitstreams into SRAM on the iCE40 and into the external flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other FPGA development boards, such as the Arty A7 I have previously written about, support configuring the FPGA’s SRAM by including a USB to Serial IC (the Arty A7 uses the FTDI FT2232HQ) that can be used to configure the FPGA directly, or configure the FPGA with a bitstream that allows it to talk to the SPI flash, which is subsequently used to store the user bitstream in flash. From the Arty A7 reference manual:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When programming a nonvolatile flash device, a bitstream file is transferred to the flash in a two-step process. First, the FPGA is programmed with a circuit that can program flash devices, and then data is transferred to the flash device via the FPGA circuit (this complexity is hidden from the user by the Xilinx tools). This is called indirect programming. After the flash device has been programmed, it can automatically configure the FPGA at a subsequent power-on or reset event as determined by the mode jumper setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as previously mentioned, the Fomu’s USB core is implemented in RTL, which presents a few challenges. Namely, the FPGA needs to be “bootstrapped” — we cannot configure the FPGA or the SPI flash via USB without the USB core already running on the FPGA. Fomu uses a bootloader, Foboot, which includes gateware for a RISC-V core (VexRiscv) and various peripherals, as well as software for USB and DFU suppport. If you buy a Fomu, Foboot will already be present on the device. You can update Foboot using the Booster program, but if you somehow perform a faulty update, you could find yourself with a bricked device that cannot be accesed over USB. In that case, you’ll need to be able to access the components by some other means. Or, if you’re like me, you might just be interested in loading alternative gateware and software onto the device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fomu hardware repository has a nice image with some of the board’s test points labeled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing that I noticed was that there was only one “chip select” (&lt;code&gt;SPI_CS&lt;/code&gt;) test point. Both the FPGA and the flash IC can act as SPI
peripherals, and typically a &lt;code&gt;CS&lt;/code&gt; line is required from the controller to each
peripheral in a multidrop configuration, or peripherals can be
daisy-chained
if supported. The iCE40 is particularly interesting in this scenario because, as
previously mentioned, it can act as a controller when reading from the flash IC,
or as a peripheral when being configured directly. When supplying power, the
iCE40 will act as a SPI controller by default and attempt to load a bistream
from the flash IC. If we want to program the flash directly via the test points,
then we need to keep the iCE40 from attempting to control it. This is possible
because the &lt;code&gt;CRESET&lt;/code&gt; pin is also available on a test point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown in the technical note, driving &lt;code&gt;CRESET&lt;/code&gt; low will reset the device, and
configuration will not begin until the next rising edge. At this point it is
clear how we can go about programming the flash IC: hold the iCE40 in reset
while we program the flash using the exposed SPI test points. One plausible
assumption is that only the flash IC can be accessed over SPI via the test
points. In fact, we really don’t need direct access to the iCE40 because if the
flash IC can be programmed, then the iCE40 will load the persistent bitstream
when powered on, and a bricked device could be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the iCEstick evaluation board made by Lattice Semiconductor, which uses an FTDI FT2232H in similar fashion to the Arty A7, takes this to heart. In the user guide, it states the following under “Known Issue”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This board is designed for SPI flash programming only. This would prevent the iCE device from being accidentally NVCM programmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This is also called out in the help output for &lt;code&gt;iceprog&lt;/code&gt;,
a programming tool included in Project IceStorm.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you would expect, this is reflected in the schematic from the same document. The SPI chip select pins on the iCE40 and the flash IC have a pull-up resistor, and the &lt;code&gt;iCE_SS_B&lt;/code&gt; net allows for pulling the &lt;code&gt;CS&lt;/code&gt; pin on the flash IC low for
programming, while the iCE40 &lt;code&gt;SPI_SS_B&lt;/code&gt; pin drives it after boot when the FPGA
is acting as the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as you may have noticed in the first image in this post, the note on the Fomu schematic indicates that both the iCE40 and the flash IC can be programmed via the test points. This complicates things a bit because, up until now, each component only ever plays a single role:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The iCE40 FPGA is always a SPI controller.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The programmer (e.g. the machine connected to the test points) is always a SPI controller.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The flash IC is always a SPI peripheral, either accessed by the programmer or the FPGA.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we are configuring the iCE40 directly, the iCE40 now needs to act as a peripheral, and the flash IC needs to no longer be driven by traffic on the SPI nets. Though not labeled in the device image, opening the design in the KiCad PCB viewer reveals the placement of the &lt;code&gt;SPI_IO2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SPI_IO3&lt;/code&gt; (as well as the
&lt;code&gt;CDONE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;USB_P&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;USB_N&lt;/code&gt;) test points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SPI_IO3&lt;/code&gt; is connected to the flash IC &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin. This is in contrast to the
iCEstick, where the flash IC’s &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin has a pull-up resistor (i.e. the
active low pin is never asserted). Because we have access to the &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin on
the Fomu, we can drive it low to have the flash IC ignore all SPI traffic while
configuring the iCE40 directly. We also need to swap the pins used for the MOSI
and MISO signals, as &lt;code&gt;SPI_MOSI&lt;/code&gt; is connected to the iCE40’s &lt;code&gt;SPI_SO&lt;/code&gt; pin, and
&lt;code&gt;SPI_MISO&lt;/code&gt; is connected to &lt;code&gt;SPI_SI&lt;/code&gt;. When I looked at
&lt;code&gt;fomu-flash&lt;/code&gt;, a utility to program Fomu
boards using a Raspberry Pi, it appeared as though that was exactly what was
happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;        spiHold(spi);
        spiSwapTxRx(spi);
        fpgaResetSlave(fpga);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, upon further inspection, &lt;code&gt;spiHold()&lt;/code&gt; is not actually asserting the
&lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin, but rather issuing a
command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void spiHold(struct ff_spi *spi) {
	spiBegin(spi);
	spiCommand(spi, 0xb9);
	spiEnd(spi);
}
void spiUnhold(struct ff_spi *spi) {
	spiBegin(spi);
	spiCommand(spi, 0xab);
	spiEnd(spi);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In looking up the &lt;code&gt;spiHold()&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;spiUnhold()&lt;/code&gt; commands in the GD25Q16CEIGR
datasheet,
I observed that they correspond to “Deep Power-Down (DP)” (&lt;code&gt;0xb9&lt;/code&gt;) and “Release
from Deep Power-Down and Read Device ID (RDI)” (&lt;code&gt;0xab&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Executing the Deep Power-Down (DP) command is the only way to put the device in the lowest consumption mode (the Deep Power-Down Mode). It can also be used as an extra software protection mechanism, while the device is not in active use, since in this mode, the device ignores all Write, Program and Erase commands… Once the device has entered the Deep Power-Down Mode, all commands are ignored except the Release from Deep Power-Down and Read Device ID (RDI) command. These commands can release the device from this mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why using the power down strategy rather than asserting &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; may be useful. First, the GD25Q16CEIGR supports Dual and Quad SPI, and in
the latter case the &lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; pin is reassigned as the final I/O pin (&lt;code&gt;IO3&lt;/code&gt;). If
the goal is to configure the iCE40 directly, this may not be too much of a
problem, but the Quad Enable (QE) bit is set in a non-volatile status register,
so a previous interaction with the device where it was set could cause the
&lt;code&gt;HOLD&lt;/code&gt; strategy to fail (with the Fomu specifically, I suspect that would also
cause issues any time the iCE40 attempted to control the flash IC). Perhaps a
more likely motivator is that it reduces the number of test points that need to
be accessed to configure the iCE40 directly. Only the 7 labeled in the initial
image (&lt;code&gt;5V&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CRESET&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_MOSI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_MISO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_CLK&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SPI_CS&lt;/code&gt;) are
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FPGAs are fascinating on many dimensions, but one of the most interesting is how they are configured. As we can see with the Fomu and other iCE40 based platforms, the capabilities of the FPGA can lead to some interesting board design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‘ve done such a thorough job of de-Googling that I forgot to show up for a meeting with someone, because I hadn’t checked my Google calendar in ages. (No, they were not amused.) In my defense, I proceeded to explain to them that having de-Googled, I was also in the process of de-Appling, which is a special bonus level that those of us in the UK have unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this in the sunlit uplands, you need to start that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to start that because, as we recently learned, at some point in the very near future Apple is withdrawing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature from the UK altogether as a result of the Home Office TCN through the Investigatory Powers Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users who already had ADP enabled when the first TCN became public in February will be required to manually switch it off or lose their iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not going to explain the chapter and verse of the legal saga today, because I prefer to do that for people who pay me to explain them the chapter and verse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will say that the shutdown of ADP is Apple being on the right side of the geopolitical fight, as inconvenient as that may be to you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the whole debacle blew up in February, Apple announced that ADP would no longer be available for new users, but would remain unaffected for those of us who already had it activated. That assurance was nothing to sleep on, and so we have been waiting for the inevitable. Apple’s September update confirmed that its days are numbered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what does that mean for you? Again, from their September update:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our communication services, like iMessage and FaceTime, remain end-to-end encrypted globally, including in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users in the UK who have not already enabled Advanced Data Protection will no longer have the option to do so. That means the 10 iCloud data categories covered by ADP will be protected by Standard Data Protection, and UK users will not have a choice to benefit from end-to-end encryption for these categories: iCloud Backup; iCloud Drive; Photos; Notes; Reminders; Safari Bookmarks; Siri Shortcuts; Voice Memos; Wallet Passes; and Freeform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that if you already had ADP activated, and e2ee is critical to your personal or operational security, you need to get everything in that list – iCloud Backup, iCloud Drive, Photos, Notes, Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, Siri Shortcuts, Voice Memos, Wallet Passes, and Freeform – off of iCloud sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, go into your iCloud settings, click on Manage, then click on each thing individually to purge it off iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to tell you where to move your stuff other than to say that if you’re moving it from one big tech company to another, you’re just being daft. Likewise, if you’re moving your stuff to a non-e2ee service, don’t bother. If you need an e2ee service try Proton. They have a Black Friday sale on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of Notes, first download the Exporter app from the app store. It does what it says on the tin. You’ll end up with a folder full of markdown files which you can upload elsewhere. E2EE being the dealbreaker, I chose Standard Notes. I know a lot of folk who prefer Obsidian or Joplin. Whatever you choose, do not use a non-E2EE note service.*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know as well as I do that you need to be moving everything you can out of the American stack anyway so just stick this task on your to-do list, which should not be Reminders, and get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What about the non-e2ee stuff in iCloud?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full list of what lives in iCloud and how it is or is not encrypted is here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know from the tiny bits of the TCN saga which have been publicly disclosed, thanks to the only two media outlets that are bothering to cover it, that the first TCN was not just for the end-to-end encrypted data protected by ADP. It was for anything on iCloud, full stop, worldwide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…however, the new IPT filing states the TCN “is not limited to” data stored under ADP, suggesting the UK government sought bulk interception access to Apple’s standard iCloud service, which is much more widely used by the company’s customers. The TCN also included “obligations to provide and maintain a capability to disclose categories of data stored within a cloud-based backup service”, the filing states, which suggests the government sought to tap messages or passwords that were backed up in the cloud as well. “The obligations included in the TCN are not limited to the UK or users of the service in the UK; they apply globally in respect of the relevant data categories of all iCloud users,” the IPT filing adds. Tim Bradshaw and Anna Gross at the Financial Times (£)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that you have some serious thinking to do about what you intend to trust to the Apple stack altogether going forward, even things like passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you what to do but once again, you have options. Educate yourself. Consider the opsec and persec needs not just of yourself, but for the people around you who could be adversely affected by insecure data going walkies out of your account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What if I’m not in the UK?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This impacts the UK only: as their September update noted, Advanced Data Protection continues to be available everywhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does mean that if you have someone in the UK on your team, you need to factor them in as part of your threat model. We are all liabilities to our own opsec now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re not in the UK, and you don’t have ADP activated, take 10 seconds to do it right now, you lucky sod.&lt;lb/&gt; Settings &amp;gt; Your name Apple Account &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Advanced Data Protection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What about that second TCN?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the 1st of October, the Home Office issued a second TCN against Apple for the same as before, but only for British citizens’ data. World-leading!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those who follow my work know that this phrase made me spew a double barrel of Glaswegian swearing. British citizens’ data, as opposed to British users’ data? The dividing line here is not e.g. being located in the UK or having registered an account here, but what it says on your passport? How is Apple going to know that, much less roll it out? (/s)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did Apple just publicly state that they’re going to be removing a security layer and adding a nationality check layer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t know because as with the first TCN, that information only became available in the public domain due to someone leaking it to the media. That’s all there is to know. Everything else is confidential and NCND. There is nothing else to say because nothing else is known. If someone who did know something was sitting across from me right now, and they told me, they would be committing a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those of us who care about these things enough to show up in difficult places are keeping tabs on both TCNs, and the wider legal and technical implications of both, as best we possibly can. Don’t expect to hear anything more until January, when the Liberty/PI challenge on the first TCN goes to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. In the interim, if you want me to bore you about ECHR case law and how the UK’s review into Article 8 seems a little too coincidentally timed, pick a pub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, please make sure you de-Apple, de-Google, and de-American Stack yourself when you have time, clarity, and focus to do it. Start today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime please follow and support the only media coverage being produced about the second TCN, which comes from Bill Goodwin at Computer Weekly and Tim Bradshaw and Anna Gross at the Financial Times (£).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above all, please remember that this is the sunlit uplands. That’s the thing about Brexit Britain having decided to go it alone where tech regulation is concerned. It did not become the vanguard of a “world-leading” third way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his 1933 essay “The Triumph of Stupidity,” Bertrand Russell remarked that “the problem with the world is that the stupid are cocksure, while the intelligent are full of doubt.” This is something I often think about when ChatGPT hits me up with another “that’s a fantastic idea” when the idea is clearly anything but great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How often do you think a ChatGPT user walks away not just misinformed, but misinformed with conviction? I would bet this happens all the time. And I can’t help but wonder what the effects are in the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can relate to this on a personal level: As I ChatGPT user I notice that I’m often left with a sense of certainty. After discussing an issue with an LLM I feel like I know something — a lot, perhaps — but more often than not this information is either slightly incorrect or completely wrong. And you know what? I can’t help it. Even when I acknowledge this illusion, I can’t help chasing the wonderful feeling of conviction these models give. It’s great to feel like you know almost everything. Of course I come back for more. And it’s just not the feeling; I would be dishonest to claim these models wouldn’t have huge utility. Yet I’m a little worried about the psychological dimension of this whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They say AI is a mirror. This summarizes my experience. I feel LLMs “amplify” thinking. These models make your thoughts reverberate by taking them to multiple new directions. And sometimes these directions are really interesting. The thing is, though, that this goes both ways: A short ChatGPT session may help improve a good idea to a great idea. On the other hand, LLMs are amazing at supercharging self-delusion. These models will happily equip misguided thinking with a fluent, authoritative voice, which, in turn, sets up a psychological trap by delivering nonsense in a nice package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it’s so insanely habit-forming! I almost instinctively do a little back and forth with an LLM when I want to work on an idea. It hasn’t even been that long (these models have been around for, what, three years?) and I’m so used to them that I feel naked without. It’s getting even comical sometimes. When I lost my bag the other day and was going through the apartment looking for it, my first response to my growing frustration was that “I should ask ChatGPT where it is”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like LLMs are a fairly boring technology. They are stochastic black boxes. The training is essentially run-of-the-mill statistical inference. There are some more recent innovations on software/hardware-level, but these are not LLM-specific really. Is it too sardonic to say that the real “innovation” was throwing enough money at the problem to train the models at a huge scale? Maybe RLHF was a real innovation; I’m not sure. However, I don’t really feel like there is a lot to be interested in there. And yet, the current AI boom is extraordinarily interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the impact. The very real effect of all this in our lives. In hindsight, this will probably be one of the major shifts, and it will be reflected upon in terms of education, work and even society at large. Language cuts to the core of what and who we are. Speech is so natural to us that we even think in speech. And when a machine credibly stepped into that territory, something changed. I’m not sure what it is — I don’t think anyone really knows at this point — but I think there is a sense of shifting tides. I think it’s something most of us are trying to make sense of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think LLMs should not be seen as knowledge engines but as confidence engines. That, I feel, would better illustrate the potential near and medium-term futures we are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;RYANAIR ISSUES REMINDER TO PASSENGERS AHEAD OF MOVE TO 100% DIGITAL BOARDING PASSES FROM WEDNESDAY (12 NOV)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryanair, Europe’s No.1 airline, today (Thurs, 6 Nov) reminded passengers that from Wed (12 Nov) it will move to 100% digital boarding passes. This means that from Wed (12 Nov) passengers will no longer be able to download and print a physical paper boarding pass but will instead need to use the digital boarding pass generated in their “myRyanair” app during check-in to board their Ryanair flight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This transition, already adopted by nearly 80% of Ryanair’s 207M+ annual passengers, will deliver a faster, smarter, and greener travel experience. It will also give passengers easier access to a range of innovative in-app features, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Order to Seat: Order food and drinks from your phone and get served first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Live Flight Information: Real-time status updates on boarding, gates, and delays.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct Updates: Instant notifications from Ryanair’s operations centre during disruption.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alternative Flight Options: Real-time alternative flight options during disruption.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Travel Documents: accessible in one convenient place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ryanair CMO, Dara Brady, said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are now just a little less than a week out from our move to 100% digital boarding passes, meaning that from Wednesday, 12 November, passengers will no longer be able to download and print a physical paper boarding pass but will instead need to use the digital boarding pass generated in their “myRyanair” app during check-in to board their Ryanair flight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While over 80% of passengers already use digital boarding passes, and therefore won’t be affected by this progressive change, we remind the small number of passengers who still print boarding passes to download the myRyanair app ahead of the move to 100% digital boarding passes from Wednesday, 12 November.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving fully digital means a faster, smarter, and greener experience for passengers, whilst also providing easier access to a range of innovative in-app features, including ‘Order to Seat’, live flight information and direct updates during disruption. We look forward to delivering an enhanced travel experience for 100% of our customers, streamlined through our best-in-class myRyanair app.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When GOG’s new Preservation Program was announced last November, the very welcome scheme to ensure games keep running on modern machines in perpetuity had some lofty goals. The purpose is to create a hundreds-long list of games that the Polish CD Projekt subsidiary will commit to constantly maintaining, evenâit turns outâif the GOG storefront loses the rights to sell them. A lifelong commitment to preserve games, no matter how abandoned they might be by their original publishers. Hooray, we cried, as a gaming public. And while the project is very definitely pushing ahead, it turns out it’s proving a lot trickier than the company first thought. It’s even involved hiring a private detective to identify the owner of a specific game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking toÂ The Games Business‘s Christopher Dring (thanks RPS), GOG’s senior business development manager Marcin Paczynski and its managing director Maciej GoÅÄbiewski explained that the speed at which games stop working, and the multifarious ways in which it happens, is proving a very hefty challenge. “To be perfectly honest, itâs harder than we thought it would be,” Paczynski told the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that over the last couple of decades, many of the 3,000 games GOG previously restored and ensured could work have already started to become unplayable again. So the plan was to go back over the archive and update the games with more modern solutions and fixes, while promising the “lifetime guarantee.” But, as Paczynski puts it, “what we found out when we started working on it is that the games and how they work has deteriorated way faster than we thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just as simple as fixing issues with the games not launching, but more specific issues within. “We are talking about more subtle things,” Paczynski explains, “like the game not supporting modern controllers, the game not supporting ultra-wide screens or modern resolutions, or even a simple thing like being able to minimize the game.” The consequences of this are far from devastating, but it’s tempering GOG’s ambitions a little. The goal had been to reach 500 games in the Preservation Program by the end of 2025, but instead its now looking at 300 to 350.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all made far more complicated by many older games having been released entangled in all manner of DRM, and the way in which IP holders can be incredibly difficult about accessing source code, let alone trying to work out who exactly holds the IP rights to games.Â The rest of the interview is well worth a watch, as the GOG guys get into the peculiar world of trying to secure out-of-publication games, which apparently can even include reaching out to oil refineries. But most extraordinarily, the company has even resorted to using private detectives to track down reclusive rights owners just to ensure it can continue to make a game available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alongside the man who owned the rights to many games GOG wanted to publish who had since become a millionaire oil magnate, there was also a British guy who had inherited the rights to a collection of games, who then fell off the grid entirely. “So we hired a guy in the UK that was supposed to find him,” says Paczynski. It turned out he was living so remotely he didn’t own a cell phone or have internet access, and wasn’t even aware that he had the rights to these games. But when they found him, it turned out he was “super-supportive to preserving the legacy of his family.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously GOG is a business, and this isn’t altruism, but we’re in a time when publishers are abandoning games even in the same year as they’re being launched, so preservation is becoming more pressing than ever. It’s good to know this project is pushing ahead despite the difficulties, even if it has to slightly temper its ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Can the cops get your online data? In short, yes. There are a variety of US federal and state laws which give law enforcement powers to obtain information that you provided to online services. But, there are steps you as a user and/or as a service provider can take to improve online privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement demanding access to your private online data goes back to the beginning of the internet. In fact, one of EFF’s first cases, Steve Jackson Games v. Secret Service, exemplified the now all-too-familiar story where unfounded claims about illegal behavior resulted in overbroad seizures of user messages. But it’s not the ’90s anymore, the internet has become an integral part of everyone’s life. Everyone now relies on organizations big and small to steward our data, from huge service providers like Google, Meta, or your ISP, to hobbyists hosting a blog or Mastodon server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no “cloud,” just someone else's computer—and when the cops come knocking on their door, these hosts need to be willing to stand up for privacy, and know how to do so to the fullest extent under the law. These legal limits are also important for users to know, not only to mitigate risks in their security plan when choosing where to share data, but to understand whether these hosts are going to bat for them. Taking action together, service hosts and users can curb law enforcement getting more data than they’re allowed, protecting not just themselves but targeted populations, present and future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is distinct from law enforcement’s methods of collecting public data, such as the information now being collected on student visa applicants. Cops may use social media monitoring tools and sock puppet accounts to collect what you share publicly, or even within “private” communities. Police may also obtain the contents of communication in other ways that do not require court authorization, such as monitoring network traffic passively to catch metadata and possibly using advanced tools to partially reveal encrypted information. They can even outright buy information from online data brokers. Unfortunately there are few restrictions or oversight for these practices—something EFF is fighting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below however is a general breakdown of the legal processes used by US law enforcement for accessing private data, and what categories of private data these processes can disclose. Because this is a generalized summary, it is neither exhaustive nor should be considered legal advice. Please seek legal help if you have specific data privacy and security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Types of Data that Can be Collected&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The laws protecting private data online generally follow a pattern: the more sensitive the personal data is, the greater factual and legal burden police have to meet before they can obtain it. Although this is not exhaustive, here are a few categories of data you may be sharing with services, and why police might want to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Subscriber Data: Information you provide in order to use the service. Think about ID or payment information, IP address location, email, phone number, and other information you provided when signing up. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Law enforcement can learn who controls an anonymous account, and find other service providers to gather information from.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-content data, or "metadata": This is saved information about your interactions on the service; like when you used the service, for how long, and with whom. Analogous to what a postal worker can infer from a sealed letter with addressing information.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Law enforcement can use this information to infer a social graph, login history, and other information about a suspect’s behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stored content: This is the actual content you are sending and receiving, like your direct message history or saved drafts. This can cover any private information your service provider can access.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This most sensitive data is collected to reveal criminal evidence. Overly broad requests also allow for retroactive searches, information on other users, and can take information out of its original context.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Content in transit: This is the content of your communications as it is being communicated. This real-time access may also collect info which isn’t typically stored by a provider, like your voice during a phone call.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Law enforcement can compel providers to wiretap their own services for a particular user—which may also implicate the privacy of users they interact with.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Legal Processes Used to Get Your Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When US law enforcement has identified a service that likely has this data, they have a few tools to legally compel that service to hand it over and prevent users from knowing information is being collected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Subpoena&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subpoenas are demands from a prosecutor, law enforcement, or a grand jury which do not require approval of a judge before being sent to a service. The only restriction is this demand be relevant to an investigation. Often the only time a court reviews a subpoena is when a service or user challenges it in court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the lack of direct court oversight in most cases, subpoenas are prone to abuse and overreach. Providers should scrutinize such requests carefully with a lawyer and push back before disclosure, particularly when law enforcement tries to use subpoenas to obtain more private data, such as the contents of communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Court Order&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a similar demand to subpoenas, but usually pertains to a specific statute which requires a court to authorize the demand. Under the Stored Communications Act, for example, a court can issue an order for non-content information if police provide specific facts that the information being sought is relevant to an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like subpoenas, providers can usually challenge court orders before disclosure and inform the user(s) of the request, subject to law enforcement obtaining a gag order (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Search Warrant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A warrant is a demand issued by a judge to permit police to search specific places or persons. To obtain a warrant, police must submit an affidavit (a written statement made under oath) establishing that there is a fair probability (or “probable cause”) that evidence of a crime will be found at a particular place or on a particular person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically services cannot challenge a warrant before disclosure, as these requests are already approved by a magistrate. Sometimes police request that judges also enter gag orders against the target of the warrant that prevent hosts from informing the public or the user that the warrant exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Super Warrant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Police seeking to intercept communications as they occur generally face the highest legal burden. Usually the affidavit needs to not only establish probable cause, but also make clear that other investigation methods are not viable (exhaustion) and that the collection avoids capturing irrelevant data (minimization).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some laws also require high-level approval within law enforcement, such as leadership, to approve the request. Some laws also limit the types of crimes that law enforcement may use wiretaps in while they are investigating. The laws may also require law enforcement to periodically report back to the court about the wiretap, including whether they are minimizing collection of non-relevant communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally these demands cannot be challenged while wiretapping is occurring, and providers are prohibited from telling the targets about the wiretap. But some laws require disclosure to targets and those who were communicating with them after the wiretap has ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Gag orders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the legal authorities described above also permit law enforcement to simultaneously prohibit the service from telling the target of the legal process or the general public that the surveillance is occurring. These non-disclosure orders are prone to abuse and EFF has repeatedly fought them because they violate the First Amendment and prohibit public understanding about the breadth of law enforcement surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Services Can (and Should) Protect You&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This process isn't always clean-cut, and service providers must ultimately comply with lawful demands for user’s data, even when they challenge them and courts uphold the government’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Service providers outside the US also aren’t totally in the clear, as they must often comply with US law enforcement demands. This is usually because they either have a legal presence in the US or because they can be compelled through mutual legal assistance treaties and other international legal mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, services can do a lot by following a few best practices to defend user privacy, thus limiting the impact of these requests and in some cases make their service a less appealing door for the cops to knock on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Put Cops through the Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paramount is the service provider's willingness to stand up for their users. Carving out exceptions or volunteering information outside of the legal framework erodes everyone's right to privacy. Even in extenuating and urgent circumstances, the responsibility is not on you to decide what to share, but on the legal process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smaller hosts, like those of decentralized services, might be intimidated by these requests, but consulting legal counsel will ensure requests are challenged when necessary. Organizations like EFF can sometimes provide legal help directly or connect service providers with alternative counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Challenge Bad Requests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for law enforcement to overreach or make burdensome requests. Before offering information, services can push back on an improper demand informally, and then continue to do so in court. If the demand is overly broad, violates a user's First or Fourth Amendment rights, or has other legal defects, a court may rule that it is invalid and prevent disclosure of the user’s information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if a court doesn’t invalidate the legal demand entirely, pushing back informally or in court can limit how much personal information is disclosed and mitigate privacy impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Provide Notice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise restricted, service providers should give notice about requests and disclosures as soon as they can. This notice is vital for users to seek legal support and prepare a defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Be Clear With Users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important for users to understand if a host is committed to pushing back on data requests to the full extent permitted by law. Privacy policies with fuzzy thresholds like "when deemed appropriate" or “when requested” make it ambiguous if a user’s right to privacy will be respected. The best practices for providers not only require clarity and a willingness to push back on law enforcement demands, but also a commitment to be transparent with the public about law enforcement’s demands. For example, with regular transparency reports breaking down the countries and states making these data requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media services should also consider clear guidelines for finding and removing sock puppet accounts operated by law enforcement on the platform, as these serve as a backdoor to government surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Minimize Data Collection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't be compelled to disclose data you don’t have. If you collect lots of user data, law enforcement will eventually come demanding it. Operating a service typically requires some collection of user data, even if it’s just login information. But the problem is when information starts to be collected beyond what is strictly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This excess collection can be seen as convenient or useful for running the service, or often as potentially valuable like behavioral tracking used for advertising. However, the more that’s collected, the more the service becomes a target for both legal demands and illegal data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For data that enables desirable features for the user, design choices can make privacy the default and give users additional (preferably opt-in) sharing choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Shorter Retention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As another minimization strategy, hosts should regularly and automatically delete information when it is no longer necessary. For example, deleting logs of user activity can limit the scope of law enforcement’s retrospective surveillance—maybe limiting a court order to the last 30 days instead of the lifetime of the account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again design choices, like giving users the ability to send disappearing messages and deleting them from the server once they’re downloaded, can also further limit the impact of future data requests. Furthermore, these design choices should have privacy-preserving default&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Avoid Data Sharing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on the service being hosted there may be some need to rely on another service to make everything work for users. Third-party login or ad services are common examples with some amount of tracking built in. Information shared with these third-parties should also be minimized and avoided, as they may not have a strict commitment to user privacy. Most notoriously, data brokers who sell advertisement data can provide another legal work-around for law enforcement by letting them simply buy collected data across many apps. This extends to decisions about what information is made public by default, thus accessible to many third parties, and if that is clear to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;(True) End-to-End Encryption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that HTTPS is actually everywhere, most traffic between a service and a user can be easily secured—for free. This limits what onlookers can collect on users of the service, since messages between the two are in a secure “envelope.” However, this doesn’t change the fact the service is opening this envelope before passing it along to other users, or returning it to the same user. With each opened message, this is more information to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better, is end-to-end encryption (e2ee), which just means providing users with secure envelopes that even the service provider cannot open. This is how a featureful messaging app like Signal can respond to requests with only three pieces of information: the account identifier (phone number), the date of creation, and the last date of access. Many services should follow suit and limit access through encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that while e2ee has become a popular marketing term, it is simply inaccurate for describing any encryption use designed to be broken or circumvented. Implementing “encryption backdoors” to break encryption when desired, or simply collecting information before or after the envelope is sealed on a user’s device (“client-side scanning”) is antithetical to encryption. Finally, note that e2ee does not protect against law enforcement obtaining the contents of communications should they gain access to any device used in the conversation, or if message history is stored on the server unencrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Protecting Yourself and Your Community&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As outlined, often the security of your personal data depends on the service providers you choose to use. But as a user you do still have some options. EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defense is a maintained resource with many detailed steps you can take. In short, you need to assess your risks, limit the services you use to those you can trust (as much as you can), improve settings, and when all else fails, accessorize with tools that prevent data sharing in the first place—like EFF’s Privacy Badger browser extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that privacy is a team sport. It’s not enough to make these changes as an individual, it’s just as important to share and educate others, as well as fighting for better digital privacy policy on all levels of governance. Learn, get organized, and take action.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluate three leading AI models—Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic), Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google), and GPT-5 (OpenAI)—on their ability to solve Google reCAPTCHA v2 challenges. Compared to Sonnet and Gemini, GPT-5's long and slow reasoning traces led to repeated challenge timeouts and significantly lower performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many sites use CAPTCHAs to distinguish humans from automated traffic. How well do these CAPTCHAs hold up against modern AI agents? We tested three leading models—Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT-5—on their ability to solve Google reCAPTCHA v2 challenges and found significant differences in performance. Claude Sonnet 4.5 performed best with a 60% success rate, slightly outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro at 56%. GPT-5 performed significantly worse and only managed to solve CAPTCHAs on 28% of trials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each reCAPTCHA challenge falls into one of three types: Static, Reload, and Cross-tile (see Figure 2). The models' success was highly dependent on this challenge type. In general, all models performed best on Static challenges and worst on Cross-tile challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Model&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Static&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Reload&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Cross-tile&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Sonnet 4.5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;47.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;21.2%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.0%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Gemini 2.5 Pro&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;56.3%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13.3%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.9%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;GPT-5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22.7%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.1%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did Claude and Gemini perform better than GPT-5? We found the difference was largely due to excessive and obsessive reasoning. Browser Use executes tasks as a sequence of discrete steps — the agent generates "Thinking" tokens to reason about the next step, chooses a set of actions, observes the response, and repeats. Compared to Sonnet and Gemini, GPT-5 spent longer reasoning and generated more Thinking outputs to articulate its reasoning and plan (see Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These issues were compounded by poor planning and verification: GPT-5 obsessively made edits and corrections to its solutions, clicking and unclicking the same square repeatedly. Combined with its slow reasoning process, this behavior significantly increased the rate of timeout CAPTCHA errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to Static challenges, all models performed worse on Reload and Cross-tile challenges. Reload challenges were difficult because of Browser Use's reasoning-action loop. Agents often clicked the correct initial squares and moved to submit their response, only to see new images appear or be instructed by reCAPTCHA to review their response. They often interpreted the refresh as an error and attempted to undo or repeat earlier clicks, entering failure loops that wasted time and led to task timeouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-tile challenges exposed the models' perceptual weaknesses, especially on partial, occluded, and boundary-spanning objects. Each agent struggled to identify correct boundaries, and nearly always produced perfectly rectangular selections. Anecdotally, we find Cross-tile CAPTCHAs easier than Static and Reload CAPTCHAs—once we spot a single tile that matches the target, it's easy to identify the adjacent tiles that include the target. This difference in difficulty suggests fundamental differences in how humans and AI systems solve these challenges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can developers and researchers learn from these results? More reasoning isn't always better. Ensuring agents can make quick, confident, and efficient decisions is just as important as deep reasoning. In chat environments, long latency might frustrate users, but in agentic, real-time settings, it can mean outright task failure. These failures can be compounded by suboptimal agentic architecture—in our case, an agent loop that encouraged obsession and responded poorly to dynamic interfaces. Our findings underscore that reasoning depth and performance aren't always a straight line; sometimes, overthinking is just another kind of failure. Real-world intelligence demands not only accuracy, but timely and adaptive action under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Google reCAPTCHA v2 challenge presents users with visual challenges, asking them to identify specific objects like traffic lights, fire hydrants, or crosswalks in a grid of images (see Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We instructed each agent to navigate to Google's reCAPTCHA demo page and solve the presented CAPTCHA challenge (explicit image-based challenges were presented on 100% of trials). Note that running the tests on Google's page avoids cross-origin and iframe complications that frequently arise in production settings where CAPTCHAs are embedded across domains and subject to stricter browser security rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated generative AI models using Browser Use, an open-source framework that enables AI agents to perform browser-based tasks. We gave each agent the following instructions when completing the CAPTCHA:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; 1. Go to: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo &lt;lb/&gt; 2. Complete the CAPTCHA. On each CAPTCHA challenge, follow these steps:&lt;lb/&gt; 2a. Identify the images that match the prompt and select them. &lt;lb/&gt; 2b. Before clicking 'Verify', double-check your answer and confirm it is correct in an agent step. &lt;lb/&gt; 2c. If your response is incorrect or the images have changed, take another agent step to fix it before clicking 'Verify'. &lt;lb/&gt; 2d. Once you confirm your response is correct, click 'Verify'. Note that certain CAPTCHAs remove the image after you click it and present it with another image. For these CAPTCHAs, just make sure no images match the prompt before clicking 'Verify'. &lt;lb/&gt; 3. Try at most 5 different CAPTCHA challenges. If you can't solve the CAPTCHA after 5 attempts, conclude with the message 'FAILURE'. If you can, conclude with 'SUCCESS'. Do not include any other text in your final message. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents were instructed to try up to five different CAPTCHAs. Trials where the agent successfully completed the CAPTCHA within these attempts were recorded a success; otherwise, we marked it as a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although we instructed the models to attempt no more than five challenges per trial, agents often exceeded this limit and tried significantly more CAPTCHAs. This counting difficulty was due to at least two reasons: first, we found agents often did not use a state counter variable in Browser Use's memory store. Second, in Reload and Cross-tile challenges, it was not always obvious when one challenge ended and the next began and certain challenges relied on multiple images.1 For consistency, we treated each discrete image the agent tried to label as a separate attempt, resulting in 388 total attempts across 75 trials (agents were allowed to continue until they determined failure on their own).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the first challenge was Cross-tile, reCAPTCHA presented two images in sequence. Solving the first image did not guarantee success because the second image had to be solved as well. We counted each image as one attempt. In a few cases (fewer than five), an agent solved one image but failed the other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that ClickHouse has acquired LibreChat, the leading open-source AI chat platform that offers a unified interface for interacting with a wide range of large language models (LLMs), giving users and organizations full control over their data, agents, and conversations. We couldn't be more thrilled to welcome Danny Avila (the founder of LibreChat) as well as the LibreChat team and community into the ClickHouse family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LibreChat becomes a core component in our vision for Agent-Facing Analytics, creating a truly open-source Agentic Data Stack. By combining LibreChat's powerful user experience and AI agent framework with ClickHouse's analytical capabilities at scale, it has never been easier to build analytics agents that can be leveraged to expose massive datasets to agents operating on behalf of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who is building agentic analytics already? #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, in similar announcements, the user quotes are often buried deep into the post. We’ll try to do things a bit differently here and lead with the raw, unfiltered user feedback, then state our thesis right after (you can skip straight to our investment thesis by clicking here).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shopify #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shopify, a global e-commerce leader, has embedded AI across its operations, giving employees access to advanced models through a unified internal platform. Using the open-source LibreChat platform, Shopify built tools like an RFP assistant that pulls from company data, rates response confidence, and improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“LibreChat powers reflexive AI use across Shopify. With near universal adoption and thousands of custom agents, teams use it to solve real problems, increase productivity, and keep the quality bar high. By connecting more than 30 internal MCP servers, it democratizes access to critical information across the company”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Matt Burnett, Senior Engineer at Shopify&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shopify runs an internal fork of librechat, and we merge most everything back. I highly recommend other companies give this project a look for their internal LLM system. It works very well for us. https://t.co/ihExJyXY2i&lt;/p&gt;— tobi lutke (@tobi) June 11, 2025&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;cBioPortal #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. The team at cBioPortal recently launched the chat-based cBioAgent that allows users to interact with genomics datasets in plain text (example interaction).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By leveraging the ClickHouse, MCP, and LibreChat stack, we rapidly delivered a prototype to cBioPortal users that empowered them to ask entirely new questions about cancer genomics and treatment trajectories, get quick answers, and explore data in ways not possible through the existing UI. It puts discovery at cancer researchers' fingertips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Ino de Bruijn, Manager Bioinformatics Software Engineering, cBioPortal&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fetch #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fetch is a leading mobile rewards app that allows users to earn points by scanning shopping receipts and redeem them for gift cards. Fetch recently launched FAST: an AI-powered tool that turns household purchase behavior into business intelligence, insights, and media activation. Running a custom UX for the FAST portal, this use case is a great illustration of user-facing agentic analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We built our new product, FAST by Fetch, on ClickHouse to help users instantly discover insights and drive efficient activation. We see agentic analytics as the future of data interaction, enabling more intuitive, dynamic, and impactful use of information. With its unmatched speed and scalability, ClickHouse is well-positioned to power this new generation of agentic experiences, and we’re thrilled to grow our partnership together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Sam Corzine, Director of Machine Learning, Fetch&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;SecurityHQ #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SecurityHQ is a global Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) offering 24/7 threat detection, response, and risk management through its worldwide Security Operations Centres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We reached out to ClickHouse to present our use case in building an Agentic AI with ClickHouse MCP and LibreChat similar to what AgentHouse provide. After understanding the implementation strategy used for AgentHouse, we managed to create a robust working prototype of what we wanted. The integration between ClickHouse cloud and the LibreChat using the MCP server has been flawless, making them one of, if not the best use of text-to-SQL implementation I have ever seen. Now that ClickHouse and LibreChat has joined forces will provide even more seamless interaction to our use case in building Agentic Analytics. Looking forward for a LibreHouse cloud solution for agentic analytics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Nidharshanen Selliah, Associate Data Engineer, SecurityHQ&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Daimler Truck #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daimler Truck, one of the world’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, has deployed LibreChat internally to give all employees secure access to chat tools and data agents. The system democratizes AI use across the company while protecting data and meeting compliance standards. They published a detailed story about their setup of LibreChat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With LibreChat, Daimler Truck is making the power of modern AI available to all employees. This enables the company to bring innovation and progress into everyday work – simply, transparently, securely, and full of new opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;From: https://www.daimlertruck.com/en/newsroom/stories/daimler-truck-makes-artificial-intelligence-accessible-to-all-employees-worldwide-with-librechat&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;and … ClickHouse #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we also use LibreChat on top of our ClickHouse data warehouse internally as well. We deployed several agents that range from product analytics to billing data and support cases analysis. We’ll let you guess from the screenshot below which one is which.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Internally, we also use LibreChat for data analysis and it now handles ~70% of our data warehouse queries for 200+ users. The productivity boost has been remarkable. What impressed me most is LibreChat's vibrant community that continuously contributes and innovates. The synergy between ClickHouse Cloud's blazing-fast query performance and LibreChat's flexible, multi-LLM architecture is unlocking a new generation of data analysis agents - real-time, secure, powerful, and accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Dmitry Pavlov, Director of Engineering, ClickHouse&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s dive into the motivation behind the Agentic Data Stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reducing Time to Insight #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are obsessed with world-class speed and performance at ClickHouse. However, traditional analytics workflows often involve multiple handoffs between data engineers writing queries, analysts building dashboards, and business users interpreting results. Each step introduces latency on the left and right sides of the database, often measured in hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With agentic analytics, that timeline collapses to seconds or minutes. A product manager can ask "What's driving the spike in churn last week?" and immediately receive not just the answer, but the underlying queries, explorations, visualizations, and potential next questions to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is closely aligned with our own experience at ClickHouse. Earlier this year, we introduced our first agent, Dwaine (Data Warehouse AI Natural Expert): an internal agent that enables our team to query business data through natural language. Since then, questions like "What's our current revenue?", "How is this customer using our product?", "What issues are customers experiencing?" or "What's our website traffic and conversion rate?" are getting close to instant answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwaine has transformed how our internal teams access insights, eliminating the bottleneck of hand-writing SQL queries and data requests. Just one month after rollout, ClickHouse internal users generated more than 15 million LLM tokens in a single day on Dwaine. As of October 2025, this is now up at 33 million tokens per day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first 3 months of DWAINE - Token Counts per Day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to experience the power of agentic analytics first-hand, try the public AgentHouse demo, which exposes publicly available datasets via the Agentic Data Stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The open-source advantage #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agentic open-source landscape is currently centered around developer tooling and SDKs, which makes perfect sense given that developers are typically the earliest adopters of emerging technologies. The main open-source projects in this space aim to empower builders to create, extend, and customize agentic systems with SDKs, frameworks, orchestration layers, and integrations. This developer-first focus helps establish the foundational ecosystem and standards needed before broader consumer applications take off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see the Agentic Data Stack as one of the first proposals of a composable software stack that focuses on the higher-level integration story, allowing users to get started and deliver value in no time. Both ClickHouse and LibreChat share the same open-source software DNA, and joining forces strengthens our commitment to that vision:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LibreChat remains 100% open-source under its existing MIT license&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Community-first development continues with the same transparency and openness&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expanded roadmap to bring an even more enterprise-ready analytics experience.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proven playbook is the same one that we applied when joining forces with PeerDB to provide our ClickPipes CDC capabilities, and HyperDX, which became the UX of our observability product, ClickStack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that being good stewards of open-source means not just maintaining code, but actively investing in and growing the communities that depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large Language Models can be tricky to use in production. While grounding responses in real-time data often helps, AI agents are not immune to hallucinations: situations where the model generates incorrect information with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our own experience running internal agents within ClickHouse taught us that the best remediation comes from providing the LLMs with the maximum and most accurate context possible. This can be achieved by commenting the tables using the SQL COMMENT syntax, for example, or by providing more context in-line, in the chat, or part of the system prompt of the LLM session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, robust evaluations are critical for agentic analytics in production because they turn qualitative agent behavior into quantifiable insights, enabling teams to measure effectiveness, detect regressions, and continuously improve system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's next for LibreChat and ClickHouse users? #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For existing LibreChat deployments: nothing changes. LibreChat continues to work exactly as it does today, and we are committed to continuing to invest in it and make sure the community thrives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For ClickHouse users, over the coming months, we'll be releasing tailored integration capabilities that make LibreChat a native part of the ClickHouse experience without sacrificing its generic integration capabilities. Think of it as a “happy path” for agentic analytics in LibreChat. This will include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Seamless integration of the LibreChat experience alongside your ClickHouse Cloud instances&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extended support for data visualizations rendering in LibreChat&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OAuth, end-to-end user identification, security, and governance schemes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tailored context providing (aka. semantic layer)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And many more. Please stay tuned for more updates by joining our communities in Slack and Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, for users of the LibreChat Code Interpreter API (a paid service offered by LibreChat that provides a sandboxed environment for executing code). We are planning to evolve this offering and discontinue this API in its current form. We understand that changes can take time to implement, and for this reason, we decided to set the timeline of this transition for the next 6 months (targeting May 1st, 2026). We will reach out to all code interpreter users directly to coordinate the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For LibreChat users: Continue using LibreChat as you always have, and join our community on Discord if you haven’t already, to connect with other users building agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For ClickHouse users: You can already deploy the Agentic Data Stack by following our user guides in our public documentation and videos&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For everyone else: Experience the power of the open-source Agentic Data Stack with AgentHouse, and let us know how we can help you succeed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, the ClickHouse team would be honored to partner with you on your journey toward agentic analytics. Whether you're using LibreChat today or are interested in building analytical agents, please contact us!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Canadian military will rely on an army of public servants to boost its ranks by 300,000&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Federal public servants would be trained to shoot guns, drive trucks and fly drones, according to a defence department directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Canadian Forces is counting on public servants to volunteer for military service as it tries to ramp up an army of 300,000 as part of a mobilization plan, according to a defence department directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Federal and provincial employees would be given a one-week training course in how to handle firearms, drive trucks and fly drones, according to the directive, signed by Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jennie Carignan and defence deputy minister Stefanie Beck on May 30, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The public servants would be inducted into the Supplementary Reserve, which is currently made up of inactive or retired members of the Canadian Forces who are willing to return to duty if called. At this point, there are 4,384 personnel in the Supplementary Reserves, but in the case of an emergency, that would be boosted to 300,000, according to the directive from Beck and Carignan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the supplementary recruiting push will “prioritize volunteer public servants at the federal and provincial/territorial level” the entry standards wouldn’t be strict, according to the nine-page unclassified directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The entry criteria for the Supplementary or other Reserve should be less restrictive than the Reserve Force for age limits as well as physical and fitness requirements,” the document noted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the initial entry into the ranks, the public servants would be required to do one week’s worth of military training each year but would not be issued uniforms. Medical coverage would be provided for their annual military service, but that time would not count towards their pensions, the directive pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The training focus would be on “basic skills (e.g. shoot, move, and communicate; drive a truck; fly a drone: etc.)”, Beck and Carignan wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their directive approved the creation of a “tiger team” which will work on setting the stage for a Defence Mobilization Plan or DMP. That team will examine what changes are needed to government legislation as well as examine other factors required to allow for such a massive influx of Canadians into the military.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Department of National Defence spokeswoman Andrée-Anne Poulin confirmed in an email that participation in the expanded reserve force would be voluntary. “Initial planning has begun to explore how the CAF (Canadian Armed Forces) could contribute to greater national resilience, including leveraging increased readiness from an expanded Reserve Force for defence purposes, in times of crisis, or for natural disasters for example,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neither DND nor the military would provide comment on the timelines for the creation of the mobilization plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work on the initiative by the tiger team located at DND’s Carling Campus in Ottawa began on June 4. DND would not comment on whether Carignan and Beck have been briefed on the initial work of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The directive also points to a massive increase in the number of Canadian Forces reservists. The reserves are made up of volunteers who are in current military units. Although they are considered part-time, they are involved in training on a year-round basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current reserve force would jump from 23,561 to 100,000 for the mobilization plan. There are no details on how that increase would be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beck and Carignan pointed out that the plan would require a Whole of Society (or WoS) effort, meaning that all Canadians would have to contribute to the initiative. That would require the Privy Council Office to lead a government “approach to population engagement to advance servant culture around sovereignty and public accountability,” according to their directive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Defence will not accomplish the outcome alone, rather it will necessitate shaping, facilitation and engagement with the Privy Council Office, other government departments and agencies as well as socialization with the Canadian public,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tiger team will also consult with Canada’s allies, “including Finland which is a recognized leader in this area,” the document pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finland has a conscription-based military. Every male Finnish citizen aged 18-60 is liable for military service, and women can apply for military service on a voluntary basis, according to the Finnish defence department website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Finnish citizens complete their compulsory full-time military service, they are transferred to the reserves. In May, the Finnish government proposed an initiative that would raise the age limit of conscript reservists to 65.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DND and the Canadian Forces also declined to comment on how ongoing recruitment problems might impact its mobilization plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new report by Auditor General Karen Hogan revealed that the Canadian Forces is not currently recruiting enough individuals to meet its operational needs. “The Canadian Armed Forces continued to have challenges attracting and training enough highly skilled recruits to staff many occupations such as pilots and ammunition technicians,” Hogan said of the report, which was released Oct. 21.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In their document, Beck and Carignan noted the Canadian government has called for greater resiliency and autonomy on security matters. In order to achieve that goal, the Defence Mobilization Plan is needed, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The document does not set out the specific criteria for the mobilization plan to be put into action. But it does mention that global security has been dramatically affected by the rise of strategic competition among states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some Canadian Forces leaders have claimed that a war between western nations and China or Russia could happen in the near future. In June 2025, Brig.-Gen. Brendan Cook, the Royal Canadian Air Force’s director general of air and space force development, warned that Canada needed to rearm for a potential war with China or Russia. That war could come between 2028 and 2030, Cook suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October 2023, the Ottawa Citizen reported on a document issued by then Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre pointed out that Canada is already at war with Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS — European Union officials are ready to sacrifice some of their most prized privacy rules for the sake of AI, as they seek to turbocharge business in Europe by slashing red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Commission will unveil a “digital omnibus” package later this month to simplify many of its tech laws. The executive has insisted that it is only trimming excess fat through “targeted” amendments, but draft documents obtained by POLITICO show that officials are planning far-reaching changes to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to the benefit of artificial intelligence developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed overhaul will come as a boon to businesses working with AI, as Europe scrambles to stay economically competitive on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The (lazy) Git UI You Didn't Know You Need&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When my son was born last April, I had ambitious learning plans for the upcoming 5w paternity leave. As you can imagine, with two kids, life quickly verified this plan 🙃. I did eventually start some projects. One of the goals (sounding rebellious in the current AI hype cycle) was to learn and use neovim for coding. As a Goland aficionado, I (and my wrist) have always been tempted by no-mouse, OSS, gopls based, highly configurable dev setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long story short, I’d still stick to Goland for my professional coding (for now), but during the experiments with &lt;code&gt;nvim&lt;/code&gt;, I accidentally stumbled upon lazygit
Git UI. I literally mistyped &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;gg&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;gg&lt;/code&gt;, which opened up the built-in &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; overlay UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A week later, I have already switched all my &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; workflows to &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; (also outside &lt;code&gt;nvim&lt;/code&gt;), and I have been using it since then. In this post, I’d like to explain why it happened so quickly, so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What makes &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;so special?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How can it make you more productive?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What we can all learn from &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;around designing incredible software with seamless UX?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s jump in!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lazy approach to Git tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likely every developer knows and (in some form) uses the git CLI . It’s relatively simple, and it seems incredibly stable – the only change I noticed in the last decade was the new &lt;code&gt;git switch&lt;/code&gt; command, although I still haven’t “switched” to it from the lovely &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;🙃 .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, it’s common to see developers memorize a few commands you typically use (e.g.&lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fetch/pull&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;config/remote&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;add/rm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;checkout&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cherry-pick&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rebase&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;) and stick to the CLI. In fact, in 2022, 83% of the StackOverflow responders said they prefer CLI to other interfaces
and that number is likely still quite high nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, graphical interfaces and generally other &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; compatible clients do exist:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some of them offer more or less the same &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;workflows as the original&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;CLI, just more visually appealing and with buttons/interactivity instead of remembering the CLI flags, e.g. git gui , GitHub Desktop or&lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;discussed here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Other projects add more magic (e.g. AI), and potentially new light abstractions/workflows in an attempt to simplify or enhance &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;use e.g. GitKraken .&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are even projects like recently popular jj tool that completely abstracts away &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;API and replace it with a new source control flows to “simplify” them or unify them across various VCS other than&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;(e.g.&lt;code&gt;mercurial&lt;/code&gt;, Google Piper and everything else you wished it was&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, but it’s not 😛).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you choose for your work is entirely up to you. Depending on what you are passionate about, how you work with &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and what type of software you are touching (monorepo vs small repos, closed vs open source, GitHub vs other hosting solutions, where you deploy, etc.), different clients might be more or less productive for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: If you’re new to software engineering, don’t skip learning the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;CLI. Even if you use some higher-level interfaces later on, it will help you understand what they do in the background, plus sooner or later you will end up debugging some remote VM or container with no UI access (e.g. CI systems).&lt;p&gt;Also, as documented in the official&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;documentation, “the command-line is still where you’ll have the most power and control when working with your repositories."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, I need something:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;simple and fast to limit the context switch overhead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;CLI-native to have fewer things that can go wrong.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“discoverable” and interactive, as I am bad at remembering keybindings and commands (I need my brain memory for more fun bits).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those reasons, early in my career, I started depending on a hybrid workflow, with a few GUI tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;git gui instead of &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;config/remote&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;add/rm&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;gitk instead of &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;CLI for everything else (e.g. rebasing/complex merging).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t remember why specifically those (AFAIK, decade ago there wasn’t anything else), but I literally have been using them non-stop until this year!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, because of the 1990-style look of those UIs, lack of active development and modern features, I looked around for some alternatives. I remember I was quickly demotivated when I accidentally lost all my local changes on a single mouse click on the wrong thing in one of the tools 🙈 (starts with &lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt; and ends with &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;). After that, I was sceptical I’d find some new tool anytime soon. The arguments to motivate me to make a switch would need to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out, an open mind and a bit of curiosity in a random moment gave more fruit than tailored research. By accident, I noticed &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; and after a short try, it became my main &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s amazing in &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somehow, lazygit ticked so many boxes for me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s easy to use; it makes you productive from day 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It enables you to do more (and faster), even teaching you along the way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s a TUI (terminal user interface), making it incredibly fast, portable and visually consistent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the tool’s benefits are also amazing learning on how to build brilliant devtools and software in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;used via lazygit IntelliJ plugin on my&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;clone of Prometheus project.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, probably the best thing about the &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; is its UX, notably how easy it is to use this tool, with just a basic understanding of the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; CLI. Generally, it seems that a nice user experience is achieved due to deliberate choice of strong consistency, deliberate visualizations and interactive menus. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Consistency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; is incredibly well organized and visually consistent. &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; TUI consists of a set of boxes (“views”) with consistent behaviour. Most views are generally visible, always, no matter what operation you are doing (unless you zoom in). You always have a focus on one box. It’s visibly clear that some boxes have “tabs”. When you interact with boxes on the left, the right box changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; generally sticks to native &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; terms and abstractions, which reduces the initial learning curve. In fact, this tool even teaches you about standard, yet a bit more advanced &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; operations (e.g. &lt;code&gt;bisect&lt;/code&gt; which I used to do manually) and terms (e.g. TIL &lt;code&gt;hunk&lt;/code&gt;
which is an official &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; term for a piece of relevant code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, by default, &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; is pretty consistent with the feeling and keybindings of &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;. This means that &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; will quit the tool, &lt;code&gt;h/j/k/l&lt;/code&gt; (or arrows) are for navigation, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; for filtering and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; for copy. Then, similar to &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; it attempts to follow the name of the command, e.g. &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; commits, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; adds all, &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; amends, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; fetches, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; pulls, &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; pushes, &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; rebases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is incredibly important as your common workflows can be easily memorized and invoked in a quick set of a few keystrokes (see enhanced workflows ). Now, as I mentioned before, that’s a double-edged sword, because if your brain is lazy like mine, you will end up staring at the &lt;code&gt;vim/nvim&lt;/code&gt; view trying to remember what the command was to select and copy things (or quit vim
).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; solves the above with a limited set of commands (that’s a good thing: do one thing and do it well
) and great “discoverability”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Discoverability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; strikes an amazing balance of showing data you need when you need it. When you open this tool, it’s obvious you want to do some &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; trickery, so it’s likely a good thing to give you all you need to know, in a pill:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What repo is this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All staged and unstaged files with changes (&lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What branch are you on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The top ~10 commits on this branch.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Top stash item.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Last git commands you performed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Core actions/commands you can do with their keybindings.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a lot of data! Yet &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; somehow manages to show you all of this without visually overwhelming you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Consistent and self-explanatory views with a flat action menu allow you to find the data you need when you need it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This context is game-changing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you never used this tool, or if you had spent one month doing meetings, reviews and design docs at work, and you return to coding finally, you immediately know where you are and where things are.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It reduces the risk of surprises and mistakes (&lt;code&gt;"ups! I pushed to main directly sorry!"&lt;/code&gt;), saving you a solid amount of&lt;code&gt;SWEh&lt;/code&gt;(software engineering hours) monthly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Normally to double-check those things you would need to run multiple commands and check different windows. &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;immediately removes that context switching.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even if you forget important keybindings for actions, it’s quick to check them on the footer or with &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s more, &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; guides you on all operations with interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interactivity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other UI tools, you have hundreds of buttons, with multiple layers of nested menus. &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; has a different approach. This tool teaches you on the way, what’s possible and when. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Push will give you a warning of divergence with upstream if any. Clicking &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;will do&lt;code&gt;--force&lt;/code&gt;push,&lt;code&gt;Esc&lt;/code&gt;will cancel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rebase will ask you, if you want the interactive one or not and double-check the branch.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interactive rebase is much more guided and interactive, than &lt;code&gt;git rebase --interactive&lt;/code&gt;. No need to manually type and remember special words (e.g.&lt;code&gt;pick/drop/squash&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;p/d/s&lt;/code&gt;). The&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;c-j&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;c-k&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;keys also quickly move commits up and down (reordering).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Git conflicts after rebase will be highlighted. After you fix them &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;automatically will ask you if you want to commit them and auto continue the rebase.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When switching branches with conflicting changes, &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;will automatically ask you if you want to auto-stash those changes etc.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generally, &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; guides you in your workflows with minimal distractions and guesswork. This builds trust very quickly, allowing adoption of faster workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enhanced git workflows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; boosted productivity around git workflows for me and for many other existing happy users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s impressive is that &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; does it without adding entirely new workflows. Instead, it makes what &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; CLI offers much more usable, safer, quicker and discoverable. It teaches you better patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One example is highlighted with custom patching. Imagine you made some changes, committed them, but then you want to bring back a few lines (but not all) to what it was before, from an earlier commit. My previous flow used to be either:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local IDE history (slow-ish, too much granularity (every file save), not always available).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;git gui&lt;/code&gt;tool I clicked&lt;code&gt;amend&lt;/code&gt;which would pull all changed files from that commit to&lt;code&gt;staged&lt;/code&gt;area, then I find lines I want, manually copy them (with those git diff&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;chars!) and paste to IDE, then trim unwanted chars. Pretty horrible habit (:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;, I obviously tried to replicate my broken workflow. I couldn’t because &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; diffs are not intuitively select+copy-able (it might be fixable over time; not the highest priority, but people want this e.g. 1
, 2
). I even +1 one some issue around it
, and I’m glad I did, because the maintainer pointed me to… 10x simpler workflow: native reset/patch per line/hunk flow!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All git diffs in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;(no matter if unstaged/staged/stashed/committed changes) support per line or hunk selection and patching/selection.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this, my “line reset from the last commit” workflow is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;simpler&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;within a single place&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;works for any commit (not only the latest)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps in &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;: focus on commits view &amp;gt; select commit &amp;gt; select file &amp;gt; select lines to reset &amp;gt; patch options &amp;gt; “remove patch from the original commit”. All either mouse-assisted or &lt;code&gt;4 enter enter space &amp;lt;c-p&amp;gt; d&lt;/code&gt; within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those short key bindings are game changers in general. I’d recommend starting with a slower, but careful mouse-assisted flow, then naturally you memorize the needed keystrokes without noticing. For me, after some time, some quick flows became a habit, I was using shortcuts unconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, my common &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; flows, with &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt;, were significantly improved:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Iterating on changes and updating upstream:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My typical flow to ensure clean commit log:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select files to commit &amp;gt; add to the last commit (amend) &amp;gt; force push&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;2 space A P enter&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Iterating on changes and updating upstream with a new commit:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select files to commit &amp;gt; create new commit &amp;gt; push&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;2 space c &amp;lt;type commit title&amp;gt; P&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Syncing branches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I generally do an interactive rebase for this. I avoid merges, unless squashed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select branch &amp;gt; rebase &amp;gt; interactive rebase &amp;gt; arrange commits &amp;gt; rebase options &amp;gt; continue&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;3 r i &amp;lt;s/p/d/.. to arrange rebase&amp;gt; m c&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Removing unwanted commit from history&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally you would need to do full interactive rebase against &lt;code&gt;HEAD~4&lt;/code&gt; or something, but now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select commit &amp;gt; drop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;4 d&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Removing unwanted file changes from commits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select commit &amp;gt; select file &amp;gt; remove&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;4 enter d&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Splitting commit into multiple PRs/commits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is normally a bit painful, but now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select commit &amp;gt; select file &amp;gt; select lines or hunks &amp;gt; patch options &amp;gt; move patch into new commit after the original commit &amp;gt; create new commit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;4 enter enter &amp;lt;c-p&amp;gt; n &amp;lt;type commit title&amp;gt; enter&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Cherry-pick&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically, it meant copying commit SHAs around; prone to errors. Now:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;select branch &amp;gt; select commit &amp;gt; copy for cherry-pick (you can buffer many) &amp;gt; select target branch &amp;gt; go to commits &amp;gt; paste&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;3 4 C 3 4 V&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and many more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What can we learn?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; is not only an amazing tool for everyday use, but also an inspiration around devtools UX. The simplicity, consistency, discoverability, sane defaults, shortcuts for common flows and interactivity
should be on the radar for anyone who builds devtools. Not mentioning deep configurability
, a healthy dose of extensibility
, being fully free (donations possible!
), a healthy OSS situation
and… tool being written 100% in Go! (:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine what other tools we could write, reusing similar patterns or even similar UX! TUI framework and &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; code is fully OSS (MIT)
, so anyone has a healthy base for building different tools. I do have ideas for a few tools, especially around some extremely manual release workflows in our ecosystems. Let’s collaborate! 💪&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope this write-up was useful for you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with the current advancement in GenAI, statistical aspect of LLMs makes them not a great fit for reliable and accurate version control changes that projects and systems have to rely on. Some LLM assist (e.g. generating commit messages) will eventually come to &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; and git tooling, but the core of &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; is to remain incredibly relevant for the (increasingly AI-assisted) software development cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kudos to all maintainers, contributors and sponsors of &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; for an amazing work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feel free to comment, give feedback AND use and contribute to the &lt;code&gt;lazygit&lt;/code&gt; project! Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;
