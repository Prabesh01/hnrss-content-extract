    &lt;p&gt;Bertrand Russell, one of the great intellectuals of his generation, was known by most as the founder of analytic philosophy, but he was actually a man of many talents: a pioneering mathematician, an accomplished logician, a tireless activist, a respected historian, and a Nobel Prize-winning writer, to name but a handful. When he wrote this principled letter at the beginning of 1962, Russell was 89 years old and clearly still a man of morals who stood firm in his beliefs. Its recipient was Sir Oswald Mosley, a man most famous for founding, in 1932, the British Union of Fascists.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;22 January 1962&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sir Oswald Mosley,&lt;lb/&gt;5, Lowndes Court,&lt;lb/&gt;Lowndes Square,&lt;lb/&gt;London, S.W.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear Sir Oswald,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your letter and for your enclosures. I have given some thought to our recent correspondence. It is always difficult to decide on how to respond to people whose ethos is so alien and, in fact, repellent to one‚Äôs own. It is not that I take exception to the general points made by you but that every ounce of my energy has been devoted to an active opposition to cruel bigotry, compulsive violence, and the sadistic persecution which has characterised the philosophy and practice of fascism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel obliged to say that the emotional universes we inhabit are so distinct, and in deepest ways opposed, that nothing fruitful or sincere could ever emerge from association between us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should like you to understand the intensity of this conviction on my part. It is not out of any attempt to be rude that I say this but because of all that I value in human experience and human achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bertrand Russell&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;All systems go at SFO! Waymo has received our pilot permit allowing for commercial operations at San Francisco International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôll partner with SFO to prepare our operations at the airport in phases, beginning with employee testing soon ahead of welcoming Bay Area riders. Pickups and dropoffs will initially start at SFO‚Äôs Kiss &amp;amp; Fly area ‚Äì a short AirTrain ride from the terminals ‚Äì with the intention to explore other locations at the airport in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a major milestone that strengthens Waymo‚Äôs impact on the region and offers residents and visitors an innovative way to travel. With years of experience serving riders at Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) and operations beginning soon at San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC), we‚Äôre accelerating our efforts to serve more airports in more cities as we scale.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAcross San Francisco, we are expanding safe, reliable, and modern transportation options‚Äîsupporting our city‚Äôs economic comeback, boosting our tourism industry, and connecting residents and visitors to everything our city has to offer,‚Äù said Mayor Lurie. ‚ÄúWe announced in March that we wanted visitors to be able to ride in a Waymo as soon as they arrived in San Francisco, and today, we are taking another important step to get there.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBringing the Waymo experience to San Francisco International Airport is about more than just a ride‚Äîit‚Äôs about providing a safe, reliable, magical way for Bay Area residents and global visitors to connect with the places and people that matter most,‚Äù said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre grateful for the partnership with SFO and the vision of Mayor Lurie in making this a reality.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Denmark close to wiping out leading cancer-causing HPV strains after vaccine roll-out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A nationwide study suggests infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 have been virtually eliminated since vaccination began in 2008 ‚Äì protecting even unvaccinated women.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 September 2025&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 min read&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;by Linda Geddes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Denmark has effectively eliminated infections with the two biggest cancer-causing strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) since the vaccine was introduced in 2008, data suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research, published in Eurosurveillance, could have implications for how vaccinated populations are screened in the coming years ‚Äì particularly as people increasingly receive vaccines that protect against multiple high-risk types of HPV virus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deadly cancer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After breast cancer, cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer among women aged 15 to 44 years in Europe, and human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least 14 high-risk types of the virus have been identified, and before Denmark introduced the HPV vaccine in 2008, HPV types 16 and 18 accounted for around three quarters (74%) of cervical cancers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, girls were offered a vaccine that protected against four types of HPV: 16, 18, plus the lower risk types 6 and 11. However, since 2017, Danish girls have been offered a vaccine that protects against nine types of HPV ‚Äì including those accounting for approximately 90% of cervical cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Have you read?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To better understand the impact that these vaccination programmes have had on HPV prevalence as vaccinated girls reach cervical screening age (23 to 64 years in Denmark), Dr Mette Hartmann Nonboe at Zealand University Hospital in Nyk√∏bing Falster and colleagues analysed up to three consecutive cervical cell samples collected from Danish women between 2017 and 2024, when they were 22 to 30 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn 2017, one of the first birth cohorts of women in Denmark who were HPV-vaccinated as teenage girls in 2008 reached the screening age of 23 years,‚Äù Nonboe explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúCompared with previous generations, these women are expected to have a considerably lower risk of cervical cancer, and it is pertinent to assess [their] future need for screening.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;High-risk HPV elimination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research found that infection with the high-risk HPV types (HPV16/18) covered by the vaccine has been almost eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBefore vaccination, the prevalence of HPV16/18 was between 15 and 17%, which has decreased in vaccinated women to less than one percent by 2021,‚Äù the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18 in women who had not been vaccinated against HPV was five percent. This strongly suggests that the vaccine has reduced the circulation of these HPV types in general population, to the extent that even unvaccinated women are now less likely to be infected with them ‚Äì so called ‚Äúpopulation immunity‚Äù ‚Äì the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this good news, roughly one third of women screened during the study period still had infection with high-risk HPV types not covered by the original vaccines ‚Äì and new infections with these types were more frequent among vaccinated women, compared to unvaccinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is expected to fall once girls who received the more recent ‚Äònine-valent‚Äô vaccine reach screening age. At this point, the screening guidelines should potentially be reconsidered, Nonboe and colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, the compact, small form factor PC segment witnessed a significant refreshment with the launch of the Framework desktop PC. If you've missed it and are wondering why this mini-PC is considered so special, it's because it was the first desktop PC to utilise the AMD Ryzen AI Max APU, a processor previously exclusive to laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AMD Ryzen AI Max processor stands out for its exceptional speed and integrated graphics performance, frequently surprising users with its gaming capabilities, even on demanding titles. Users often highlight its powerful integrated GPU, which can leverage a massive memory pool (up to 96GB for AI tasks), allowing it to efficiently handle complex AI and deep learning workloads. The raw performance delivered by this chip makes it a worthwhile choice for intensive tasks and creative workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a collaborator and partner on the Framework Desktop mini-PC project, our first steps involved integrating our NF-A12x25 fan and a fan duct. This way, we could significantly reduce system noise levels while ensuring safe operating temperatures ‚Äì you can read more about this here. But can the Framework Desktop be made even quieter? We wanted to leave no stone unturned to find out, so we took it a step further by trying to integrate our signature Noctua fan grill design that debuted on the Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It must be noted that customer safety and EMC requirements for the mini PC, a standalone electrical item, differ from those for hardware components (such as the PSU) designed to be inside a PC case. The safety standard suggests that ventilation openings on case side panels need to be less than 5mm in diameter. To comply with safety regulations, we created an updated version of the original fan grille as implemented on the Seasonic Prime TX 1600 Noctua Edition power supply featuring more struts and a smaller opening size, ensuring full adherence to these standards. To complement the new grille design, we have also designed a custom, funnel shaped fan duct that makes maximum use of the outermost openings of the custom side panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In combination, the custom side panel and duct design provided a massive noise reduction compared to the stock configuration, particularly in lower fan speed ranges. We have measured around 7 dB(A) lower noise levels at around 50% fan speed, and up to 5 dB(A) lower at higher fan speeds, when compared at the same APU operating temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the custom side panel with our signature Noctua grill as well as the custom fan duct are not slated for mass production at this point, we are more than happy to share the 3D CAD files for everyone who is looking to make their Framework Desktop run even quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the custom side panel and the customised fan ductare available to download at Printables.com for you to 3D-print at home:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom side panel with Noctua-style fan grill&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom fan duct to make best use of the custom side panel&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the quality of 3D printing technologies has advanced so much that you can end up with a nice, clean side panel, which will additionally optimise the sound profile, or bring your APU temperatures down significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes. The findings of these tests may prove surprising. The additional NF-A8 PWM fan, which was added as an exhaust fan at the front of the case, yielded slightly lower temperatures, but at the expense of extra noise emission, so it‚Äôs not a setup that we would recommend from a performance-to-noise efficiency point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While upgrading to an NF-A12x25 G2 does provide some acoustical benefits compared to the stock setup (around 1 to 1.5 dB(A) lower noise levels at the same temperatures), its maximum speed is limited to 1800 RPM, so it cannot match the performance headroom of the 2400 RPM HS-PWM version of the NF-A12x25 that is supplied with the Framework Desktop PC. This high-speed version of the ‚ÄûG1‚Äú fan is a safeguard that ensures the system can maintain full performance in worst-case conditions with high ambient temperatures. In other words, we would only recommend upgrading to the NF-A12x25 G2 if you seek to lower noise levels as much as possible and if you are willing to sacrifice the maximum performance headroom in worst-case scenarios that the G1 HS-PWM fan provides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, after a lot of simulation, experimenting and testing, we can conclude that not all tweaks to the Framework Desktop‚Äôs cooling setup make sense. However, if you have access to a 3D printer, swapping the stock side panel and fan duct for the custom designed ones can help to make your unit run significantly quieter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;304 North Cardinal St.&lt;lb/&gt;Dorchester Center, MA 02124&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a short note today. I‚Äôm in the middle of my trip, which will end in Eindhoven next week (see notice at the end of this article), when I heard that Meta had leaked a video on YouTube of its Monocular AR glasses, which are expected to be disclosed at Meta Connect tomorrow, September 17th at 5 PM PST, at Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Keynote. Although the original leaked video on YouTube has been removed, multiple copies were captured before it was taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog reported on May 11, 2025, that it was likely that Meta was using a Lumus waveguide for their upcoming AR glasses product codenamed Hypernova (see: Meta‚Äôs Hypernova Optics ‚Äì Likely a Lumus Z-Lens Variant). While the codename for the AR glasses was Hypernova, the product is expected to be named Celest. Bloomberg has reported that the Celest AR glasses are supposed to cost about $800 for the base model without prescription correction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below left is a still frame I captured from the video, which shows the diagonal ‚Äúslats‚Äù that form part of Lumus 2-D pupil expansion. This video appears to be a rotating 3-D model, so I was a bit surprised that they showed the slate details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3-D model makes them appear much more visible than they appear in real life. On May 21, 2025, I identified similar pupil expansion slats in Rivet‚Äôs AR glasses in ‚ÄúExclusive: Rivet Industries Using Lumus Waveguides for Military &amp;amp; Industrial AR.‚Äù The images above, middle and far right, compare the Rivet AR glasses to a Lumus Z-Lens waveguide. There is clear evidence that Lumus is being utilized in both Meta‚Äôs first AR consumer product and Rivet‚Äôs military AR glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm likely to be able to see when Zuckerberg gives his live presentation on the 17th. It is assumed that he will showcase the Celest glasses. Hopefully, you will be able to spot the Lumus waveguides when he puts the glasses on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been asked to speak at and partner with the joint MicroLED and AR/VR Connect conference and exhibition in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, on September 23-25, 2025. The Conference operates like a single conference with two tracks, so attendees attend presentations from both. The first day, September 23, is Master Classes and Tours of some Local Labs. The conference proper is on September 24-25th. I‚Äôm speaking at 5:20 PM on the 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Conference is offering my readers a ‚Ç¨150 discount if they use the discount code KarlARVR. This discount code is valid for both the ‚ÄúVirtual Pass‚Äù and ‚ÄúHybrid Pass‚Äù (see the tables below) for virtual and/or physical conferences, which can be attended remotely (this blog receives remuneration for the use of this code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MicroLED and AR/VR Connect have a 12-month pass program that offers a ‚ÄúVirtual Pass,‚Äù which allows attendees unlimited 12-month access to recorded presentations at both the virtual (March) and physical (September) conferences, as well as other materials outlined below. The ‚ÄúHybrid Pass‚Äù includes everything from the Virtual Pass, plus attending the physical Conference in person. The lists below outline the two passes in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MicroLED and AR/VR Connect Hybrid Annual Pass&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virtual Annual Pass&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to meet more readers in Eindhoven in September (please send meeting requests to meet@kgontech.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they use Lumus rather than any internal diffractive waveguide, does it mean that they did not have a plan B for diffractive waveguide beyond SiC and that SiC yields push it out of any sub-1000 dollar product?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is an excellent question. I‚Äôm sure they have both internal and external glass-based diffractive waveguide options. From what I can find, their SiC waveguide color uniformity is terrible, not to mention the cost. It was quite a feat for Lumus to be able to overcome the not-invented-here (NIH) that goes with $1.5B/month that Meta is spending on AR. They had to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the design based on the technical advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lumus appears to have major advantage when you combine, efficiency (Lumus claims about 5 to 10x more efficient than diffractive), image quality, front projection (eye glow), and far field light capture (Meta calls Rainbow capture) overs diffractive waveguides. Often diffractive waveguides will improve some of these issues but at the expense of others (look for example the eye glow from Google‚Äôs XR glasses).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta has made it clear they want to go to wider FOV using SiC, but Lumus already has the ability to go beyond 70 degrees FoV using lower (than diffractive waveguide) glass, no less SiC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The claimed issue for Lumus has been whether their technology can be made in volume. This will be way to prove it one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;C++ has often and frequently been criticized for its complexity, steep learning curve, and most of all for its ability to allow the developers using it to not only shoot themselves in the foot, but to blow off their whole leg in the process. But do these criticisms hold up under scrutiny?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, in this blog post, I aim to tackle some of the most common criticisms of C++ and provide a balanced perspective on its strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is ‚ÄúComplex‚Äù&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is indeed a complex language, with a vast array of features and capabilities. For any one thing you wish to achieve in C++, there are about a dozen different ways to do it, each with its own trade-offs and implications. So, as a developer, how are you to know which approach is the best one for your specific use case? Surely you have to have a deep understanding of the language to make these decisions, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really‚Ä¶ I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, it helps, but it‚Äôs not a hard requirement. Premature optimization is the root of all evil, and in C++, you can write perfectly fine code without ever needing to worry about the more complex features of the language. You can write simple, readable, and maintainable code in C++ without ever needing to use templates, operator overloading, or any of the other more advanced features of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs this idea that for everything you want to do in any programming language, you need to use the most efficient and correct approach possible. Python has this with their pythonic way of doing things, Java has this, C# has this, and Go has this. Heck, even something as simple as painting HTML onto a browser needs to be reinvented every couple of years and argued about ad nauseam. Here‚Äôs the thing, though, in most cases, there is no one right way to do something. The hallowed ‚Äúbest approach‚Äù is often just a matter of personal or team preference. The idea that if you just write your code in the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and correct way, you‚Äôll never need to worry about maintaining it is just plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt worry so much about using the ‚Äúbest‚Äù approach; worry more about writing code that is easy to read and understand. If you do that, you‚Äôll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is ‚ÄúOutdated‚Äù&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is very old, in fact, it came out in 1985, to put it into perspective, that‚Äôs 4 years before the first version of Windows was released, and 6 years before the first version of Linux came out, or to drive the point even further home, back when the last 8-bit computer was released. So yes, C++ is quite old by any standard. But does that make it outdated?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hell no it‚Äôs not like C++ has just been sitting around unchanged from its 1985 release. C++ has been actively developed and improved upon for over 40 years now, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. The most recent version of the C++ standard, C++20, was released in 2020 and introduced a number of new features and improvements to the language. C++23 has introduced significant enhancements, particularly in the standard library and constexpr capabilities. Notably, concepts, ranges, and coroutines have been expanded, bringing modern programming paradigms to C++ and making the language more powerful and expressive th an ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dave, what we mean by outdated is that other languages have surpassed C++ and provide a better developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matter of personal taste, I guess, C++ is still one of the most widely used programming languages with a huge ecosystem of libraries and tools. It‚Äôs used in a wide range of applications, from game development to high-performance computing to embedded systems. Many of the most popular and widely used software applications in the world are written in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think C++ is outdated by any stretch of the imagination; you have to bend the definition of outdated quite a bit to make that claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is ‚ÄúUnsafe‚Äù&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, finally, we get to the big one, and yes, I will draw comparisons to Rust as it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmemory safe‚Äù language that a lot of people claim will or should replace C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, let‚Äôs get the main point out of the way right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rewrites of C++ codebases to Rust always yield more memory-safe results than before.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countless companies have cited how they improved their security or the amount of reported bugs or memory leaks by simply rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now is that because of Rust? I‚Äôd argue in some small part, yes. However, I think the biggest factor is that any rewrite of an existing codebase is going to yield better results than the original codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you rewrite a codebase, you have the opportunity to rethink and redesign the architecture, fix bugs, and improve the overall quality of the code. You get to leverage all the lessons learned from the previous implementation, all the issues that were found and fixed, and you already know about. All the headaches that would be too much of a pain to fix in the existing codebase, you can just fix them in the new one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if you will that you‚Äôve built a shed, it was a bit wobbly, and you didn‚Äôt really understand proper wood joinery when you first built it, so it has a few other issues, like structural integrity and a leaky roof. After a few years, you build a new one, and this time you know all the mistakes you made the first time around, so you build it better, stronger, and more weatherproof. In the process, you decide to replace the materials you‚Äôve previously used, say for example, instead of using maple, you opt for oak. Is it correct to say that the new shed is better only because you used oak instead of maple? Or is that a really small part of the overall improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs how I feel when I see these companies claim that rewriting their C++ codebases in Rust has made them more memory safe. It‚Äôs not because of Rust, it‚Äôs because they took the time to rethink and redesign their codebase and implemented all the lessons learned from the previous implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But that does not deny the fact that C++ is unsafe.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, C++ can be unsafe if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. But here‚Äôs the thing: all programming languages are unsafe if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. You can write unsafe code in Rust, you can write unsafe code in Python, you can write unsafe code in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory safety is just one aspect of safety in programming languages; you can still write unsafe code in memory-safe programming languages. Just using Rust will not magically make your application safe; it will just make it a lot harder to have memory leaks or safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù is a bit too vague in this context, and I think it‚Äôs being used as a catch-all term, which to me reeks of marketing speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can C++ be made safer?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, C++ can be made safer; in fact, it can even be made memory safe. There are a number of libraries and tools available that can help make C++ code safer, such as smart pointers, static analysis tools, and memory sanitizers. Heck, if you wish, you can even add a garbage collector to C++ if you really want to(please don‚Äôt).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the easiest and most straightforward way to make C++ safer is to simply learn about smart pointers and use them wherever necessary. Smart pointers are a way to manage memory in C++ without having to manually allocate and deallocate memory. They automatically handle the memory management for you, making it much harder to have memory leaks or dangling pointers. This is the main criticism of C++ in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is Hard to Read&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then don‚Äôt write it that way. C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language; you can write procedural code, object-oriented code, functional code, or a mix of all three. You can write simple and readable code in C++ if you want to. You can also write complex and unreadable code in C++ if you want to. It‚Äôs all about personal or team preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a rule of thumb I like to follow for C++: make it look as much like C as you possibly can, and avoid using too many advanced features of the language unless you really need to. Use smart pointers, avoid raw pointers, and use the standard library wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do a heck of a lot of programming by just using C++ as you would C and introducing complexity only when you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But doesn‚Äôt that defeat the whole purpose of C++? Why not just use C then?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is a superset of C you can write C code in C++, and it will work just fine. C++ adds a lot of features and capabilities to C. If you were to start with C, then you are locked with C, and that‚Äôs fine for a lot of cases, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but C++ gives you the option to use more advanced features of the language when you need them. You can start with C and then gradually introduce C++ features as you need them. You don‚Äôt have to use all the features of C++ if you don‚Äôt want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, going back to my shed analogy, if you build a shed out of wood, you can always add a metal roof later if you need to. You don‚Äôt have to build the whole shed out of metal if you don‚Äôt want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ has a confusing ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ has a large ecosystem built over the span of 40 years or so, with a lot of different libraries and tools available. This can make it difficult to know which libraries and tools to use for a specific task. But this is not unique to C++; every programming language has this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, the simple rule of thumb is to use the standard library wherever possible; it‚Äôs well-maintained and has a lot of useful features. For other tasks like networking or GUI development, there are a number of well-known libraries that are widely used and well-maintained. Do some research and find out which libraries are best suited for your specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid boost like the plague. Boost is a large collection of libraries that are widely used in the C++ community. However, many of the libraries in boost are outdated and no longer maintained. They also tend to be quite complex and difficult to use. If you can avoid using boost, do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you are writing a large and complex application that requires the specific features provided by Boost, you are better off using other libraries that are more modern and easier to use. Do not add the performance overhead and binary size bloat of Boost to your application unless you really need to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ is not a good choice for beginners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming is not a good choice for beginners, woodworking is not a good choice for beginners, and car mechanics is not a good choice for beginners. Programming is hard; it takes time and effort to learn, as all things do. There is no general language that is really good for beginners; everything has its trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact is, if you wanna get into something like systems programming or game development then starting with Python or JavaScript won‚Äôt really help you much. You will eventually need to learn C or C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your goal is to become a web developer or data scientist, then start with Python or JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you just want a job in the programming industry, I don‚Äôt know, learn Java or C#, both great languages that get a lot of undeserved hate, but offer a lot of job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, here‚Äôs the thing: if you‚Äôre just starting out in programming, yeah, it‚Äôs gonna be hard no matter what language you choose. I‚Äôd actually argue that starting with C or C++ is far better than starting with something that obscures a lot of the underlying concepts of programming, I‚Äôd argue further that by starting with Python or Javascript you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run and trading off the pain of learning something when your understanding of a topic is still fresh and malleable for the pain of learning something later when you have a lot more invested in your current understanding of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But hey, that‚Äôs just my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ vs Rust: Friends or Rivals?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust has earned a lot of love in recent years, and for good reason. It takes memory safety seriously, and its borrow checker enforces discipline that C++ often leaves to the programmer. That said, Rust is still building its ecosystem, and the learning curve can feel just as steep ‚Äî just in different ways. C++ may not prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot, but it gives you decades of battle-tested tooling, compilers, and libraries that power everything from Chrome to Unreal Engine. In practice, many teams use Rust and C++ together rather than treating them as enemies. Rust shines in new projects where safety is the priority, while C++ continues to dominate legacy systems and performance-critical domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is C++ Still Used in 2025?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short answer: absolutely. Despite the constant chatter that it‚Äôs outdated, C++ remains one of the most widely used languages in the world. Major browsers like Chrome and Firefox are still written in it. Game engines like Unreal run on it. Automotive systems, financial trading platforms, and even AI frameworks lean heavily on C++ for performance and control. New standards (C++20, C++23) keep modernizing the language, ensuring it stays competitive with younger alternatives. If you peel back the layers of most large-scale systems we rely on daily, you‚Äôll almost always find C++ humming away under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that has stood the test of time. While it does have its complexities and challenges, it remains a relevant and widely used language in today‚Äôs tech landscape. With the right approach and mindset, C++ can be a joy to work with and can yield high-performance and efficient applications. So next time you hear someone criticize C++, take a moment to consider the strengths and capabilities of this venerable language before dismissing it outright.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two and a half years ago, I started my now longest real-world software experiment. I had read an article about how DOOMs engine works and noticed how a variable for tracking the demo kept being incremented even after the next demo started. This variable was compared with a second one storing its previous value. The issue here being, each incrementation would cause the variable to slowly get closer to an overflow, realistically this would never happen in a normal scenario, although it got me curious on just how long it would take until the game would crash due to this.&lt;lb/&gt; I did a few calculations, I don't remember the specifics of it sadly as it has been over two years since that point and I sadly did not document it back then (or I did, but on a partition I no longer have access to) but I remember having gotten roughly 2 1/2 years of possible runtime before an overflow. Obviously, I wanted to know if this would actually happen in the real game on real hardware.&lt;lb/&gt; So I set up DOOM on a small PDA, powered through a DIY 18650 based UPS which itself was connected to the USB port of my router for a constant 5V supply. I left the system running and mostly forgot about it.&lt;lb/&gt; ... Until today when I noticed a pop-up appearing on the device, not long ago from posting this to the board. The game had crashed, only hours after the two and a half year mark, proving that the variable did indeed overflow and cause the expected hard crash of the game: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DOOM crash after 2.5 years of real-world runtime confirmed on real hardware&lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In a move to streamline development and strengthen our commitment to the open-source community, AMD is unifying its Linux Vulkan driver strategy and has decided to discontinue the AMDVLK open-source project, throwing our full support behind the RADV driver as the officially supported open-source Vulkan driver for Radeon‚Ñ¢ graphics adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This consolidation allows us to focus our resources on a single, high-performance codebase that benefits from the incredible work of the entire open-source community. We invite developers and users alike to utilize the RADV driver and contribute to its future.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We are excited about this focused path forward and are committed to the continued success of open-source Vulkan on Radeon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Scavenging Trip&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A downloadable game for Windows and Linux&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Scavenging Trip is a short and challenging simulation game were you are tasked with visiting an unknown planet, collect samples from its surface and leave in time. There are 3 missions with 3 difficulty levels each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A perfect speedrun through all difficulties should take around 10-15 minutes. A first playthrough might take 1-2 hours, especially because of the hardest difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is not a Save feature, as all missions are unlocked and there is not any kind of progression whatsoever (although the order of the missions puts them into context).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Controls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game uses minimal controls, which are rebindable through the Controls menu. Default scheme is WASDQE. Gamepads are currently not supported. The mouse is not used, so it's equivalently playable on a desktop or a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system requirements are very low; if you are able to open this web page on a modern browser then most probably you can run the game at &amp;gt;30 fps. Any GPU from the last 25 years should do. It's recommended to have a Pentium M or better processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supported and tested OSes are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows: 10 or newer (64 bit)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux: *buntu 18.04 or newer (32/64 bit)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More exotic builds are possible for OSes supported by SDL2 and a relatively recent version of the Rust compiler (for example BSDs, Windows 7).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some more technical info for the curious&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is developed using a custom software renderer and custom engine written in the Rust programming language. "Software" rendering in this context means that all graphics-related calculations are done by the CPU. The GPU is used only to present the final image to the display (and scale it depending on the window size).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You own a high-end ASUS ROG laptop perhaps a Strix, Scar, or Zephyrus. It's specifications are impressive: an RTX 30/40 series GPU, a top-tier Intel processor, and plenty of RAM. Yet, it stutters during basic tasks like watching a YouTube video, audio crackles and pops on Discord calls, the mouse cursor freezes for a split second, just long enough to be infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've likely tried all the conventional fixes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updating every driver imaginable, multiple times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performing a "clean" reinstallation of Windows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling every conceivable power-saving option.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manually tweaking processor interrupt affinities.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Following convoluted multi-step guides from Reddit threads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even installing Linux, only to find the problem persists.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If none of that worked, it's because the issue isn't with the operating system or a driver. The problem is far deeper, embedded in the machine's firmware, the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first tool in any performance investigator's toolkit for these symptoms is LatencyMon. It acts as a canary in the coal mine for system-wide latency issues. On an affected ASUS Zephyrus M16, the results are immediate and damning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CONCLUSION
Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. 
You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops.

HIGHEST MEASURED INTERRUPT TO PROCESS LATENCY
Highest measured interrupt to process latency (Œºs):   65,816.60
Average measured interrupt to process latency (Œºs):   23.29

HIGHEST REPORTED ISR ROUTINE EXECUTION TIME
Highest ISR routine execution time (Œºs):              536.80
Driver with highest ISR routine execution time:       ACPI.sys

HIGHEST REPORTED DPC ROUTINE EXECUTION TIME  
Highest DPC routine execution time (Œºs):              5,998.83
Driver with highest DPC routine execution time:       ACPI.sys
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data clearly implicates &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt;. However, the per-CPU data reveals a more specific pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CPU 0 Interrupt cycle time (s):                       208.470124
CPU 0 ISR highest execution time (Œºs):                536.804674
CPU 0 DPC highest execution time (Œºs):                5,998.834725
CPU 0 DPC total execution time (s):                   90.558238
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU 0 is taking the brunt of the impact, spending over 90 seconds processing interrupts while other cores remain largely unaffected. This isn't a failure of load balancing; it's a process locked to a single core.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar test on a Scar 15 from 2022 shows the exact same culprit: high DPC latency originating from &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easy to blame a Windows driver, but &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is not a typical driver. It primarily functions as an interpreter for ACPI Machine Language (AML), the code provided by the laptop's firmware (BIOS). If &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is slow, it's because the firmware is feeding it inefficient or flawed AML code to execute. These slowdowns are often triggered by General Purpose Events (GPEs) and traffic from the Embedded Controller (EC). To find the true source, we must dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand what &lt;code&gt;ACPI.sys&lt;/code&gt; is doing during these latency spikes, we can use Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to capture detailed logs from the ACPI providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Find the relevant ACPI ETW providers
logman query providers | findstr /i acpi
# This returns two key providers:
# Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Acpi {C514638F-7723-485B-BCFC-96565D735D4A}
# Microsoft-ACPI-Provider {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B}

# Start a comprehensive trace session
logman start ACPITrace -p {DAB01D4D-2D48-477D-B1C3-DAAD0CE6F06B} 0xFFFFFFFF 5 -o C:\Temp\acpi.etl -ets
logman update ACPITrace -p {C514638F-7723-485B-BCFC-96565D735D4A} 0xFFFFFFFF 5 -ets

# Then once we're done we can stop the trace and check the etl file and save the data in csv format aswell.
logman stop ACPITrace -ets
tracerpt C:\Temp\acpi_providers.etl -o C:\Temp\acpi_events.csv -of CSV&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the resulting trace file in the Windows Performance Analyzer reveals a crucial insight. The spikes aren't random; they are periodic, occurring like clockwork every 30 to 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Random interruptions often suggest hardware faults or thermal throttling. A perfectly repeating pattern points to a systemic issue, a timer or a scheduled event baked into the system's logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The raw event data confirms this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Clock-Time (100ns),        Event,                      Kernel(ms), CPU
134024027290917802,       _GPE._L02 started,          13.613820,  0
134024027290927629,       _SB...BAT0._STA started,    0.000000,   4
134024027290932512,       _GPE._L02 finished,         -,          6
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first event, &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;, is an interrupt handler that takes 13.6 milliseconds to execute. For a high-priority interrupt, this is an eternity and is catastrophic for real-time system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deeper in the trace, another bizarre behavior emerges; the system repeatedly attempts to power the discrete GPU on and off, even when it's supposed to be permanently active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Clock-Time,                Event,                    Duration
134024027315051227,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS0 start, 278Œºs     # GPU Power On
134024027315155404,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._DOS start, 894Œºs     # Display Output Switch
134024027330733719,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS3 start, 1364Œºs    # GPU Power Off
[~15 seconds later]
134024027607550064,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS0 start, 439Œºs     # Power On Again!
134024027607657368,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._DOS start, 1079Œºs    # Display Output Switch
134024027623134006,       _SB.PC00.GFX0._PS3 start, 394Œºs     # Power Off Again!
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This power cycling is nonsensical because the laptop is configured for a scenario where it is impossible: The system is in Ultimate Mode (via a MUX switch) with an external display connected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The discrete NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) is the only active graphics processor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is completely powered down and bypassed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The dGPU is wired directly to the internal and external displays.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is no mechanism for switching between GPUs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, the firmware is relentlessly trying to power cycle the dGPU every 15-30 seconds. The dGPU in mux mode isn't just "preferred" - it's the ONLY path to the display. There's no fallback, and no alternative. When the firmware sends &lt;code&gt;_PS3&lt;/code&gt; (power off), it's attempting something architecturally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the time, hardware sanity checks refuse these nonsensical commands, but even failed attempts introduce latency spikes causing audio dropouts, input lag, and accumulating performance degradation. Games freeze mid-session, videos buffer indefinitely, system responsiveness deteriorates until restart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, under specific thermal conditions or race conditions, the power-down actually succeeds. When the firmware manages to power down the GPU that's driving the display, the sequence is predictable and catastrophic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Firmware executes &lt;code&gt;_PS3&lt;/code&gt;- GPU power off command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardware complies - safety checks fail or timing aligns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display signal cuts - monitors go black&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User input triggers wake - mouse/keyboard activity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows calls &lt;code&gt;PowerOnMonitor()&lt;/code&gt;- attempt display recovery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NVIDIA driver executes &lt;code&gt;_PS0&lt;/code&gt;- GPU power on command&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU enters impossible state - firmware insists OFF, Windows needs ON&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Driver thread blocks indefinitely - waiting for GPU response&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;30-second watchdog expires - Windows gives up&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System crashes with BSOD&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crash dump confirms the thread is stuck in &lt;code&gt;win32kbase!DrvSetWddmDeviceMonitorPowerState&lt;/code&gt;, waiting for the NVIDIA driver to respond. It can't because it's caught between a confused power state, windows wanting to turn on the GPU while the firmware is arming the GPU cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPEs are the firmware's mechanism for signaling hardware events to the operating system. They are essentially hardware interrupts that trigger the execution of ACPI code. The trace data points squarely at &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt; as the source of our latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A closer look at the timing reveals a consistent and problematic pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02 Event Analysis from ROG Strix Trace:

Event 1 @ Clock 134024027290917802
  Duration: 13,613,820 ns (13.61ms)
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks

Event 2 @ Clock 134024027654496591  
  Duration: 13,647,255 ns (13.65ms)
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks
  
Event 3 @ Clock 134024028048493318
  Duration: 13,684,515 ns (13.68ms)  
  Triggered: Battery and AC adapter status checks

Interval between events: ~36-39 seconds
Consistency: The duration is remarkably stable and the interval is periodic.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every single time the lengthy &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt; event fires, it triggers the exact same sequence of ACPI method calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern is undeniable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A hardware interrupt fires &lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The handler executes methods to check battery status.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shortly thereafter, the firmware attempts to change the GPU's power state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The system runs normally for about 30-60 seconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cycle repeats.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyze the code responsible for this behavior, we must extract and decompile the ACPI tables provided by the BIOS to the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Extract all ACPI tables into binary .dat files
acpidump -b

# Output includes:
# DSDT.dat - The main Differentiated System Description Table
# SSDT1.dat ... SSDT17.dat - Secondary System Description Tables

# Decompile the main table into human-readable ACPI Source Language (.dsl)
iasl -d DSDT.dsl&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This decompiled ASL provides a direct view into the firmware's executable logic. It is a precise representation of the exact instructions that the ACPI.sys driver is fed by the firmware and executes at the highest privilege level within the Windows kernel. Any logical flaws found in this code are the direct cause of the system's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching the decompiled &lt;code&gt;DSDT.dsl&lt;/code&gt; file, we find the definition for our problematic GPE handler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Scope (_GPE)
{
    Method (_L02, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Lxx: Level-Triggered GPE
    {
        \_SB.PC00.LPCB.ECLV ()
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code is simple: when the &lt;code&gt;_L02&lt;/code&gt; interrupt occurs, it calls a single method, &lt;code&gt;ECLV&lt;/code&gt;. The "L" prefix in &lt;code&gt;_L02&lt;/code&gt; signifies that this is a level-triggered interrupt, meaning it will continue to fire as long as the underlying hardware condition is active. This is a critical detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the call to &lt;code&gt;ECLV()&lt;/code&gt;, we uncover a deeply flawed implementation that is the direct cause of the system-wide stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)  // Starting at line 099244
{
    // Main loop - continues while events exist OR sleep events are pending
    // AND we haven't exceeded our time budget (TI3S &amp;lt; 0x78)
    While (((CKEV() != Zero) || (SLEC != Zero)) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (TI3S &amp;lt; 0x78))
    {
        Local1 = One
        While (Local1 != Zero)
        {
            Local1 = GEVT()    // Get next event from queue
            LEVN (Local1)      // Process the event
            TIMC += 0x19       // Increment time counter by 25
            
            // This is where it gets really bad
            If ((SLEC != Zero) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (Local1 == Zero))
            {
                // No events but sleep events pending
                If (TIMC == 0x19)
                {
                    Sleep (0x64)    // Sleep for 100 milliseconds!!!
                    TIMC = 0x64     // Set time counter to 100
                    TI3S += 0x04    // Increment major counter by 4
                }
                Else
                {
                    Sleep (0x19)    // Sleep for 25 milliseconds!!!
                    TI3S++          // Increment major counter by 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Here's where it gets even worse
    If (TI3S &amp;gt;= 0x78)  // If we hit our time budget (120)
    {
        TI3S = Zero
        If (EEV0 == Zero)
        {
            EEV0 = 0xFF    // Force another event to be pending!
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This short block of code violates several fundamental principles of firmware and kernel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 1: Sleeping in an Interrupt Context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Sleep (0x64)    // 100ms sleep
Sleep (0x19)    // 25ms sleep&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interrupt handler runs at a very high priority to service hardware requests quickly. The &lt;code&gt;Sleep()&lt;/code&gt; function completely halts the execution of the CPU core it is running on (CPU 0 in this case). While CPU 0 is sleeping, it cannot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Process any other hardware interrupts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allow the kernel to schedule other threads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update system timers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 2: Time-Sliced Interrupt Processing The entire loop is designed to run for an extended period, processing events in batches. It's effectively a poorly designed task scheduler running inside an interrupt handler, capable of holding a CPU core hostage for potentially seconds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wtf 3: Self-Rearming Interrupt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;If (EEV0 == Zero)
{
    EEV0 = 0xFF    // Forces all EC event bits on
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This logic ensures that even if the Embedded Controller's event queue is empty, the code will create a new, artificial event. This guarantees that another interrupt will fire shortly after, creating the perfectly periodic pattern of ACPI spikes observed in the traces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LEVN() method takes an event and routes it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (LEVN, 1, NotSerialized)
  {
      If ((Arg0 != Zero))
      {
          MBF0 = Arg0
          P80B = Arg0
          Local6 = Match (LEGA, MEQ, Arg0, MTR, Zero, Zero)
          If ((Local6 != Ones))
          {
              LGPA (Local6)
          }
      }
  }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LGPA() method is a giant switch statement handling different events:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (LGPA, 1, Serialized)  // Line 098862
{
    Switch (ToInteger (Arg0))
    {
        Case (Zero)  // Most common case - power event
        {
            DGD2 ()       // GPU-related function
            ^EC0._QA0 ()  // EC query method
            PWCG ()       // Power change - this is our battery polling
        }
        
        Case (0x18)  // GPU-specific event
        {
            If (M6EF == One)
            {
                Local0 = 0xD2
            }
            Else
            {
                Local0 = 0xD1
            }
            NOD2 (Local0)  // Notify GPU driver
        }
        
        Case (0x1E)  // Another GPU event
        {
            Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, 0xD5)  // Direct GPU notification
            ROCT = 0x55                  // Sets flag for follow-up
        }
       
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows a direct link: a GPE fires, and the dispatch logic calls functions related to battery polling and GPU notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PWCG()&lt;/code&gt; method, called by multiple event types, is responsible for polling the battery and AC adapter status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (PWCG, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    Notify (ADP0, Zero)      // Tell OS to check the AC adapter
    ^BAT0._BST ()            // Execute the Battery Status method
    Notify (BAT0, 0x80)      // Tell OS the battery status has changed
    ^BAT0._BIF ()            // Execute the Battery Information method  
    Notify (BAT0, 0x81)      // Tell OS the battery info has changed
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which we can see here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these operations requires communication with the Embedded Controller, adding to the workload inside the already-stalled interrupt handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NOD2()&lt;/code&gt; method sends notifications to the GPU driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (NOD2, 1, Serialized)
{
    If ((Arg0 != DNOT))
    {
        DNOT = Arg0
        Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, Arg0)
    }

    If ((ROCT == 0x55))
    {
        ROCT = Zero
        Notify (^^PEG1.PEGP, 0xD1) // Hardware-Specific
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These notifications (&lt;code&gt;0xD1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0xD2&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) are hardware-specific signals that tell the NVIDIA driver to re-evaluate its power state, which is what triggers the futile &lt;code&gt;_PS0/_DOS/_PS3&lt;/code&gt; power-cycling sequence seen in the traces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where a simple but catastrophic oversight in the firmware's logic causes system-wide failure. High-end ASUS gaming laptops feature a MUX (Multiplexer) switch, a piece of hardware that lets the user choose between two distinct graphics modes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimus Mode: The power-saving default. The integrated Intel GPU (iGPU) is physically connected to the display. The powerful NVIDIA GPU (dGPU) only renders demanding applications when needed, passing finished frames to the iGPU to be drawn on screen.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ultimate/Mux Mode: The high-performance mode. The MUX switch physically rewires the display connections, bypassing the iGPU entirely and wiring the NVIDIA dGPU directly to the screen. In this mode, the dGPU is not optional; it is the only graphics processor capable of outputting an image.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any firmware managing this hardware must be aware of which mode the system is in. Sending a command intended for one GPU to the other is futile and, in some cases, dangerous. Deep within the ACPI code, a hardware status flag named &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; is used to track this state. To understand the flaw, we first need to decipher what &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; means, and the firmware itself gives us the key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For screen brightness to work, the command must be sent to the GPU that is physically controlling the display backlight. A command sent to the wrong GPU will simply do nothing. Therefore, the brightness control method (&lt;code&gt;BRTN&lt;/code&gt;) must be aware of the MUX switch state to function at all. It is the firmware's own Rosetta Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Brightness control - CORRECTLY checks for mux mode
Method (BRTN, 1, Serialized)  // Line 034003
{
    If (((DIDX &amp;amp; 0x0F0F) == 0x0400))
    {
        If (HGMD == 0x03)  // 0x03 = Ultimate/Mux mode
        {
            // In mux mode, notify discrete GPU
            Notify (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.PEGP.EDP1, Arg0)
        }
        Else
        {
            // In Optimus, notify integrated GPU
            Notify (\_SB.PC00.GFX0.DD1F, Arg0)
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logic here is flawless and revealing. The code uses the &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; flag to make a binary decision. If &lt;code&gt;HGMD&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0x03&lt;/code&gt;, it sends the command to the NVIDIA GPU. If not, it sends it to the Intel GPU. The firmware itself, through this correct implementation, provides the undeniable definition: &lt;code&gt;HGMD == 0x03&lt;/code&gt; means the system is in Ultimate/Mux Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This perfect, platform-aware logic is completely abandoned in the critical code paths responsible for power management. The &lt;code&gt;LGPA&lt;/code&gt; method, which is called by the stutter-inducing interrupt, dispatches power-related commands to the GPU without ever checking the MUX mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// GPU power notification - NO MUX CHECK!
Case (0x18)
{
    // This SHOULD have: If (HGMD != 0x03)
    // But it doesn't, so it runs even in mux mode
    If (M6EF == One)
    {
        Local0 = 0xD2
    }
    Else
    {
        Local0 = 0xD1
    }
    NOD2 (Local0)  // Notifies GPU regardless of mode
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the bug. The firmware, despite proving it knows how to check the MUX state, forgets to do so here. It blindly sends a power-management notification to the NVIDIA driver, instructing it to change power states. In MUX mode, this command is nonsensical it's asking the driver to power down the only GPU that is keeping the screen on. This triggers the futile power-cycling, the massive latency spikes, and the system instability. I used an LLM for wording. The research, traces, and AML decomp are mine. Every claim is verified and reproducible‚ÄîETW/ETL logs and commands are in the repo. If you think something‚Äôs wrong, cite the exact timestamp/method/line. "AI wrote it" is not an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a single typo. A second, parallel power management system in the firmware exhibits the exact same flaw. The Platform Extension Plug-in Device (&lt;code&gt;PEPD&lt;/code&gt;) is used by Windows to manage system-wide power states, such as turning off displays during modern standby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Device (PEPD)  // Line 071206

        If ((Arg2 == 0x05))

            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.DHDW))

            }

            {
                GUAM (One)    // Enter low power mode
            }
            
            ^^PC00.DPOF = One  // Display power off flag
            
            // Tell USB controller about display state
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.XHCI.PSLI))
            {
                ^^PC00.XHCI.PSLI (0x05)
            }
        }
        
        // Arg2 == 0x06: "A display has been turned on"
        If ((Arg2 == 0x06))
        {
            // Wake everything back up
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.PEG1.DGCE))
            {
                ^^PC00.PEG1.DGCE = Zero     // Clear "GPU Cut Enable"
            }
            
            If (S0ID == One)
            {
                GUAM (Zero)   // Exit low power mode
            }
            
            ^^PC00.DPOF = Zero  // Display power on flag
            
            If (CondRefOf (\_SB.PC00.XHCI.PSLI))
            {
                ^^PC00.XHCI.PSLI (0x06)
            }
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, the firmware prepares to cut power to the discrete GPU without first checking if it's the only GPU driving the displays. This demonstrates that the Mux Mode Confusion is a systemic design flaw. The firmware is internally inconsistent, leading it to issue self-destructive commands that try to cripple the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traces from multiple ASUS gaming laptop models confirm this is not an isolated issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trace Duration: 4.1 minutes&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;ASUS WMI Calls: 2,370 (a massive number, indicating software amplification)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a built-in "smooth video" check. It plays HD video in full screen and watches for hiccups. If the PC drops frames, crackles, or any driver pauses for more than a few milliseconds, it fails. That‚Äôs Microsoft‚Äôs baseline for what "smooth" should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it matters here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ASUS firmware is causing millisecond-long pauses. Those pauses are exactly the kind that make this test fail i.e., the same stutters and audio pops regular users notice on YouTube/Netflix and games; this firmware violates fundemental standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being different models, all affected systems exhibit the same core flaws:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;_GPE._L02&lt;/code&gt;handlers take milliseconds to execute instead of microseconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GPEs trigger unnecessary battery polling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The firmware attempts to power cycle the GPU while in a fixed MUX mode.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The entire process is driven by a periodic, timer-like trigger.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This bug is a cascade of firmware design failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firmware's &lt;code&gt;ECLV()&lt;/code&gt; method treats a high-priority interrupt handler like a standard application thread, which is fundamentally incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What ASUS Wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    While (events_exist)
    {
        process_event();
        Sleep(100);         // FATAL FLAW: This blocks the entire CPU core.
        check_timers();
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What It Should Be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Method (ECLV, 0, NotSerialized)
{
    // Acknowledge interrupt, queue work, and exit immediately.
    Local0 = EC0.EEV0;      // Read event source
    EC0.EEV0 = 0;           // Clear the event source
    QueueWorkForLater(Local0); // Queue a low-priority task
    Return;                 // Exit the handler in microseconds.
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firmware artificially re-arms the interrupt, creating an endless loop of GPEs instead of clearing the source and waiting for the next legitimate hardware event. This transforms a hardware notification system into a disruptive, periodic timer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code that sends GPU power notifications does not check if the system is in MUX mode, a critical state check that is correctly performed in other parts of the firmware. This demonstrates inconsistency and a lack of quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue is not new or isolated. User reports documenting identical symptoms with high ACPI.sys DPC latency, periodic stuttering, and audio crackling have been accumulating since at least 2021 across ASUS's entire gaming laptop lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August 2021: The First Major Reports&lt;lb/&gt; The earliest documented cases appear on the official ASUS ROG forums. A G15 Advantage Edition (G513QY) owner reports "severe DPC latency from ACPI.sys" with audio dropouts occurring under any load condition. The thread, last edited in March 2024, shows the issue remains unresolved after nearly three years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reddit users simultaneously report identical ACPI.sys latency problems alongside NVIDIA driver issues; the exact symptoms described in this investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2021-2023: Spreading Across Models&lt;lb/&gt; Throughout this period, the issue proliferates across ASUS's gaming lineup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ROG Strix models experience micro-stutters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TUF Gaming series reports throttling for seconds at a time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;G18 models exhibit the characteristic 45-second periodic stuttering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2023-2024: The Problem Persists in New Models&lt;lb/&gt; Even the latest generations aren't immune:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2023 Zephyrus G16 owners report persistent audio issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2023 G16 models continue experiencing audio pops/crackles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2024 Intel G16 models require workarounds for audio stuttering&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evidence is undeniable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Measured Proof: GPE handlers are measured blocking a CPU core for over 13 milliseconds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Proof: The decompiled firmware explicitly contains &lt;code&gt;Sleep()&lt;/code&gt;calls within an interrupt handler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logical Proof: The code lacks critical checks for the laptop's hardware state (MUX mode).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systemic Proof: The issue is reproducible across different models and BIOS versions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until a fix is implemented, millions of buyers of Asus laptops from approx. 2021 to present day are facing stutters on the simplest of tasks, such as watching YouTube, for the simple mistake of using a sleep call inside of an inefficient interrupt handler and not checking the GPU environment properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code is there. The traces prove it. ASUS must fix its firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ASUS has not responded to this investigation or the documented firmware issues at the time of publication, will update this if anything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigation conducted using the Windows Performance Toolkit, ACPI table extraction tools, and Intel ACPI Component Architecture utilities. All code excerpts are from official ASUS firmware. Traces were captured on multiple affected systems, all showing consistent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somehow along the way, a feature that I‚Äôve had across DOS, OS/2, FreeBSD, and Linux ‚Äî and has been present on PCs for more than 40 years ‚Äî is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That feature, of course, is the 80√ó25 text console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux has, for awhile now, rendered its text console using graphic modes. You can read all about it here. This has been necessary because only PCs really had the 80√ó25 text mode (Raspberry Pis, for instance, never did), and even they don‚Äôt have it when booted with UEFI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve lately been annoyed that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The console is a different size on every screen ‚Äî both in terms of size of letters and the dimensions of it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a given machine has more than one display, one or both of them will have parts of the console chopped off&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My system seems to run with three different resolutions or fonts at different points of the boot process. One during the initrd, and two different ones during the remaining boot.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, I wanted to run some software on the console that was designed with 80√ó25 in mind. And I‚Äôd like to be able to plug in an old VGA monitor and have it just work if I want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That shouldn‚Äôt be so hard, right? Well, the old vga= option that you are used to doesn‚Äôt work when you booted from UEFI or on non-x86 platforms. Most of the tricks you see online for changing resolutions, etc., are no longer relevant. And things like setting a resolution with GRUB are useless for systems that don‚Äôt use GRUB (including ARM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VGA text mode uses 8√ó16 glyphs in 9√ó16 cells, where the pixels are non-square, giving a native resolution of 720√ó400 (which historically ran at 70Hz), which should have streched pixels to make a 4:3 image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it is possible to select a console font, and 8√ó16 fonts are present and supported in Linux, it appears to be impossible to have a standard way to set 720√ó400 so that they present in a reasonable size, at the correct aspect ratio, with 80√ó25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tricks like nomodeset no longer work on UEFI or ARM systems. It‚Äôs possible that kmscon or something like it may help, but I‚Äôm not even certain of that (video=eDP1:720√ó400 produced an error saying that 720√ó400 wasn‚Äôt a supported mode, so I‚Äôm unsure kmscon would be any better.) Not that it matters; all the kmscon options to select a font or zoom are broken, and it doesn‚Äôt offer mode selection anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I‚Äôm going to have to track down an old machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most of my generation, I was brought up on the saying √¢Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.√¢ Being a highly virtuous child, I believed all that I was told and acquired a conscience which has kept me working hard down to the present moment. But although my conscience has controlled my actions, my opinions have undergone a revolution. I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached. Every one knows the story of the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was before the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to the laziest of them. Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. This traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that after reading the following pages the leaders of the Y.√Ç M.√Ç C.√Ç A. will start a campaign to induce good young men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must dispose of one which I cannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to engage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or she is told that such conduct takes the bread out of other people√¢s mouths, and is, therefore, wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be necessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths full of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns he usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man spends his income he puts just as much bread into people√¢s mouths in spending as he takes out of other people√¢s mouths in earning. The real villain, from this point of view, is the man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a stocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not give employment. If he invests his savings the matter is less obvious, and different cases arise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some government. In view of the fact that the bulk of the expenditure of most civilized governments consists in payments for past wars and preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a government is in the same position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the man√¢s economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the money, even if he spent it on drink or gambling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in industrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed and produce something useful this may be conceded. In these days, however, no one will deny that most enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which might have been devoted to producing something which could be enjoyed, was expended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good to anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is, therefore, injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in giving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so would all those on whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and the bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for surface cars in some place where surface cars turn out to be not wanted, he has diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one. Nevertheless, when he becomes poor through the failure of his investment he will be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift, who has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a frivolous person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by the belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth√¢s surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind is capable of indefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders but those who give advice as to what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two different bodies of men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is not knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of the art of persuasive speaking and writing, i.e. of advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more respected than either of the classes of workers. These are men who, through ownership of land, are able to make others pay for the privilege of being allowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might, therefore, be expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is rendered possible only by the industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable idleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work. The last thing they have ever wished is that others should follow their example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the beginning of civilization until the industrial revolution a man could, as a rule, produce by hard work little more than was required for the subsistence of himself and his family, although his wife worked at least as hard and his children added their labor as soon as they were old enough to do so. The small surplus above bare necessaries was not left to those who produced it, but was appropriated by priests and warriors. In times of famine there was no surplus; the warriors and priests, however, still secured as much as at other times, with the result that many of the workers died of hunger. This system persisted in Russia until 1917, and still persists in the East; in England, in spite of the Industrial Revolution, it remained in full force throughout the Napoleonic wars, and until a hundred years ago, when the new class of manufacturers acquired power. In America the system came to an end with the Revolution, except in the South, where it persisted until the Civil War. A system which lasted so long and ended so recently has naturally left a profound impression upon men√¢s thoughts and opinions. Much that we take for granted about the desirability of work is derived from this system and, being pre-industrial, is not adapted to the modern world. Modern technic has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves, would not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and priests subsisted, but would have either produced less or consumed more. At first sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus. Gradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an ethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of their work went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of compulsion required was lessened, and the expenses were diminished. To this day ninety-nine per cent of British wage-earners would be genuinely shocked if it were proposed that the King should not have a larger income than a working man. The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this is true; Athenian slave-owners, for instance, employed part of their leisure in making a permanent contribution to civilization which would have been impossible under a just economic system. Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was rendered possible only by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good. And with modern technic it would be possible to distribute leisure justly without injury to civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern technic has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of labor necessary to produce the necessaries of life for every one. This was made obvious during the War. At that time all the men in the armed forces, all the men and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and women engaged in spying, war propaganda, or government offices connected with the War were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the general level of physical well-being among wage-earners on the side of the Allies was higher than before or since. The significance of this fact was concealed by finance; borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing the present. But that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat a loaf of bread that does not yet exist. The War showed conclusively that by the scientific organization of production it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world. If at the end of the War the scientific organization which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work had been preserved, and the hours of work had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that, the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances totally unlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been disastrous. Let us take an illustration. Suppose that at a given moment a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins as before. But the world does not need twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world everybody concerned in the manufacture of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich. In England in the early nineteenth century fifteen hours was the ordinary day√¢s work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very commonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busy-bodies suggested that perhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults from drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say, √¢What do the poor want with holidays? they ought to work.√¢ People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much economic confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us, for a moment, consider the ethics of work frankly, without superstition. Every human being, of necessity, consumes in the course of his life a certain amount of produce of human labor. Assuming, as we may, that labor is on the whole disagreeable, it is unjust that a man should consume more than he produces. Of course he may provide services rather than commodities, like a medical man, for example; but he should provide something in return for his board and lodging. To this extent, the duty of work must be admitted, but to this extent only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I shall not develop the fact that in all modern societies outside the U.√Ç S.√Ç S.√Ç R. many people escape even this minimum of work, namely all those who inherit money and all those who marry money. I do not think the fact that these people are allowed to be idle is nearly so harmful as the fact that wage-earners are expected to overwork or starve. If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day there would be enough for everybody, and no unemployment√Ç √¢ assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are already well-off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners except as the grim punishment of unemployment, in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons. Oddly enough, while they wish their sons to work so hard as to have no time to be civilized, they do not mind their wives and daughters having no work at all. The snobbish admiration of uselessness, which, in an aristocratic society, extends to both sexes, is under a plutocracy confined to women; this, however, does not make it any more in agreement with common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education. A man who has worked long hours all his life will be bored if he becomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man is cut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the bulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish asceticism, usually vicarious, makes us insist on work in excessive quantities now that the need no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the new creed which controls the government of Russia, while there is much that is very different from the traditional teaching of the West, there are some things that are quite unchanged. The attitude of the governing classes, and especially of those who control educational propaganda, on the subject of the dignity of labor is almost exactly that which the governing classes of the world have always preached to what were called the √¢honest poor.√¢ Industry, sobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages, even submissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover, authority still represents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, Who, however, is now called by a new name, Dialectical Materialism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The victory of the proletariat in Russia has some points in common with the victory of the feminists in some other countries. For ages men had conceded the superior saintliness of women and had consoled women for their inferiority by maintaining that saintliness is more desirable than power. At last the feminists decided that they would have both, since the pioneers among them believed all that the men had told them about the desirability of virtue but not what they had told them about the worthlessness of political power. A similar thing has happened in Russia as regards manual work. For ages the rich and their sycophants have written in praise of √¢honest toil,√¢ have praised the simple life, have professed a religion which teaches that the poor are much more likely to go to heaven than the rich, and in general have tried to make manual workers believe that there is some special nobility about altering the position of matter in space, just as men tried to make women believe that they derived some special nobility from their sexual enslavement. In Russia all this teaching about the excellence of manual work has been taken seriously, with the result that the manual worker is more honored than anyone else. What are, in essence, revivalist appeals are made to secure shock workers for special tasks. Manual work is the ideal which is held before the young, and is the basis of all ethical teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the present this is all to the good. A large country, full of natural resources, awaits development and has to be developed with very little use of credit. In these circumstances hard work is necessary and is likely to bring a great reward. But what will happen when the point has been reached where everybody could be comfortable without working long hours?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the West we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no attempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce goes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all. Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle because we can dispense with their labor by making others overwork. When all these methods prove inadequate we have a war: we cause a number of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to explode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a combination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep alive the notion that a great deal of manual work must be the lot of the average man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Russia, owing to economic justice and central control over production, the problem will have to be differently solved. The rational solution would be as soon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for all to reduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to decide, at each stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be preferred. But, having taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult to see how the authorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much leisure and little work. It seems more likely that they will find continually fresh schemes by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future productivity. I read recently of an ingenious scheme put forward by Russian engineers for making the White Sea and the northern coasts of Siberia warm by putting a dam across the Kara Straits. An admirable plan, but liable to postpone proletarian comfort for a generation, while the nobility of toil is being displayed amid the ice-fields and snowstorms of the Arctic Ocean. This sort of thing, if it happens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of hard work as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in which it is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;III&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is necessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life. If it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We have been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping the poor contented, which has led the rich for thousands of years to preach the dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in this respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us delight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth√¢s surface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker. If you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to say, √¢I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man√¢s noblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his planet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill in as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can return to the toil from which my contentment springs.√¢ I have never heard working men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be considered, as a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure hours that they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be said that while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not know how to fill their days if they had only four hours√¢ work out of the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world it is a condemnation of our civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the habit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into crime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable, because it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the desirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-turvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you with bread are praiseworthy because they are making money but when you enjoy the food they have provided you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to get strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is good and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one transaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good but keyholes are bad. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose of his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce between the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profitmaking is the incentive to industry. We think too much of production and too little of consumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning to imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure frivolity. I mean that four hours√¢ work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time should be his to use as he might see fit. It is an essential part of any such social system that education should be carried farther than it usually is at present, and should aim, in part, at providing tastes which would enable a man to use leisure intelligently. I am not thinking mainly of the sort of things that would be considered √¢high-brow.√¢ Peasant dances have died out except in remote rural areas, but the impulses which caused them to be cultivated must still exist in human nature. The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past there was a small leisure class and a large working class. The leisure class enjoyed advantages for which there was no basis in social justice; this necessarily made it oppressive, limited its sympathies, and caused it to invent theories by which to justify its privileges. These facts greatly diminished its excellence, but in spite of this drawback it contributed nearly the whole of what we call civilization. It cultivated the arts and discovered the sciences; it wrote the books, invented the philosophies, and refined social relations. Even the liberation of the oppressed has usually been inaugurated from above. Without the leisure class mankind would never have emerged from barbarism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The method of a hereditary leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had been taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. It might produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and punishing poachers. At present, the universities are supposed to provide, in a more systematic way, what the leisure class provided accidentally and as a byproduct. This is a great improvement, but it has certain drawbacks. University life is so different from life in the world at large that men who live in an academic milieu tend to be unaware of the pre-occupations of ordinary men and women; moreover, their ways of expressing themselves are usually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that they ought to have upon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in universities studies are organized, and the man who thinks of some original line of research is likely to be discouraged. Academic institutions, therefore, useful as they are, are not adequate guardians of the interests of civilization in a world where every one outside their walls is too busy for unutilitarian pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures may be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by sensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence needed for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will have lost the taste and the capacity. Men who in their professional work have become interested in some phase of economics or government will be able to develop their ideas without the academic detachment that makes the work of university economists lacking in reality. Medical men will have time to learn about the progress of medicine. Teachers will not be exasperatedly struggling to teach by routine things which they learned in their youth, which may, in the interval, have been proved to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure delightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired in their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in professional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will not depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be unhampered, and there will be no need to conform to the standards set by elderly pundits. But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the advantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the opportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and less inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out, partly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe work for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen instead to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines. In this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish for ever.&lt;/p&gt;
