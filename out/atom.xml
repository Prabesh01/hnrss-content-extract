    &lt;p&gt;Adam Mastroianni is the author of Experimental History. He studies how people perceive and misperceive their social worlds. His work has been featured in Science, Nature, and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. He has a PhD in psychology from Harvard and a certificate of completion from 137 different escape rooms. He’s originally from Monroeville, Ohio (pop. 1,400) and currently lives in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a definition of intelligence that lots of psychologists can get behind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings-“catching on,” “making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do […] Intelligence, so defined, can be measured, and intelligence tests measure it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence sounds pretty great. Who doesn’t want to “catch on” and “make sense”? Hell, “figuring out” what to do is pretty much all of life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, people with more of this mental horsepower must live happier lives. When they encounter a problem, they should use their superior problem-solving ability to solve it. Smarter people should do a better job making plans and getting what they want, and they should learn more from their mistakes and subsequently make fewer of them. All of this should add up to a life that makes smart people go “this life rules!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So smarter people are happier, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, this meta-analysis says no. Another says maybe a teeny tiny bit. This large, nationally-representative study from the UK finds that people who score the lowest on an intelligence test are a little less happy than everyone else, but that’s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also pulled data from the General Social Survey, which includes (a) a short vocabulary test that seems to correlate reasonably well with longer intelligence tests (you can try it here), and (b) a simple measure of happiness: “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days—would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” Across 50 years of data and 30,346 people, the folks who scored higher on the vocab test were a tiny bit less happy (r = -.06, p &amp;lt; .001).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe our tests are bad. The psychological study of intelligence has a long, bleak history of racism and prejudice against poor people (“three generations of imbeciles are enough”), so we should be skeptical coming in. Psychologists have been trying to construct bias-free tests for a long time, but it’s hard. Plus, people score higher on IQ tests when you pay them for performance, so what looks like a test of intelligence may in part be a test of how hard you’re willing to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if intelligence tests only measure something like “ability to succeed in an unfair society” or “willingness to try hard,” it only deepens the mystery. Shouldn’t those people end up with happier lives, however unfair that may be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the tests likely do tap something more than just privilege and effort. There’s plenty of skepticism toward intelligence tests in psychology, but even the biggest skeptics agree that IQ can predict things like how well you do in school and what kind of job you get, even accounting for all the criticisms. So why doesn’t it also predict living a life that you like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;SPEARING SPEARMAN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there’s one guy to blame for this big mystery, and his name is Charles Spearman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Way back in 1904, Spearman noticed something weird: the same kids who did well in one subject in school tended to do well in other subjects, too. The correlations were never perfect, of course, but they were pretty darn high, even across subjects that seemed pretty different from each other, like French and math. How come?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spearman figured there must be some general mental ability that humans use to solve all kinds of problems. He later wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This continued tendency to success of the same person throughout all variations of both form and subject-matter—that is to say throughout all conscious aspects of cognition whatever—appears only explicable by some factor lying deeper than the phenomena of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helpfully, he also drew us a picture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, I think, exactly where everything went wrong with the study of intelligence for the next 119 years. It’s not that Spearman’s results were inaccurate—in fact, they’ve been replicated over and over. At this point, pretty much every paper on intelligence has to start out like this review from 2006:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the study of intelligence, one empirical phenomenon is well established: Test scores on cognitive tasks show a positive manifold, that is, they are invariably positively intercorrelated, albeit to varying degrees. This implies that people who score well on one cognitive test are likely to score well on other cognitive tests. The positive manifold is a robust phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spearman’s stats were sound, but his interpretation was wrong. He did not, as he claimed, observe a “continued tendency to success throughout all variations of both form and subject-matter,” nor has anybody else. It merely looks as if we’ve varied all the forms and the subject-matters because we have the wrong theory about what makes them different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think tests of math, vocabulary, French, music, etc. are all different because some are about words and others are about numbers and others are about sounds. But psychology, like all sciences, is all about discovering the differences between seemingly similar things, and discovering the similarities between seemingly different things. If psychologists ever had to march into battle, a good candidate for our crests may be the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, the two lines that look like they’re different lengths but aren’t:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like those lines, I think all of our various tests of intelligence aren’t as different as they seem. They’re all full of problems that have a few important things in common:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are stable relationships between the variables.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There’s no disagreement about whether the problems are problems, or whether they’ve been solved.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There have clear boundaries; there is a finite amount of relevant information and possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The problems are repeatable. Although the details may change, the process for solving the problems does not.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a good name for problems like these is well-defined. Well-defined problems can be very difficult, but they aren’t mystical. You can write down instructions for solving them. And you can put them on a test. In fact, standardized tests items must be well-defined problems, because they require indisputable answers. Matching a word to its synonym, finding the area of a trapezoid, putting pictures in the correct order—all common tasks on IQ tests—are well-defined problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spearman was right that people differ in their ability to solve well-defined problems. But he was wrong that well-defined problems are the only kind of problems. “Why can’t I find someone to spend my life with?” “Should I be a dentist or a dancer?” and “How do I get my child to stop crying?” are all important but poorly defined problems. “How can we all get along?” is not a multiple-choice question. Neither is “What do I do when my parents get old?” And getting better at rotating shapes or remembering state capitals is not going to help you solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all share some blame with Spearman, of course, because everybody talks about smarts as if they’re one thing. Google “smartest people in the world” and most of the results will be physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and chess masters. These are all difficult problems, but they are well-defined, and that makes it easy to rank people. The best chess player in the world is the one who can beat everybody else. The best mathematician is the one who can solve the problems that nobody else could solve. That makes it seem like the best chess players and mathematicians are not just the smartest in their fields, but the smartest in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;THE POORLY DEFINED PROBLEM OF BEING ALIVE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately no good word for “skill at solving poorly defined problems.” Insight, creativity, agency, self-knowledge—they’re all part of it, but not all of it. Wisdom comes the closest, but it suggests a certain fustiness and grandeur, and poorly defined problems aren’t just dramatic questions like “how do you live a good life”; they’re also everyday questions like “how do you host a good party” and “how do you figure out what to do today.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to spot people who are good at solving poorly defined problems is to look for people who feel good about their lives; “how do I live a life I like” is a humdinger of a poorly defined problem. The rules aren’t stable: what makes you happy may make me miserable. The boundaries aren’t clear: literally anything I do could make me more happy or less happy. The problems are not repeatable: what made me happy when I was 21 may not make me happy when I’m 31. Nobody else can be completely sure whether I’m happy or not, and sometimes I’m not even sure. In fact, some people might claim that I’m not really happy, no matter what I say, unless I accept Jesus into my heart or reach nirvana or fall in love—if I think I’m happy before all that, I’m simply mistaken about what happiness is!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why the people who score well on intelligence tests and win lots of chess games are no happier than the people who flunk the tests and lose at chess: well-defined and poorly defined problems require completely different problem-solving skills. Life ain’t chess! Nobody agrees on the rules, the pieces do whatever they want, and the board covers the whole globe, as well as the inside of your head and possibly several metaphysical planes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;IF YOU’RE SO SMART, WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s another way of looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you want to test people’s math ability. You design a test, administer it to a bunch of people, do all your psychometrics, etc. You’re feeling pretty good about your math test. And then you find that some of the people who ace your test later say things like “two plus two is 19” and “88 is the biggest number.” You’d feel pretty embarrassed about your math test because it’s clearly not measuring mathematical ability, if it’s measuring anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly the situation we’re in with tests that claim to measure people’s “reasoning” and “problem-solving ability.” Christopher Langan, a guy who can score eye-popping numbers on IQ tests, believes that 9/11 was an inside job meant specifically to distract the public from his theories, and he claims that banks won’t give him a loan because he’s white. John Sununu supposedly has IQ of 176, but he still had to resign from being George H.W. Bush’s chief of staff because he flew to his dentist appointments using military jets. Bobby Fischer is one of the greatest chess players of all time, but he also claimed that Hitler was a good dude, the Holocaust didn’t happen, and “Jews murder Christian children for their blood and they’re doing it even today.” Then there’s the ever-lengthening list of professors at elite universities who have been disciplined or dismissed for doing things like sexually harassing colleagues and students or completely making up data or hanging out with a known pedophile. These are supposed to be some of the smartest people in the world, endowed with exceptional problem-solving abilities. And yet they’re still unable to solve basic but poorly defined problems like “maintain a basic grip on reality” and “be a good person” and “don’t make any life-altering blunders.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GAZE UPON OUR WORKS AND DESPAIR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here’s another way of looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last generation, we have solved tons of well-defined problems. We eradicated smallpox and polio. We landed on the moon. We built better cars, refrigerators, and televisions. We even got ~15 IQ points smarter! And how did our incredible success make us feel?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that progress didn’t make us a bit happier. I think there’s an important lesson here: if solving a bunch of well-defined problems did not make our predecessors happier, it probably won’t make us happier, either. The barrier between you and everlasting bliss is probably not the size of your television, nor your ability to solve Raven’s Progressive Matrices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(To be clear, I still think it’s good we did all this. Polio sucks and going to the moon is awesome.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish we knew more about how to make that bright green line go up, but we just haven’t yet defined the problem of “living a happy life”. We know that if you’re starving, lonely, or in pain, you’ll probably get happier if you get food, friends, and relief. After that, the returns diminish very quickly. You could read all the positive psychology you want, take the online version of The Science of Wellbeing (”Yale’s Most Popular Course Ever!”), read my post on hacking the hedonic treadmill, meditate, exercise, and keep a gratitude journal—and after all that, maybe you’ll be a smidge happier. Whatever else you think will put a big, permanent smile on your face, you’re probably wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’re really looking for a transformative change in your happiness, you might be better off reading something ancient. The great thinkers of the distant past seemed obsessed with figuring out how to live good lives: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, Marcus Aurelius, St. Augustine, even up through Thoreau and Vivekananda. But at some point, this kind of stuff apparently fell out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And hey, maybe that’s because there’s just no more progress to make on the poorly defined problem of “how do we live.” But most well-defined problems were once defined poorly. For example, “how do we land on the moon” was a hopelessly poorly defined problem for most of human history. It only makes sense if you know that the moon is a big rock you can land on and not, say, a god floating in the sky. We slowly put some definitions around that problem, and then one day we sent an actual dude to the moon and he walked around and was like “I’m on the moon now.” If we can do that, maybe we can also figure out how to live good lives. It certainly seems worth it to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;BUT AREN’T THERE MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not the first to propose that “general” intelligence is more than one thing. Pretty much as soon as Spearman started claiming that intelligence is mainly one thing, other people started saying that intelligence is actually many things. (That’s science, baby!) Today, the most popular version of this theory claims there’s something like eight intelligences, ranging from “visual-spatial” to “bodily-kinesthetic.” I’m sympathetic to this take because it tries to account for all the different weird and wonderful things that humans can do. But it’s got two big problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem #1: People very rarely try to find any evidence for it. And when they do, they find that the people who score high on one of the many intelligences tend to score high on the others, too, just as Spearman would’ve predicted a hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problem #2: When you label every human activity as its own intelligence, you give up any hope of understanding anything about the structure of problems in the world or how people solve them. We can make up whatever categories we want; they aren’t given by God. The only reason to use some categories and not others is that some categories are useful and others aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, we could have created a periodic table that organized the elements alphabetically, or by color, or by how good they taste. Instead we organize them by atomic number, not because it’s their “true” order, but because it’s useful. It helps us realize things like, “Hey, we’ve got a number 62 and a number 64—I wonder if there’s a number 63 out there. We should go looking for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we should pick the way of categorizing intelligence that gives us the most bang for our buck. “Intelligence is many things” can’t explain why people perform similarly across supposedly different tests, and “intelligence is mostly one thing” can’t answer a basic question like “why smart people aren’t happier?” But we can handle both of those challenges when we split intelligence into skill at solving well-defined and poorly defined problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s not all we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;OH BOY HERE COMES THE PART ABOUT AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People think of AI as a big glob of problem-solving ability. If you make the glob bigger, it can solve harder problems. That’s certainly been true so far: gigantic globs of AI can now drive cars, defeat our greatest chess players, and predict how proteins will fold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this has happened very quickly, which may make it seem like we’re careening toward a “general” artificial intelligence that can do all the things humans can. But if you split problems into well-defined and poorly defined, you’ll notice that all of AI’s progress has been on defined problems. That’s what artificial intelligence does. In order to get AI to solve a problem, we have to give it data to learn from, and picking that data requires defining the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean the problems AI has solved so far are stupid or trivial. They’re really important and interesting! They’re just all well-defined problems. And we should expect that pattern to continue: for any well-defined problem, AI will eventually outperform humans. But for poorly defined problems, AI is hopeless. To solve those, we need humans running around doing weird human stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about GPT-3—it can write movie scripts! And what about DALLE-2—it can paint pictures!” These AIs perform a clever trick: they make it seem like they’re solving poorly defined problems when, under the hood, they’re really solving well-defined problems. GPT-3 doesn’t actually write movie scripts; it predicts what words should come next. DALLE-2 doesn’t actually paint pictures; it matches words to images. These problems aren’t easy to solve—that’s why you need such a big glob of AI. But they obey clear, unchanging rules, they have bright boundaries, and you know precisely when you’ve solved them. They are well-defined problems. (This is also why AI art isn’t art).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you booted up a super-smart AI in ancient Greece, fed it all human knowledge, and asked it how to land on the moon, it would respond “You can’t land on the moon. The moon is a god floating in the sky.” How would you get it to realize the moon is actually a big rock? That’s a great, poorly defined problem, and I don’t expect AI to solve it anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;SHOUTOUT TO MY GRANDMA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s one last advantage of dividing intelligence into well-defined problem-solving and poorly defined problem-solving: it reminds us to give some respect where respect is due.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve got no problem fawning over people who are good at solving well-defined problems. They get to be called “professor” and “doctor.” We pay them lots of money to teach us stuff. They get to join exclusive clubs like Mensa and the Prometheus Society. (By the way, Mensa’s page explaining IQ doesn’t mention anything about the dark history of using intelligence tests to hurt people, and you might expect a bunch of smarty-pantses to, you know, use their brains to discuss things with a bit more nuance. But what do I know, I’m just a big dummy.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who are good at solving poorly defined problems don’t get the same kind of kudos. They don’t get any special titles or clubs. There is no test they can take that will spit out a big, honking number that will make everybody respect them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s a shame. My grandma does not know how to use the “input” button on her TV’s remote control, but she does know how to raise a family full of good people who love each other, how to carry on through a tragedy, and how to make the perfect pumpkin pie. We sometimes condescendingly refer to this kind of wisdom as “folksy” or “homespun,” as if answering multiple-choice questions is real intelligence, and living a good, full life is just some down-home, gee-whiz, cutesy thing that little old ladies do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excluding this kind of intelligence from our definitions doesn’t just hurt our grandmas—it hurts us too. If you don’t value the ability to solve poorly defined problems, you’ll never get more of it. You won’t seek out people who have that ability and try to learn from them, nor will you listen to them when they have something important to say. You’ll spend your whole life trying to solve problems with cleverness when what you really need is wisdom. And you’ll wonder why it never really seems to work. All of your optimizing, your straining to achieve and advance, your ruthless crusade to eliminate all of the well-defined problems from your life—it doesn’t actually seem make your life any better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re stuck trying to solve poorly defined problems with your slick, well-defined problem-solving skills and you’re lucky enough to have a grandma like mine still on this Earth, my god, go see her. Shut up and listen to her for a while. And once you’ve learned something, maybe ask her if she needs help with her TV.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And if you’re not, you will understand the table by the end of this article!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s SIMD? Why SIMD?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware that does arithmetic is cheap, so any CPU made this century has plenty of it. But you still only have one instruction decoding block and it is hard to get it to go fast, so the arithmetic hardware is vastly underutilized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get around the instruction decoding bottleneck, you can feed the CPU a batch of numbers all at once for a single arithmetic operation like addition. Hence the name: “single instruction, multiple data,” or SIMD for short.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of adding two numbers together, you can add two batches or “vectors” of numbers and it takes about the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On recent x86 chips these batches can be up to 512 bits in size, so in theory you can get an 8x speedup for math on &lt;code&gt;u64&lt;/code&gt; or a 64x speedup on &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Instruction sets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, SIMD instructions were added after the CPU architecture was already designed, so SIMD is an extension with its own marketing name on each architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ARM calls theirs “NEON”, and all 64-bit ARM CPUs have it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebAssembly doesn’t have a marketing department, so they just call theirs “WebAssembly 128-bit packed SIMD extension”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;64-bit x86 shipped with one called “SSE2” which has basic instructions for 128-bit vectors, but later they added a whole menagerie of extensions on top of that, with SSE 4.2 adding more operations, AVX and AVX2 adding 256-bit vectors and AVX-512 adding 512-bit vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The word “later” in the above paragraph creates a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does this CPU have that instruction?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re running a program on an x86 CPU, it’s not a given that the CPU has any particular SIMD extension. So by default the compiler isn’t allowed to use instructions beyond SSE2 because that won’t work on all x86 CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two ways around this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you work for a company that only ever runs their binaries on their own servers or on a public cloud, you can just assert that they’re all recent enough to at least have AVX2 that was introduced over 10 years ago, and have the program crash or misbehave if it ever runs on anything without AVX2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=x86–64-v3' cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you are distributing the binaries for other people to run, that’s not really an option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead you can do something called function multiversioning: compile the same function multiple times for different SIMD extensions, and when the program actually runs, check what features the CPU supports and select the appropriate version based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this problem only exists on x86.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ARM made its NEON mandatory in all 64-bit CPUs and then didn’t bother expanding the width beyond 128 bits. (Technically SVE exists, but in 2025 it is still mostly on paper, and Rust support for it is still in progress).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebAssembly makes you compile two different binaries, one with SIMD and one without, and use JavaScript to check if the browser supports SIMD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Solution space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are four approaches to SIMD in Rust, in ascending order of effort:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic vectorization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fancy iterators&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Portable SIMD abstractions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Raw intrinsics&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Automatic vectorization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easiest approach to SIMD is letting the compiler do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works surprisingly well, as long as you structure your code in a way that is amenable to vectorization. This article covers it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can check if it’s working with cargo-show-asm or godbolt.org, but your benchmarks are the ultimate judge of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly there is a limit on the complexity of the code that the compiler will vectorize, and it may change between compiler versions. If something vectorizes today that doesn’t necessarily mean it still will in a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other drawback of this method is that the optimizer won’t even touch anything involving floats (&lt;code&gt;f32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f64&lt;/code&gt; types). It’s not permitted to change any observable outputs of the program, and reordering float operations may alter the result due to precision loss. (There is a way to tell the compiler not to worry about precision loss, but it’s currently nightly-only).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So right now, if you need to process floats, autovectorization is a no-go unless you can use nightly builds of the Rust compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Floats are cursed even without SIMD. Something as simple as summing an array of them in a usable way turns out to be really hard).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no built-in way to multiversion functions, but the multiversion crate works great with autovectorization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fancy iterators&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like rayon lets you run your iterators in parallel by swapping &lt;code&gt;.iter()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;.par_iter()&lt;/code&gt;, there have been attempts to do the same for SIMD. After all, what is SIMD but another kind of parallelism?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the approach that the faster crate takes. That crate has been abandoned for years, and it doesn’t look like this approach has panned out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Portable SIMD abstractions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to let you write your algorithm by explicitly operating on chunks of data, something like &lt;code&gt;[f32; 8]&lt;/code&gt; but wrapped in a custom type, and then provide custom implementations of operations like &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that compile down into SIMD instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::simd&lt;/code&gt; is exactly that. It supports all instruction sets LLVM supports, so its platform support is unparalleled. It pairs well with the multiversion crate. Sadly it’s nightly-only and will remain such for the foreseeable future, so it’s unusable in most situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wide crate is a mature, established option. It supports NEON, WASM and all the x86 instruction sets. But it doesn’t support multiversioning at all, save for very exotic and limited approaches like cargo-multivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pulp crate is a great design with built-in multiversioning, and is reasonably mature and complete, if not as much as &lt;code&gt;wide&lt;/code&gt;. It powers faer, so its performance is clearly proven. A major limitation is that it only operates on the native SIMD width, so you need your code to be able to handle variable width chunks as opposed to expressing everything in terms of something like &lt;code&gt;[f32; 8]&lt;/code&gt; and letting the library lower it into the appropriate instructions like &lt;code&gt;std::simd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wide&lt;/code&gt; do. The architecture support is also limited — only NEON, AVX2 and AVX-512. But AVX2 was introduced in 2012 and in the Steam hardware survey 95% systems have it, so that might not be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The macerator crate is a fork of pulp with vastly expanded instruction set support. It supports all x86 extensions, WASM, NEON, and even the LoongArch SIMD extensions. It’s used only by burn-ndarray, and even there it’s an optional dependency. It sounds great on paper, but it’s oddly obscure and therefore unproven. I’d probably write code using pulp, then replace it with macerator and see if everything still works and runs as fast as it should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fearless_simd crate is inspired by pulp’s design, but also supports fixed-size chunks just like &lt;code&gt;std::simd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wide&lt;/code&gt;. It’s far less mature than pulp, but it’s under active development. As of this writing it supports NEON, WASM and SSE4.2, but not the newer x86 extensions. Seems too immature just yet, but something to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;simdeez is a rather old crate that supports all instruction sets except AVX-512 and comes with built-in multiversioning. What gives me pause is that despite existing for many years, it’s still barely used. Everyone else who needed SIMD built their own instead of using it. And its README says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Currently things are well fleshed out for i32, i64, f32, and f64 types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I guess the other types aren’t complete?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: use &lt;code&gt;std::simd&lt;/code&gt; if you don’t mind nightly, &lt;code&gt;wide&lt;/code&gt; if you don’t need multiversioning, and otherwise &lt;code&gt;pulp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;macerator&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it’s not 2025 when you’re reading this, check out &lt;code&gt;fearless_simd&lt;/code&gt;, because &lt;code&gt;std::simd&lt;/code&gt; is still in nightly in your glorious future, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Raw intrinsics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to get really close to the metal, there are always the raw intrinsics, just one step removed from the processor instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem looming over any use of raw intrinsics is that you have to manually write them for every platform and instruction set you’re targeting. Whereas &lt;code&gt;std::simd&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;wide&lt;/code&gt; let you write your logic once and compile it down to the assembly automatically, with intrinsics you have to write a separate implementation for every single platform and instruction set (SSE, AVX, NEON…) you care to support. That’s a lot of code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s really not helped by the fact that they are all named something like &lt;code&gt;_mm256_srli_epi32&lt;/code&gt; and your code ends up as a long list of calls to these arcanely named functions. And wrappers that help readability introduce their own problems, such as clashes with multiversioning or unsafe code or arcane macros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also have to build your own multiversioning. Or rather, you have to manually dispatch to the dedicated implementation you have manually written for each instruction set. &lt;code&gt;std::is_x86_feature_detected!&lt;/code&gt; macro takes care of the feature detection, but it is somewhat slow. In some cases it is beneficial to detect available features exactly once and then cache the results, but you have to implement that manually too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the bright side, this year writing intrinsics got markedly less awful. Most of them are no longer &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; to call in Rust 1.86 and later, and the safe_unaligned_simd crate provides safe wrappers for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So at least this approach is no longer &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; on top of all the other problems it has!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Which one is right for you?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The right tool for the job ultimately depends on the use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want zero dependencies and little up-front hassle? Autovectorization. Porting existing C code or targeting very specific hardware? Intrinsics. Anything else? Portable SIMD abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now that you made it this far, you can understand the table at the top of the article, which will help guide your decision!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;Tuesday, 04 November 2025&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new material has been used to create a gel that can repair and regenerate tooth enamel, opening up new possibilities for effective and long-lasting preventive and restorative dental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Nottingham’s School of Pharmacy and Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, in collaboration with an international team of researchers, have developed a bioinspired material that has the potential to regenerate demineralized or eroded enamel, strengthen healthy enamel, and prevent future decay. The findings have been published today in Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gel can be rapidly applied to teeth in the same way dentists currently apply standard fluoride treatments. However, this new protein-based gel is fluoride free and works by mimicking key features of the natural proteins that guide the growth of dental enamel in infancy. When applied, the gel creates a thin and robust layer that impregnates teeth, filling holes and cracks in them. It then functions as a scaffold that takes calcium and phosphate ions from saliva and promotes the controlled growth of new mineral in a process called epitaxial mineralization. This enables the new mineral to be organized and integrated to the underlying natural tissue while recovering both the structure and properties of natural healthy enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new material can also be applied on top of exposed dentine, growing an enamel-like layer on top of dentine, which has many benefits including treating hypersensitivity or enhancing the bonding of dental restorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enamel degradation is a major contributor to tooth decay and is associated to dental problems affecting almost 50% of the world’s population. These problems can lead to infections and tooth loss, and can also be associated with conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Enamel does not naturally regenerate; once you lose it is gone forever. There is currently no solution available that can effectively regrow enamel. Current treatments such as fluoride varnishes and remineralisation solutions only alleviate the symptoms of lost enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Abshar Hasan, a Postdoctoral Fellow and leading author of the study, said: “Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical, and thermal insults. When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt; We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating ‘real-life situations’ such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods, and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel. &lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt; We are very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable. Also, the technology is versatile, which opens the opportunity to be translated into multiple types of products to help patients of all ages suffering from a variety of dental problems associated with loss of enamel and exposed dentine. We have started this process with our start-up company Mintech-Bio and hope to have a first product out next year; this innovation could soon be helping patients worldwide. &lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Story credits&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information is available from Professor Alvaro Mata on Alvaro.Mata@nottingham.ac.uk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranked 97 in the world and 17th in the UK by the QS World University Rankings, the University of Nottingham is a founding member of Russell Group of research-intensive universities.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recursive macros in C, demystified (once the ugly crying stops 😭)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In which it becomes clear, the C Preprocessor was designed by &lt;del&gt;a&lt;/del&gt; Kafka &lt;del&gt;fan&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you have heard rumors whispered between peers, that a rare few people somehow manage to make compile-time recursion work in C? And you want to have some insight into how that might be possible??&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should warn you, you’re risking your sanity… but I’ll indulge you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, did I really just say that? I must be a glutton for punishment, because the macro system is, by far, the thing I like least about C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C has many advantages that have led to its longevity (60 years as perhaps the most important language). It has many quirks due to its age, most of which are easy to look past. But despite 30 years writing C, I still bristle at C’s macro system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not just because there are many languages (including C++) with more modern takes on compile-time execution. Macros appear simple, but have subtleties that make them poorly suited for anything other than light wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, being C’s only compile-time execution capability (currently), it is still both critical and important. Critical, in that many venerable critical systems heavily depend on them, and wouldn’t compile without them. Important, in that it’s often the only way to abstract out complexity that would lead to safety or security issues if exposed, such as automatically adding sentinels or static type checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C macros being hard to use does discourage their overuse. It’s easy for too much abstraction to make it too difficult for other people to maintain the code, so in some ways, as painful as they are, I can find some things to appreciate, and do occasionally find reason to use them for something non-trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t take much for a macro to be non-trivial, because, while C macros can look like functions, they cannot be called recursively (at least, not easily, as we will see).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never been able to find out why recursion is limited in C macros. It could have started off intentional, but compile time execution wasn’t really on people’s minds then; the challenge was abstracting over many platform differences as cheaply as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect the system evolved as needed in the early days, without really thinking about it as something that perhaps should support recursion. Certainly at some point, the question would get raised; but it’s easy to imagine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The organic evolution of the macro system coupled with early success made it brittle, and hard to evolve.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;People were worried about build issues like hanging compile times due to infinite loops, or crashing with no diagnostics, due to infinite recursion.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on which of these two was more prominent, I could equally imagine the lack of recursion being an accident, or being an intentional choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However it happened, that die was cast in a completely different era—people have definitely woken up to the value of pushing as much into compile time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either way, it all seems archaic and unnecessary now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, let’s roll up our sleeves and learn to cope with the issue!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Motivation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have anything interesting you need done with the preprocessor, you probably need to generalize over multiple items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you want to add automatic sanity checks around parameters, or add automatic type checking. You might want to pre-fill arrays, or generate a list of functions based on some data. Generally, we should be able to do such things at compile time, and in cases like type checking, it is often incredibly challenging to defer the work till runtime. So the lack of a good compile time solution for such things is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tend to reach for macros when they can remove the potential for human error; for example, calling an API wrong. That can indeed be adding automatic casts, enforcing that null terminators get added on variable argument arrays, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all of those scenarios, we would need something to move macros toward Turing completeness at compile time. But macros do not advertise support for either of the things we’d be looking for there: iteration, and recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we can get there. But it’s not going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To frame our discussion, let’s pick a simple, but highly valuable goal. We’re going to build a macro that counts the number of variable arguments in a function-like macro that accepts variable arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why that problem? Because from there it’s a short jump to dealing with some common issues, where we can remove large sources of human error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Variadic functions (aka varargs) are error prone, because the implementation has to figure out where the arguments stop; the language doesn’t give you a way to know. The caller has to remember to follow your convention (like adding a null terminator). And that convention can often back fire, for example, when a null value is a valid argument . Being able to count the number of variadic arguments allows us to provide a single, general approach to dealing with this, and to not put the burden on the caller to have to count correctly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are plenty of cases where we’d want to apply a transformation to each argument of a variable argument function, like statically checking that parameters are all the same type, or automatically adding a layer of sanity checking to a third party API, so that the people calling your function can remain blissfully unaware. These don’t directly require counting, but once we can count recursively, it’s a small change to give ourselves a more general purpose &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;construct to make such transformations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be surprised that the language doesn’t provide a way to count variable arguments in a macro, especially if you noticed the recent addition of a pre-defined macro called &lt;code&gt;__COUNTER__&lt;/code&gt; in the draft C2Y standard. The new &lt;code&gt;__COUNTER__&lt;/code&gt; macro is intended to make it easier to provide uniqueness for situations where macros need to generate identifiers and labels; it definitely isn’t for counting variadic macro arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apparently math is hard?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s no primitive to count variadic macro arguments, well, we need to create one, right? And if we have to create one, that means it should be pretty easy, one would hope?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;🦗🦗🦗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see you’re skeptical. But an optimist who wanted to delve into compile-time coding in C for the first time might give it a go. But they will quickly find that the obvious approach below, that feels like it should work, absolutely does not work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// The first macro... counts one argument, then we'd like it to recurse.
#define _COUNT_ONE(x, ...) + 1 _COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__)
#define _COUNT_TOP(...)    __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_ONE(__VA_ARGS__))
#define COUNT(...)        (_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) + 0)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to call this code, and…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;🤮&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yup, it’ll barf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this doe-eyed attempt is trying to do, is generate an expression (at compile time) of the form &lt;code&gt;(+ 1 + 1 + … + 0)&lt;/code&gt;, by iterating over each argument at a call site (via recursion). It doesn’t care what the arguments are, it just wants to generate a &lt;code&gt;+ 1&lt;/code&gt; for each valid argument, and a &lt;code&gt;+ 0&lt;/code&gt; at the end, both to make it a valid expression and to handle the case where there are no arguments passed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we’re successful, the addition will all happen at compile time, and will be what C calls an integer constant expression. That means, the compiler will, at compile time, fold this into a single static integer. So, even if it feels inefficient, there is no run-time cost involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why three macros? That seems a bit excessive, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, C currently doesn’t have an easy way to do the equivalent of an &lt;code&gt;if()&lt;/code&gt; statement at compile time. It’s possible to create something with macros, but that’s just extra hackery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we split the primary body into its own macro— &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt;, which adds the &lt;code&gt;1 +&lt;/code&gt; and then triggers recursion (we wish, anyway; again, the recursion part won’t work this easily).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intent the behind &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt; macro is evaluating an exit condition for our recursion. Specifically, we want to stop when we have no more arguments left in the function. The builtin macro &lt;code&gt;__VA_OPT__()&lt;/code&gt; allows us to do exactly that— the text inside the parentheses gets expanded only if there are arguments. And when there are no arguments, the text inside the parentheses is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us a lightweight way to separate the one argument case from the two argument case, without need for a kind of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement; the 0-case won’t generate a recursive call. To combine this with &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt;, we’d need a primitive that allowed us to specify a replacement that only expands when there are no arguments, which doesn’t come out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outer &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; macro could be factored out trivially; I leave it because it keeps what’s going on a bit clearer. This macro is the actual entry point, adds the ‘0’ a single time the end, and wraps the whole thing in parentheses, which helps avoid running afoul of operator precedence rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we directly combine it with &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt; in the obvious way, it would compute the right thing, but it would do it by adding the &lt;code&gt;+ 0&lt;/code&gt; after EVERY term, and parenthesizing the expression in a way that would come off as odd if you were looking at the resulting C code. For instance, we’d be aiming for a three argument function to generate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;( + 1 ( + 1 ( + 1 ( + 0 ) + 0 ) + 0 ) + 0 )&lt;/code&gt;
If we were to generate this code, it’d be ugly, but most people would declare success and move on. But unfortunately, the above code does not work, and will never work, no matter how many iterations of the standard are released between now and the heat death of the universe— changing the behavior would be too likely to impact plenty of real code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, let’s attempt to use the above implementation like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int
main()
{
    printf("COUNT() = %d\n", COUNT(1, 2, 3));
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt;, I get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tmp.c:8:30: error: expected ')'
    8 |     printf("COUNT() = %d\n", COUNT(1, 2, 3));

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, that’s a lot of error messages, saying little that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure you can already get the feeling that, when you have a problem with your macros, it’s incredibly challenging to translate the resulting errors into what’s actually wrong. Here, it’s complaining about balancing parentheses, and with just a bit more complexity in our macros, it’d be incredibly easy for someone to spend 10 minutes trying to figure out where the parenthesis is missing, when no parenthesis is missing whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, we could have taken advantage of the fact that C is perfectly happy to accept &lt;code&gt;+ + 0&lt;/code&gt;, and write &lt;code&gt;1 +&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;+ 1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making that microscopic change, merely transposing two tokens, completely changes the error &lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt; produces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tmp.c:8:30: error: call to undeclared function '_COUNT_TOP'; ISO C99 and later do not support implicit function declarations [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   8 |     printf("COUNT() = %d\n", COUNT(1, 2, 3));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey, at least that message is concise. Never mind that it’s totally different, and also unrelated to the real issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Not counting on it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The C Preprocessor (which I will usually call CPP) is responsible for macro expansion and processing lines with a leading &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. As we’ve said, it does not fully support recursion. As you might expect, that’s the core of the actual problem in our first attempt. Yet, the preprocessor happily thinks it did its job. We’ll see in more detail what’s going on, but the crux of this particular problem is how recursion is disallowed, not that it IS disallowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem here is that C macros are their own programming language, being used to generate C code. The macro language doesn’t model most of the interesting parts of the language, and it is quite easy to produce code that the preprocessor finds acceptable, that the compiler cannot understand (as we will see).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In both these cases, the preprocessor feels like it’s done its job, and passes off its work to the C compiler. The C compiler gets the generated code, and has no idea that macros were used. It calls the error as it sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This disconnect between the preprocessor and the compiler is one of the things that makes macros in C so unfriendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a macro expansion (basically the same as an ‘evaluation’) is recursive, the CPP decides “they can’t possibly have wanted recursion here, because that might loop forever, so this must be plain old text I have to substitute”. As a result, the emitted code will still contain the unexpanded macro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can we confirm this? If we can’t understand the resulting transformations, we’re going to end up stumbling around in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many developers don’t know how to see what the C preprocessor actually produces. If the preprocessor successfully exits, we can see it’s output by stopping the compiler after the preprocessing phase, generally with the &lt;code&gt;-E&lt;/code&gt; flag. If we don’t give a file name (via the &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; flag), we should see the results on the terminal. And at least in the case of &lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt;, we will even get output up to the point that we did something so wrong that the preprocessor gives us an error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the code above, running &lt;code&gt;cc -E tmp.c&lt;/code&gt; works without errors, and dumps the output of CPP to my terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That consists of a lot of stuff you might not expect to see. The output contains our code after the preprocessor has fully expanded it. But that full expansion includes the results of it preprocessing all of the header files we pulled in, which in our case was &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt;, and any cascading dependencies it might have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, our code is easy to find in that noise. The last thing output will be our fully translated &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function, ready to be input into the C compiler. For the case where we add &lt;code&gt;+1&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of the macro, we will see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int
main()
{
    printf("COUNT() = %d\n", (+1 _COUNT_TOP(2, 3) + 0));
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the compiler doesn’t have to try to look up the symbol &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP&lt;/code&gt;; it knows that it doesn’t make sense to have a function call after a number with no operator in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we reverse the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, the line of code is valid, as long as there’s a function C can resolve called &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP&lt;/code&gt;. Because there isn’t, the compiler bails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That explains why we get two different errors, for such a minor change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because CPP and the compiler itself are oblivious to the execution of the other, and because we have to live with the fact that recursive macros aren’t errors to the CPP (silently passing them through unexpanded), it’s quite a bit of work for any compiler to even try to tell you that your problem here is attempting to use recursion in a macro. It could be done, and maybe it should be done, because otherwise, compilers are effectively trying to gaslight you into believing you have a syntax error of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the preprocessor is much more permissive than the compiler, without the compiler having any awareness of macros even existing is perhaps the most significant reason why writing non-trivial macros is so hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, we can hack our way around the recursion problem. The semantics are arcane and intricate enough that, even knowing the rules (and doing macro work with a copy of the standard at the ready), macro development is incredibly challenging the second you have any problem at all. Decades later, I often feel like I’m stumbling around in the dark when a macro I write blows up on me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this is all too intimidating, absolutely we can plagiarize our way to success. Though, personally, I really prefer not to cut-and-paste code from Stack Overflow, especially if it’s code I don’t understand. Similarly, while Claude and I are casual acquaintances, I do not trust his code. It’s my unwillingness to using code I don’t understand in production that keeps me learning and growing. Instead, I avoid non-trivial macros, unless (as I said above), I make an exception when they will be a huge net positive for helping the developer, usually by removing potential failure modes, or with significant clarity improvements. Meaning, if you can use them to provide an abstraction that makes the code more robust, and is also not going to be hard to maintain if the need arises, then I’d consider it (even if you have to get Claude to write it). Here, automating size detection statically feels like a good enough use case for my tastes, because macros will not only make variadic functions easier to write, but also make it far easier to call them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I’d like to help those interested understand how to navigate through the pain, and shine a light on it, in the hopes that this is another area of the language that the modern standards committee can make massively better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;That doesn’t count&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we want to know how to circumvent the recursion restriction, we probably need to understand the detection mechanism we are attempting to evade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sure would be nice if we could debug by having our compiler give us intermediate expansions, up until the point that it breaks. This is not directly built into any compiler as far as I know. And my experience with macro debuggers has been that they have a hard time matching compiler semantics. I dusted one of them off when working on this article, and it was easy to get it to expand macros as valid that CPP barfed on, and vice versa. Despite the lack of tooling, I’ll walk through the expansion process in detail so we can all understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rules for C macro evaluation are hard to explain in a way that’s simultaneously precise and clear. But for function-like macros, the main process of evaluating a macro boils down to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replace the macro text. Stashing aside the arguments used to call the macro, we replace the full macro with the textual body, within the larger token stream we’re processing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add placeholder tokens. Instances of ‘arguments’ in the body get replaced with placeholder tokens, to prevent them from being evaluated as macros in any nested argument expansion we might have. This includes &lt;code&gt;__VA_ARGS__&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;__VA_OPT__()&lt;/code&gt;invocations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Evaluate preprocessor operators in the body that take operands , particularly &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;. We don’t make good use of these operators in this article, so we won’t cover in too much depth. Note, however, that&lt;code&gt;__VA_OPT__()&lt;/code&gt;is also a preprocessor operator that takes arguments. We inhibited expansion within the replacement text, when we were evaluating operators, but at the end of this phase, we put it back; it can get expanded in the next step.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rescanning the body. The body is then scanned for more macros to expand, starting from our cursor in the token stream. The “input” head moves forward a token at a time, until we mind a macro to expand, or reach the end of the macro we’re evaluating. When we find a macro to expand, we recursively apply the algorithm.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some pretty large subtleties here. As long as a macro invocation starts in the scope of a rescan, the scanning head position can move past the end of the original macro. For example, consider this basic scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define CONCAT(X, Y)  X ## Y

int PRINT_INT = 100;

int
main()
{
    printf("%d\n", CONCAT(PRINT_, INT));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt; operator, seen used in the &lt;code&gt;CONCAT&lt;/code&gt; macro, appends two tokens together, turning them into a single preprocessor token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the preprocessor evaluates &lt;code&gt;CONCAT()&lt;/code&gt;, it will result in the token &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt; were a macro, the preprocessor would do further expansion. But it is not, so the preprocessor outputs &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt;. The C compiler does not complain, because it sees a variable named &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, depending on your background, the semantics may or may not being intuitive. But either way, what do you think should happen in this slightly more complex scenario?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define CONCAT(X, Y)  X ## Y

#define PRINT_INT(N)  printf("look an integer %d\n", (N));

int PRINT_INT = 100;

int
main()
{
    printf("%d\n", CONCAT(PRINT_, INT));
    CONCAT(PRINT_,INT)(100);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be reasonable to think there’s an error here, but this code will compile and run. Why? In both cases, the preprocessor will generate the token &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt;. In the first case, everything will happen the same way it did in our first example, and the compiler will see the variable &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, with the second use of &lt;code&gt;CONCAT&lt;/code&gt;, the preprocessor will see that there is a parenthesis immediately following the token &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt;. Since it has a function-like macro with that name, it will prefer the macro interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s true, even though we didn’t directly write &lt;code&gt;PRINT_INT&lt;/code&gt; in the code, there. The effective result of the preprocessor’s expansion would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define CONCAT(X, Y)  X ## Y

#define PRINT_INT(N)  printf("look an integer %d\n", (N));

int PRINT_INT = 100;

int
main()
{
    printf("%d\n", 100);
    printf("look an integer %d\n", 100);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s because C’s macros come in two flavors, with slightly different semantics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Function-like macros, which take arguments, and syntactically LOOK like functions. As we see here, if the preprocessor sees a token with the same name as a function like macro, but it’s not used like a function like macro, it will pass it through, letting the C compiler resolve the token.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Object-like macros, the definitions of which look like variables, and do not take arguments. If the C preprocessor sees a left parenthesis after an object-like macro, that token will just be passed through directly to the compiler.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why the following code does NOT error. In fact, it runs quite happily:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define OBJECT_LIKE_MACRO printf
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
int main()
{
  OBJECT_LIKE_MACRO("Hello, world!\n");
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meaning, if we we have an object-like macro and it looks like we’re trying to call it, the C preprocessor isn’t going to call it. It’s just going to pass the token through, and let the compiler figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the preprocessor’s philosophy is to do its job, and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another preprocessor subtlety that’s easy to miss, yet important to understand is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ℹ️️&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Arguments to function-like macros are expanded at the call site. For expansions that trigger inside the body where those arguments are used, the contents of the expanded arguments will not be available to be part of any additional expansion.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The preprocessor’s approach of substituting arguments with placeholder tokens during evaluation is pretty effective at stopping a bunch of accidental recursion that would be non-intuitive. Although, it’s not the problem for the recursion we’re trying to solve. The barrier we’re hitting is a subtlety that we haven’t discussed yet, but we’ll get to it soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before that, let’s solidify our understanding by walking through the relevant steps with our invocation of &lt;code&gt;COUNT(1)&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve learned that, when &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; has an invocation of &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt;, the replacement text cannot lead to recursion. The expansion endures the rescan, and nothing attempts to expand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rule that’s preventing the expansion is effectively an explicit anti-recursion rule. Formally, when we replace a macro, that macro is marked as currently being replaced. The mark stays, until that replacement is totally finished, including its rescan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, unfortunately, marked macros are ineligible for replacement. Note the rescan ineligibility is IN THE CALLING ENVIRONMENT. That’s going to cause us some grief in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, the original C89 standards committee referred to a macro marked as ineligible for expansion as painted blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❓&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Why the term painted blue? Perhaps the standards committee at the time realized how miserable it was going to make future C developers? It’s not a term mentioned in the standard, but is often used when people try to explain the whole process.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I’m blue, because I can’t count on you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can work around the problem, despite there being no way in C to opt out of your macro getting painted blue. But the work-around is going to be hard fought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s give ourselves a cause to be optimistic: the restriction that’s preventing &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt; from recursively expanding is relaxed when the second &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt; gets replaced. If, instead, the restriction stayed in full force the entire time we’ve evaluating &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt;, then you would not be able to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#define H4X(x) # x // convert to string
#define DUPE(token) H4X(token) H4X(token)

int 
main() {
    printf("%s\n", DUPE(h4x0r));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that will absolutely work. The preprocessor will output exactly what I intended:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int
main()
{
    printf("%s\n", "h4x0r" "h4x0r");
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In C, two string literals next to each other are merged into a single literal at compile time, so this program prints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;h4x0rh4x0r
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads us to believe that the blue paint wears off when the rescan moves past an expanded macro, after we’ve processed its replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So our hypothesis right now might be that &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt; expanding inside &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; is fine, as long as it happens after the processing head moves past the start of where the macro was, after expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, then all we need to do now is add another layer of indirection, right? Let the calling macro evaluate its recursive call on rescan!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would make sense! We’ll rewrite our attempt at recursion to add a proxy layer to call &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt;, knowing it cannot re-expand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_ONE(x, ...) + 1 _COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__)
#define _COUNT_TOP(...)    __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_ONE(__VA_ARGS__))
#define _COUNT_PROXY(...)  (_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) + 0)
#define COUNT(...)         _COUNT_PROXY(__VA_ARGS__)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d now expect the replacement when our evaluation gets back up to &lt;code&gt;COUNT(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt; to look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(+1 _COUNT_TOP(2, 3) + 0))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now, we’re thinking that escaped the paint, and &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt; will further expand, right? 🦗🦗🦗&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s time to shatter our youthful optimism with the bitter pill of experience. Yes, we’ve added an extra indirection, but here’s what it expands to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(+1 _COUNT_TOP(2, 3) + 0))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🤯&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the same as our intermediate expansion, but nothing further was done to the macro! I thought we made our way past the paint?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, there are subtleties to the rules somewhere. Clearly, the author is a jerk, and must have intentionally failed to mention it above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s true I am a jerk, and it’s also true that I failed to mention the restriction that’s biting us right now. That’s because it’s a part of the journey— no tutorial or explanation I’ve ever seen made it clear to me that restrictions on expanded macros can survive past the call site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So maybe I’m just obtuse, and torturing others because I once suffered long ago. Let’s go look at the relevant text in the C23 standard, shall we? It’ll either be enlightening… or further torture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ℹ️️&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;After all parameters in the replacement list have been substituted and # and ## processing has taken place, all place-marker preprocessing tokens are removed. The resulting preprocessing token sequence is then rescanned, along with all subsequent preprocessing tokens of the source file, for more macro names to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If the name of the macro being replaced is found during this scan of the replacement list (not including the rest of the source file’s preprocessing tokens), it is not replaced. Furthermore, if any nested replacements encounter the name of the macro being replaced, it is not replaced. These non-replaced macro name preprocessing tokens are no longer available for further replacement even if they are later (re)examined in contexts in which that macro name preprocessing token would otherwise have been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sentence I bolded, I think we clearly understood; I did explain it above. The two sentences afterward, which I put in italics, is where the restriction that’s hurting us is specified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, I took that to mean, “Even at the top level where the macro was called, no matter how many times subsequent replacement text gets rescanned, the called macro is still ineligible for expansion.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong? Why does the blue paint leave and then come back? This makes no sense. Right? Right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;😭😭&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I warned you, there’d be ugly crying. Better me than you though; I clearly deserve it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Close n-counter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it would be obvious to most readers that I had misinterpreted the standard. Perhaps, but even once I finally realized that my original interpretation couldn’t possibly be right, I still feel the above text from the standard is bit under-specified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, what are the boundaries for “nested replacement”? Clearly it’s not the case that once a macro is called, a parent of the calling macro can never replace it again. So does it mean, “the resulting text can never, in any way be involved in an expansion which produces an expansion ever again?” requiring full taint tracking of the replacement through all future transformations as long as the text could possibly be rescanned, no matter what?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, does it only apply to any text with the name of the function we called, and the second that changes, it could change back?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or maybe there are some different semantics?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s roll up our sleeves, with another little experiment, to help us determine how we should interpret the above test. What we’d like to see, is, can &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt; produce a macro invocation with a different name, that we don’t try to expand until after leaving the context in which it and &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt; are painted, and then somehow replace that macro with &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can make that happen, then we’ll test to see if we can call the resulting function is callable. Let’s junk our previous experiment, and go back to where we were before:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_ONE(x, ...) + 1 _COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__)
#define _COUNT_TOP(...)    __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_ONE(__VA_ARGS__))
#define COUNT(...)        (_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) + 0)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we want to try to change the value of &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP&lt;/code&gt; to something else to escape detection. It’s got to be a valid macro, but one that we’re NOT going to end up expanding when rescanning &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_TOP()&lt;/code&gt;. If we call it &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT&lt;/code&gt;, we don’t want &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT(2,3)&lt;/code&gt; to evaluate until we pop all the way back up into &lt;code&gt;_COUNT()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds like a tall order, but there’s are a couple of facts we’ve already learned, that can help us:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We know that, if we have a function-like macro named &lt;code&gt;X()&lt;/code&gt;, the preprocessor does not consider a bare&lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;with no parenthesis next to it to be an invocation of&lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rescans start at the replacement site, they don’t back up tokens.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So perhaps we can separate the function name and the arguments for a while, and somehow bring them together in a way where we could rescan it inside &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having the function name separate from an argument list will both keep it from running, and will help us avoid a rescan the first time we get the left parenthesis to plop down in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just need a way to add a spacer of some sort that goes away at rescan, to keep apart the name &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE&lt;/code&gt; from its argument list. That is, we’d conceptually like to do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_ONE(x, ...) \
   + 1 __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_ONE &amp;lt;&amp;lt;SPACER&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (__VA_ARGS__))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we’re going to change the name of &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDRECT&lt;/code&gt;. If we just do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_INDIRECT _COUNT_ONE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we’re going to re-generate &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE&lt;/code&gt; on the rescan, which is painted blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it’s actually &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; where we currently have the dire need to postpone evaluating it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need to turn &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; into a function, and keep THAT identifier separated from the parentheses that trigger it, via our to-be-written spacer. So this is the definition we want instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_INDIRECT() _COUNT_ONE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll also need to add the empty parameter list to invoke it on the other side of our spacer. So here’s what we really need &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE&lt;/code&gt; to look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_ONE(x, ...) \
   + 1 __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_INDIRECT &amp;lt;&amp;lt;SPACER&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ()(__VA_ARGS__))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we cascade up with replacements, we want the spacer to disappear, leaving:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT()(2,3)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, in the contents where we replace the spacer, we will have advanced the input head past &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT&lt;/code&gt;. So if the spacer expands to nothing, the rescan will know that &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; isn’t a replaceable macro, and go on with its day. But it will leave &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT&lt;/code&gt; next to the &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; so it can be called above, to generate the correct name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You can count on me being empty inside&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to get something to expand to the empty string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, once we get back up to &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt;, we will evaluate &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT()&lt;/code&gt;, which will leave us with &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE(2,3)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we get that far, will tinker to find if there are any conditions where we can re-invoke &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt;. Because hey, we already know there are, we just might not know WHAT they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to create a spacer. We can define a macro named &lt;code&gt;EMPTY&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define EMPTY
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And use that as our spacer. If you’ve ever peeked into someone’s recursive macros and been dumbfounded with what you saw, there’s a good chance you saw a macro named &lt;code&gt;EMPTY&lt;/code&gt; and at the time were thinking, “what the heck could that possibly do?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you know. But when you did see it, it was probably defined as a function-like macro instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define EMPTY()
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using it to postpone evaluation is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT EMPTY() () (2, 3)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would we use a function-like macro for our spacer? Doing so makes it easy for us to control how long we want to wait before we’re able to evaluate what we’re separating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, let’s say we nest our recursive call several levels down. Every level, we use the same trick recursively, separating &lt;code&gt;EMPTY()&lt;/code&gt; apart… using another &lt;code&gt;EMPTY()&lt;/code&gt; invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, if we need to postpone a total of three layers, we could write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT EMPTY EMPTY EMPTY() () () () (2, 3)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, &lt;code&gt;EMPTY()&lt;/code&gt; is a confusing name that detracts from what’s happening. we can encapsulate this into a more readable macro… or macros, one for each level we might want to postpone evaluation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define POSTPONE1(macro_name, args) macro_name EMPTY() args
#define POSTPONE2(macro_name, args) macro_name EMPTY EMPTY()() args
#define POSTPONE3(macro_name, args) \
                               macro_name EMPTY EMPTY EMPTY()()() args
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll only need the first of these by the way; but now you know, if you never have a use case where you have deeper nesting (though if you do, maybe worry your macros are getting too complex to be readable?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;POSTPONE1&lt;/code&gt; macro encapsulates the unintuitive &lt;code&gt;EMPTY()&lt;/code&gt; madness for us, allowing us to instead write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_ONE(x, ...) \
                    + 1 __VA_OPT__(POSTPONE1(_COUNT_INDIRECT, ())(__VA_ARGS__))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;EMPTY()&lt;/code&gt; invocation is hidden inside &lt;code&gt;POSTPONE1()&lt;/code&gt; That makes the code we use here, it’s more explicit that we’re going to postpone expanding &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT&lt;/code&gt;. We’ve even added the args we want to call it with as a second parameter, to make it more clear what we’re doing, instead of having a bunch of consecutive argument lists detached from their identifier, which many engineers find alien and incomprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, the rest of what we have is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _COUNT_TOP(...)   __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_ONE(__VA_ARGS__))
#define COUNT(...)        (_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) + 0)
#define _COUNT_INDIRECT() _COUNT_ONE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s now see if it is getting the right text up to the top, even though we won’t yet try to get it to expand (and thus, we will get a compiler error). If we invoke as &lt;code&gt;COUNT(1, 2)&lt;/code&gt; again, CPP will generate the following expansion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(+1 _COUNT_INDIRECT ()(2) + 0)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That… looks exactly like what we were hoping to see. As we wanted, the pieces came together, and &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_INDIRECT()&lt;/code&gt; did NOT get evaluated during the rescan process. If we had made a mistake, and the rescan had happened, it would have been replaced with &lt;code&gt;_COUNT_ONE&lt;/code&gt;, which we already know we could not trigger for re-evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s now see what happens if we try to force the expansion of the above, to finally get an answer to our question as to the true scope of blue paint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s wrap the body of &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; with a call to a passthrough macro, which we’ll name &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define EVAL(...)  __VA_ARGS__
#define COUNT(...) EVAL((_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) + 0))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our rules above, &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt; will substitute, and then rescan. So this passthrough macro forces the rescan we want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test case for our macro should be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int
main()
{
    printf("%d\n", COUNT(1, 2));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might notice, this actually compiles. And if you run it, it gives the right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;🥹&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, are we done?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we may be farther than expected, we don’t have something that will fully work. What’s important is that we’ve shown that blue paint FULLY gets removed from a macro when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We have finished all rescans of that macro where it was called; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EITHER the macro does not appear in the replacement text, or we completely exit the recursive expansion.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we still have a problem. If you change your invocation to &lt;code&gt;COUNT(1, 2, 3)&lt;/code&gt; then your code will no longer compile. Instead, it will expand to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(+1 +1 _COUNT_INDIRECT ()(3) + 0))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s happening should be clear at this point: while we are iterating over arguments, we are stopping after the second iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, that’s easy to fix. We can do so by…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passing the output of &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt; to another call of &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt;, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define COUNT(...) EVAL(EVAL((_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) + 0)))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we address the obvious complaint, I’d like to point out that the extra &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t mess up the results if we change our test invocation to &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;COUNT(1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt; will expand, but it doesn’t break anything when there are no macros in the text passed to it that are eligible for expansion. Once the last possible expansion happens, it will just keep copying its arguments to the replacement text, per the algorithm above; the associated rescans have nothing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that, it’s common to say, “Nobody needs more than 10 arguments!” and do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _E(...) __VA_ARGS__
#define EVAL(...) _E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(__VA_ARGS__))))))))))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although, more commonly, you’d probably see people do more expansions, perhaps enough to accommodate 20 or 50 arguments. Even there, I’ve seen some Microsoft APIs that convince me, that’s too low a limit, so I’d suggest at least 100 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use a much smarter approach that can still fairly compactly get us as many expansions as we think we might ever need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d guess that, if we saw a function with 1024 arguments, it would be explicitly TRYING to break our macro. So let’s do the base 2 version of the Spinal Tap “one more”, and get to 1025 expansions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _E1(...)    __VA_ARGS__
#define _E8(...)    _E1(_E1(_E1(_E1(_E1(_E1(_E1(_E1(__VA_ARGS__))))))))
#define _E64(...)   _E8(_E8(_E8(_E8(_E8(_E8(_E8(_E8(__VA_ARGS__))))))))
#define _E256(...)  _E64(_E64(_E64(_E64(__VA_ARGS__))))
#define _E1024(...) _E256(_E256(_E256(_E256(__VA_ARGS__))))
#define EVAL(...)   _E1024(__VA_ARGS__)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last expansion really is gratuitous; we could name &lt;code&gt;_E1024()&lt;/code&gt; to&lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt; and stop on the power of two, but what fun is that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before writing this article, I generally stopped at 256 iterations, but I was curious as to whether the compiler’s CPP was smart enough to skip unnecessary evaluations, given it’s a common idiom. I ramped the number of iterations up to 65,636, and built a minimal program that would trigger 100 different calls to eval. On a Macbook Pro using &lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt;, that many expansions took .13 seconds; when setting EVAL to 256 expansions, compiling took .06 seconds. When using &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;, both times were a bit more than twice as expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So no, we definitely shouldn’t keep going until we get to 2^64; it’s unlikely to work. But, I’ve never noticed compile time impact due to 256 iterations, even in programs using recursive macros extensively, and can recommend it, but it also seems 2^16 expansions is totally acceptable for cases where you might need it (probably when you’re iterating over something other than call arguments).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOW we can declare victory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hang on, I’m going to go cry again, but this time tears of joy. 😭😭&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;You can count me out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt;approach works, you may find it feels kludgy. Why ask the preprocessor to do all that additional work? maybe it can recognize the idiom and short-circuit a bunch of work with an &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt;? Is there really no better way?
There is a technique that facilitates the kind of compile-time recursion we’re trying to do here, without unnecessary layers of expansion.
The basic idea is related to the concept of continuations; every macro passes a bag of state to the ‘next’ function-like macro that should get called, doing it in a way that allows us to BOTH dodge blue paint, AND terminate without oblivious expansions.
However:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The approach is MUCH more complicated than what we’ve done so far (and I hope anyone reading should agree what we’ve done today is already much too complicated).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having used the continuation approach, I find it too brittle (as implementable in CPP), and significantly harder to debug than more traditional recursion work-arounds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The extra evals in the approach we’re using tend to be cheap enough, that the massive amount of extra complexity buys you virtually nothing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I suspect the continuation technique cannot be done without relying on undefined behavior (specifically, how the compiler chooses to resolve cases where there are multiple possible ambiguous valid expansions). But, it’s still really cool, and if you’re interested (and really want to risk your head going 🤯), check out this brainf— interpreter written entirely in C macros.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should note, there are still other ways we could avoid such deep compile-time recursion, or even all recursion if we aren’t trying to get close to an arbitrary number of arguments. It’s all far uglier (and way more challenging to understand), and what we’re doing is performant, enough so that added ugliness isn’t merited, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though, one thing I do recommend you do differently from what we’ve done today, is that you should add a common prefix to all your names, to remove the risk of name collisions — many libraries already define things like &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EMPTY()&lt;/code&gt;for themselves, and you never know what might make its way into your system, and cause chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t be bothered? Okay, I’m a pushover (and feel strongly about the issue). So I’ve provided a complete version for you at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Count your blessings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This journey has taken us further down the macro rabbit hole than anyone should ever have to go, yet we didn’t have to sacrifice ALL of our remaining sanity (it helps that I was already tapped out). As much as C actively worked to thwart us from our goal, we got there; now we have a good tool for better compile-time checking of C code in a number of cases, such as when we want to support variable argument functions. And, with incredibly minor changes, we can re-use the code to operate on each argument, to support other things we might want to automate to make our code more robust. For instance, we could add automatic casts or calls to runtime type checkers, or so on. All you really need to do is, take the text we insert (generating the addition that the compiler can easily fold into a count), and replace it with an invocation of a macro that the caller passes in, passing that macro the current argument. Yes, the C standard committee has good reason to disallow recursion— removing the restriction would undoubtedly break existing code. Yet, the difficulty of the whole exercise hopefully demonstrates the need for some quality-of-life improvements in C2Y, all of which can be done without significant backward compatibility risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of all, I’d love to be able to do far more meaningful work at compile time much more sanely, minimizing my use of macros (as I know many others would too). For that, the language should extend &lt;code&gt;constexpr&lt;/code&gt; capabilities, giving us good, full-fledged &lt;code&gt;constexpr&lt;/code&gt; functions, with as few limitations as possible. That may be a tall order for C2Y, given the complexity of that change.
But even still, I’d want to improve the macro system too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add a builtin macro, &lt;code&gt;__VA_COUNT__&lt;/code&gt;. We need it to avoid null truncation problems for varargs, and shouldn’t have to keep reinventing the wheel (or doling out&lt;code&gt;__VA_ARGS__&lt;/code&gt;in our code like it’s Halloween candy).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add another builtin macro, &lt;code&gt;__VA_EMPTY__(...)&lt;/code&gt;, which would be the inverse of&lt;code&gt;__VA_OPT__(...)&lt;/code&gt;; its arguments would only get expanded only when the are NO variadic arguments. This would make it even easier to ensure people have good tools to easily terminate the kind of recursion we did today. Assuming&lt;code&gt;constexpr&lt;/code&gt;functions take longer to do well, A&lt;code&gt;__VA_EMPTY__&lt;/code&gt;macro can also bridge the gap of not having a good compile-time IF available for complex use cases; it would be much easier to cobble together a reasonably robust one one in macros than it is today by pairing it with&lt;code&gt;__VA_OPT__&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;__VA_EVAL__(...)&lt;/code&gt;which simply expands its contents, with two semantic changes to the process that other macro goes through:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;When an expansion fully finishes, the entire macro gets rescanned again, as many times as necessary, until the full expansion reaches a fix-point (meaning, no more expansions are possible). That would allow us to worry about artificial limits on &lt;code&gt;EVAL()&lt;/code&gt;macros; they’d just stop when they should stop.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Every top-level rescan should remove all blue paint generated during one expansion, before starting the next expansion (alternately, it could forego further painting macros in the first place).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When an expansion fully finishes, the entire macro gets rescanned again, as many times as necessary, until the full expansion reaches a fix-point (meaning, no more expansions are possible). That would allow us to worry about artificial limits on &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A more general purpose &lt;code&gt;__MAP__(body_macro, state, ...)&lt;/code&gt;would be useful (though, to be fair, much less of a problem to build robustly if the rest of the above were present).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;While waiting for &lt;code&gt;constexr&lt;/code&gt;functions, it would be valuable to have a preprocessor built-in&lt;code&gt;__SHA256__&lt;/code&gt;that… replaces the contents passed to it (after expansion) with the SHA256 hash of those contents. I’ve seen more than a few cases where this would be incredibly useful for saving both startup costs, and ongoing costs. No? Why can’t we have nice things??!! Interestingly, doing a compile-time only implementation of&lt;code&gt;SHA-256&lt;/code&gt;using only C macros may seem possible, but I’ve built it (for strings one block in length), and it completely overwhelms both GCC and Clang, even with significantly reduced rounds.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the committee were to adopt most of the above, it sure would make one of the ugliest legacies the language has needed to carry forward far more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We mere mortals would be able to get the gist of expansion rules more easily, if we could tell ourselves, “macro recursion is disallowed unless you use &lt;code&gt;__EVAL__()&lt;/code&gt;”. That removes a huge source of confusion, but still leaves us with the problem of getting termination conditions right, which are a bit tricky.
Adding &lt;code&gt;__VA_EMPTY__()&lt;/code&gt; makes it pretty easy for someone to get the exit condition right in the common case where our recursion is being used to iterate over the arguments passed to function-like macros. &lt;code&gt;__EVAL__()&lt;/code&gt; would then essentially be able to function as a “do what I mean” operator, for most of the things people bang their head against when trying to write useful, robust macros to hide C’s unnecessary complexity. With just these two things, you would be able to implement &lt;code&gt;__VA_COUNT__(…)&lt;/code&gt;fairly simply:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define __REST__(x, ...) __VA_ARGS__
#define __VA_COUNT__(...) \
    __VA_EMPTY__(0) \
    __VA_OPT__(1 + __EVAL__(__VA_COUNT__(__REST__(__VA_ARGS__))))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s still a little obtuse, but it’s far more sane than our final product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Does this count?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said there was no price for my full implementation, and there’s not. But, if you really feel obliged, then spend a minute indulging me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can count the times I’ve written the word “count” more than 100 times in a week on one finger. The entire time I’ve been working on this article, I keep thinking about what might be my favorite dad joke ever, but I spent far more time in “macro hell” than I like. So, before we talk about our final implementation, I’m going to indulge myself. It will only make sense to people who grew up with US kids programming, and does not in any way contribute to this topic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Person A: “Who’s your favorite vampire?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Person B: “Without a doubt, the one who lives on Sesame Street.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Person A: “The puppet? He doesn’t count!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Person B: “I assure you, he does.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;⚡️Ha! Ha! Ha! ⚡️&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;              oooOOOooo
           oOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
         oOO"           "OO
    ____oOO  ====   ====  OOo____ 
    \   OO'      ! !.---. 'OO   /
     \  OO   &amp;lt;0&amp;gt; ! !!&amp;lt;0&amp;gt;!  OO  /
      \ Oo       ! !'---'  oO /
       \o        \_/        o/
        .' _______________ '.
      ,'   :   V     V   :   '.
    ,'      -_         _-      '.
  ,'          "oOOOOOo"          '.
,'              OOOOO              '.
-----------     "OOO"     -----------
                 "O"             
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, if you sat through that (or were smart enough to skip it), you’ve earned the full code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, I added a &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_&lt;/code&gt; prefix to everything to avoid name collisions. Additionally, internal helpers have a leading underscore. The notion of &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; indicating an internal variable has a long heritage (it is particularly prominent in Python, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our new top-level count macro is named &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_VA_COUNT()&lt;/code&gt;; I added the &lt;code&gt;VA&lt;/code&gt; to indicate we’re counting variable arguments (but didn’t want to make it too verbose, either).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I actually made some other changes from what we did above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, I first built a macro, &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_MAP(macro, ...)&lt;/code&gt;. The implementation of this new macro is structured in pretty much the same way as our &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; macro above, at least in terms of the recursion. Our major change, besides the names is that, whereas for each argument, &lt;code&gt;COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; ignores the argument and replaces it with &lt;code&gt;+1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_MAP()&lt;/code&gt; takes the argument, and passes it to a macro supplied by the caller. That caller-supplied macro gets passed the value of the parameter currently being visited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That makes it trivial to create &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_VA_COUNT()&lt;/code&gt;; we just have to call our new macro, and pass in a body macro that simply does &lt;code&gt;+1&lt;/code&gt; (ignoring the parameter value).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new macro gives us more flexibility, hopefully lessening the need to write future recursive macros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// To keep this compact width-wise (given the prefix), we only do two 
// expansions per line, and stop at 256 expansions. Extend as desired.

#define H4X0R_EVAL1(...)    __VA_ARGS__
#define H4X0R_EVAL2(...)    H4X0R_EVAL1(H4X0R_EVAL1(__VA_ARGS__))

#define H4X0R_EVAL128(...)  H4X0R_EVAL64(H4X0R_EVAL64(__VA_ARGS__))
#define H4X0R_EVAL(...)     H4X0R_EVAL128(H4X0R_EVAL128(__VA_ARGS__))

#define H4X0R_EMPTY()
#define H4X0R_POSTPONE1(macro) macro H4X0R_EMPTY()

// MAP(); If you remove the macro parameter, and replace the call
// `macro(x)` with `+1`, you'll see this is structurally the same
// as COUNT() above.
#define H4X0R_MAP(macro, ...) \
    __VA_OPT__(H4X0R_EVAL(_H4X0R_MAP_ONE(macro, __VA_ARGS__)))
#define _H4X0R_MAP_ONE(macro, x, ...) macro(x) \
    __VA_OPT__(H4X0R_POSTPONE1(_H4X0R_MAP_INDIRECT)()(macro, __VA_ARGS__))
#define _H4X0R_MAP_INDIRECT() _H4X0R_MAP_ONE

// A re-implementation of count on top of H4X0R_MAP()... it's simple now!
#define _H4X0R_COUNT_BODY(x) +1
#define H4X0R_VA_COUNT(...)  \
                           (H4X0R_MAP(_H4X0R_COUNT_BODY, __VA_ARGS__) + 0)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_MAP()&lt;/code&gt; call gives us a more general purpose way to apply transformations to a list of individual arguments. This can help us automate static type checking per-argument, for instance, when we’re implementing variable-argument functions and want to statically ensure all items at the call site have the same time (as done in the variadic function arguments implementation I wrote about last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a use case like that, we need to add the commas back in from the original call site. But we won’t want to add the comma at the end of last argument, because the C compiler will complain. There are plenty of different ways to handle this problem, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the output is being passed to a C varargs function where the same arguments we’re iterating over will have a correct &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;parameter before the values, we can simply add a dummy value (probably 0 since that’ll pass through easily in most contexts). This one is trivial when appropriate, but I don’t love it, as it isn’t always appropriate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We can rework our map implementation to call a different callback for the last parameter, or to call a separate callback in between parameters. This is definitely more workable, but requires more recursive macro work, overcomplicating things. And then, the extra parameter can easily be forgotten by callers, which would lead to confusing errors (any time you make a mistake calling a macro, but the error isn’t detected until the compilation step, we should expect it to be confusing).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We can let the caller handle the first argument separately, and then for any subsequent arguments, add the comma at the beginning, separating it from the previous argument that we know must be present.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I personally think the third option is the best compromise. Let’s look at a simple little example. While I normally would want to add more static type checking, sometimes the need might arise to convert a bunch of items of different types into &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we only need to do it for integer types and pointers, it’s not too hard to use a union to statically convert one item at a time to &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will create a temporary union, with two fields, one being our largest standard unsigned int type (&lt;code&gt;unsigned long long&lt;/code&gt;, guaranteed to be at least 64 bits), and a &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;. We will use a cast to assign to the first field, allowing us to insert any integer or pointer type into the anonymous union:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shorter integers will happily promote to a larger size.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pointers will convert, since they are never more than 64 bits in size today.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first field being unsigned prevents unwanted sign extension, when we insert signed values that are kept in smaller values.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then will take the value out of the anonymous union, using the &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; . The compiler is smart enough to not generate a real temporary object for this conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE(arg)                  \
    ((union { unsigned long long u; void *v; }){ \
         .u = (unsigned long long)arg,           \
     }).v    
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, let’s build a macro to return the first parameter item in a variable list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define H4X0R_FIRST(...)     __VA_OPT__(_H4X0R_FIRST(__VA_ARGS__))
#define _H4X0R_FIRST(x, ...) x
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for two macros here, is that we want to be able to tolerate cases where no arguments are provided.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then can do the same thing to get all the rest of the arguments, after carving off the first argument:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define H4X0R_REST(...)     __VA_OPT__(_H4X0R_REST(__VA_ARGS__))
#define _H4X0R_REST(x, ...) __VA_ARGS__
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we process the first argument, we’ll be able to call &lt;code&gt;_H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt; directly. For the rest of the arguments, we’re going to want to pass a macro to process the argument, which can reuse &lt;code&gt;_H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE()&lt;/code&gt;, but does need to add a comma before the argument. So it’s as simple as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _H4X0R_CONVERT_LATER_ARG(arg) , _H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE(arg)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll want to pass that macro to our map implementation. Here’s the call to our map function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _H4X0R_CONVERT_LIST(...) H4X0R_MAP(_H4X0R_CONVERT_LATER_ARG, __VA_ARGS__)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stitch this all together, we just need to peal off the first argument from the rest, and concatenate the two resulting pieces. The only caveat is that we need to be careful to avoid adding a spurious comma or semicolons in between the two bits we need. When in doubt, use &lt;code&gt;cc -E&lt;/code&gt; to review what’s getting produced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define H4X0R_VA_VOID_STAR_CONVERT(...)          \
    _H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE(H4X0R_FIRST(__VA_ARGS__)) \
    _H4X0R_CONVERT_LIST(H4X0R_REST(__VA_ARGS__))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dumb test case to show this working:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int
main()
{
    printf("%d items: (%p, %p, %p)\n",
           H4X0R_VA_COUNT(1, 2, 3),
           H4X0R_VA_VOID_STAR_CONVERT(1, 2, 3));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you may expect, this prints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;3 items: (0x1, 0x2, 0x3)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our knowledge, and our final &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_MAP()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_COUNT()&lt;/code&gt; implementations, we can now do some significant transformations easily most people find mind boggling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find it astounding, the level of difficulty required to understand enough about C macros to be able to build a primitive as basic as counting arguments statically at a call site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s such a high level of complexity involved, that it’s even more amazing to me, that once we got the understanding we needed, we could implement both macros in a mere 18 lines of code, exactly half of that being the rote &lt;code&gt;H4X0R_EVAL()&lt;/code&gt;implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in my view, by choosing comprehensible names, despite all the hurdles we’ve had to overcome, the final result looks almost trivial. Yet, the code alone does not hint at the knowledge you need to write it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m confident that nearly anyone who lacks a solid understanding of those basics who tries to gain understanding by trying to rebuild this code, but using it has a guide (perhaps to a slightly different use case), will be inflicting gruesome self-torture on themselves. They might have preferred to code their algorithm in the Brainf— implementation mentioned above!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is this stuff so hard after decades of standardization? Is the committee secretly a cabal of Rust zealots, that built time travel and went back to 1989, to maximize their torture of C developers?? Maybe that was the inspiration for the movie 12 Monkeys 🤔 Sounds plausible. Or did they just beam that into my head?! Where did I leave my tin foil hat?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy hacking (but hopefully not on C macros)!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post started as an out-of-control sidebar in my post on variable argument functions in C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Robert Seacord; his early feedback gave me the clarity I needed to (hopefully) help other C programmers over what is probably one of the biggest hurdles in the language… people who become C developers eventually master pointers, but to many senior developers, macro recursion has remained a dark art, requiring a magic incantation borrowed from Stack Overflow, Claude or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ivan O’Day also was critical here, BUT is responsible for me taking several extra weeks to get the article out once it was in decent shape… because he helped me see that I really needed the step-by-step example of a macro expansion, which I then had to find time to do!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emacs has holistically become my daily computing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My efforts have been focused on building emacs into the workflow of essentially everything I do, as long as it doesn’t involve heavy video or media, I try my very best to accomplish it in emacs. The idea is to achieve deep integration with everything I do on a computer, to the degree my thoughts are immediately able to be acted upon in the buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use hyprland as my window manager, and while I have heard of other managers/DEs (I was using GNOME for the better part of 6 months), I keep coming back to hyprland just because it works and is easy to configure. Also, for some reason, I seem not to have laggin in emacs on wayland in hyprland, while I had to previously run emacs in X11 mode in GNOME, go figure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Motivation#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have seen what people are capable of doing when their tools get out of the way, and they are free to just create. This is how world class athletes, musicians, artists, writers, and of course programmers take what is in their mind and translate it into reality. The idea is that if I can learn this “editor of a lifetime” - then the things that I want to create, the programs I want to write, will be achieved in a near frictionless environment, allowing for velocity that is not possible elsewhere. It is the ultimate sharpening of the axe before chopping the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why not EXWM?#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have considered using EXWM as the window manager (quite literally offloading window management to emacs, and “living in emacs” - to more of a degree than I do already), the hesitation I have is that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emacs is single threaded, therefore if anything in the system hangs, the whole system hangs, and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is only X11 where most of the development and forward movement in the linux space has been in wayland. While I understand this is not a tremendous issue, wayland does seem to be where the puck is going.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what I am aiming to do is replicate functionality as best as I can from EXWM to a wayland environment - not wholly possible, but also not wholly impossible, either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Emacs Launcher program#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at my dotfiles, you can see I have a script written in Go that allows me to call each and every one of my emacs controls anywhere is my system. I was previously calling each of these emacs commands in bash and with a sleep command so as to make sure I was targeting the emacs instance. No longer. This Go script has sped up my workflow by 10x.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Current setup#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How I Launch Emacs#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod SHIFT, E, exec, bash -c "emacs"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I almost never press this keybind, as emacs is opened from the get-go in my hyprland sessions. For that rare time I need to re-open it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Opening vterm as my default terminal#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, E, exec, emacsclient -n -e '(my/new-frame-with-vterm)'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This permits me to quickly open a vterm window and enter commands etc. If I need anything that is more graphically intense, I fallback to kitty terminal, but this is less and less these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Opening vterm in my emacs session quickly for in projects is done like so:#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, RETURN, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(my-open-vterm-at-point)'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Universal Launcher#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, SPACE, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (universal-launcher-popup))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to replicate a launcher (similar to wofi/rofi) in which I could easily launch apps and switch to them in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, my take on this is to replace wofi with this functionality. I was using ssh providers in GNOME, but then brought the functionality into my universal launcher. It has effectively grown to encapsulate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Passwords&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSH&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bookmarking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commands and program launching&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emojis&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TODOS (though org-agenda/calendar also handles this)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File navigation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web and documentation search&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is a work in progress, I use it every day, hundreds of times a day, and love the flow &amp;amp; speed my launcher allows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Capture to org mode#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = CTRL SHIFT, c, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (org-capture))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I am not “in” emacs (I am always in emacs by extension) I can still capture direct to emacs with a quick keybind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I capture to my org directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;notes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bookmarks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;contacts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;inbox (todos)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;events/deadlines&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very useful when I am wanting to save a thought, idea, bookmark, quote, what have you, and then integrate it with my org-roam file structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Notes#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod CTRL, N, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (find-file "~/org/notes.org"))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can navigate to my notes file very quickly to write emails, keep notes on stuff, and then translate those into my org-roam directory, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Calendar/Org Agenda#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, C, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (=calendar))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, N, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (my/org-agenda-dashboard))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quick access to my agenda and calendar from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Password manager#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, P, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (pass))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Password-store inside emacs to create, update, grab passwords and insert them on page in browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;File Browsing#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, F, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (dirvish))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use dirvish/dired for nearly all my file browsing and manipulation. I have some binds that allow me to pull up thunar for graphical drag-drop operations, but other than that files are dealt with inside emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The killer feature is that you can edit files as you would edit text, nothing else comes close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bookmarks#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, B, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (find-file "~/org/bookmarks.org"))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bookmarking within emacs allows me to keep all sites top of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Email#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod, M, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (=mu4e))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The greatest email client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Feed reader#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod CTRL, Z, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (elfeed))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading any feed from around the web, I follow youtube, blogs, news, etc. here - never going out to the web to read anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Music playing#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod CONTROL, M, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (emms-playlist-mode-go))'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You thought I wouldn’t play music in emacs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Emacs everywhere for editing text anywhere#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;bind = $mainMod CONTROL, E, exec, emacsclient --eval '(thanos/type)'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you are in a text box on any site, you can just edit the text in emacs, press &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt; and have it pasted right there for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will I use EXWM?#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that because I spend so much time inside emacs, I don’t really get the benefits of everything being a buffer. I only use a browser for projects, not as a window I have always open, and I don’t really need emacs to control buffers or give me the keybinds universally. I will never say never though, perhaps one day it will be my window manager of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are you integrating emacs in your workflow? I would be super interested to see other setups that allow you to use emacs as your one, true, holistic computing environment. Shoot me an email and tell me how it’s done!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, God bless, and until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bogdan Georgiev, Javier Gómez-Serrano, Adam Zsolt Wagner, and I have uploaded to the arXiv our paper “Mathematical exploration and discovery at scale“. This is a longer report on the experiments we did in collaboration with Google Deepmind with their AlphaEvolve tool, which is in the process of being made available for broader use. Some of our experiments were already reported on in a previous white paper, but the current paper provides more details, as well as a link to a repository with various relevant data such as the prompts used and the evolution of the tool outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AlphaEvolve is a variant of more traditional optimization tools that are designed to extremize some given score function over a high-dimensional space of possible inputs. A traditional optimization algorithm might evolve one or more trial inputs over time by various methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, that are intended to locate increasingly good solutions while trying to avoid getting stuck at local extrema. By contrast, AlphaEvolve does not evolve the score function inputs directly, but uses an LLM to evolve computer code (often written in a standard language such as Python) which will in turn be run to generate the inputs that one tests the score function on. This reflects the belief that in many cases, the extremizing inputs will not simply be an arbitrary-looking string of numbers, but will often have some structure that can be efficiently described, or at least approximated, by a relatively short piece of code. The tool then works with a population of relatively successful such pieces of code, with the code from one generation of the population being modified and combined by the LLM based on their performance to produce the next generation. The stochastic nature of the LLM can actually work in one’s favor in such an evolutionary environment: many “hallucinations” will simply end up being pruned out of the pool of solutions being evolved due to poor performance, but a small number of such mutations can add enough diversity to the pool that one can break out of local extrema and discover new classes of viable solutions. The LLM can also accept user-supplied “hints” as part of the context of the prompt; in some cases, even just uploading PDFs of relevant literature has led to improved performance by the tool. Since the initial release of AlphaEvolve, similar tools have been developed by others, including OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve and DeepEvolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tested this tool on a large number (67) of different mathematics problems (both solved and unsolved) in analysis, combinatorics, and geometry that we gathered from the literature, and reported our outcomes (both positive and negative) in this paper. In many cases, AlphaEvolve achieves similar results to what an expert user of a traditional optimization software tool might accomplish, for instance in finding more efficient schemes for packing geometric shapes, or locating better candidate functions for some calculus of variations problem, than what was previously known in the literature. But one advantage this tool seems to offer over such custom tools is that of scale, particularly when when studying variants of a problem that we had already tested this tool on, as many of the prompts and verification tools used for one problem could be adapted to also attack similar problems; several examples of this will be discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another advantage of AlphaEvolve was robustness: it was relatively easy to set up AlphaEvolve to work on a broad array of problems, without extensive need to call on domain knowledge of the specific task in order to tune hyperparameters. In some cases, we found that making such hyperparameters part of the data that AlphaEvolve was prompted to output was better than trying to work out their value in advance, although a small amount of such initial theoretical analysis was helpful. For instance, in calculus of variation problems, one is often faced with the need to specify various discretization parameters in order to estimate a continuous integral, which cannot be computed exactly, by a discretized sum (such as a Riemann sum), which can be evaluated by computer to some desired precision. We found that simply asking AlphaEvolve to specify its own discretization parameters worked quite well (provided we designed the score function to be conservative with regards to the possible impact of the discretization error); see for instance this experiment in locating the best constant in functional inequalities such as the Hausdorff-Young inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third advantage of AlphaEvolve over traditional optimization methods was the interpretability of many of the solutions provided. For instance, in one of our experiments we sought to find an extremum to a functional inequality such as the Gagliardo–Nirenberg inequality (a variant of the Sobolev inequality). This is a relatively well-behaved optimization problem, and many standard methods can be deployed to obtain near-optimizers that are presented in some numerical format, such as a vector of values on some discretized mesh of the domain. However, when we applied AlphaEvolve to this problem, the tool was able to discover the exact solution (in this case, a Talenti function), and create code that sampled from that function on a discretized mesh to provide the required input for the scoring function we provided (which only accepted discretized inputs, due to the need to compute the score numerically). This code could be inspected by humans to gain more insight as to the nature of the optimizer. (Though in some cases, AlphaEvolve’s code would contain some brute force search, or a call to some existing optimization subroutine in one of the libraries it was given access to, instead of any more elegant description of its output.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For problems that were sufficiently well-known to be in the training data of the LLM, the LLM component of AlphaEvolve often came up almost immediately with optimal (or near-optimal) solutions. For instance, for variational problems where the gaussian was known to be the extremizer, AlphaEvolve would frequently guess a gaussian candidate during one of the early evolutions, and we would have to obfuscate the problem significantly to try to conceal the connection to the literature in order for AlphaEvolve to experiment with other candidates. AlphaEvolve would also propose similar guesses for other problems for which the extremizer was not known. For instance, we tested this tool on the sum-difference exponents of relevance to the arithmetic Kakeya conjecture, which can be formulated as a variational entropy inequality concerning certain two-dimensional discrete random variables. AlphaEvolve initially proposed some candidates for such variables based on discrete gaussians, which actually worked rather well even if they were not the exact extremizer, and already generated some slight improvements to previous lower bounds on such exponents in the literature. Inspired by this, I was later able to rigorously obtain some theoretical results on the asymptotic behavior on such exponents in the regime where the number of slopes was fixed, but the “rational complexity” of the slopes went to infinity; this will be reported on in a separate paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, AlphaEvolve was extremely good at locating “exploits” in the verification code we provided, for instance using degenerate solutions or overly forgiving scoring of approximate solutions to come up with proposed inputs that technically achieved a high score under our provided code, but were not in the spirit of the actual problem. For instance, when we asked it (link under construction) to find configurations to extremal geometry problems such as locating polygons with each vertex having four equidistant other vertices, we initially coded the verifier to accept distances that were equal only up to some high numerical precision, at which point AlphaEvolve promptly placed many of the points in virtually the same location so that the distances they determined were indistinguishable. Because of this, a non-trivial amount of human effort needs to go into designing a non-exploitable verifier, for instance by working with exact arithmetic (or interval arithmetic) instead of floating point arithmetic, and taking conservative worst-case bounds in the presence of uncertanties in measurement to determine the score. For instance, in testing AlphaEvolve against the “moving sofa” problem and its variants, we designed a conservative scoring function that only counted those portions of the sofa that we could definitively prove to stay inside the corridor at all times (not merely the discrete set of times provided by AlphaEvolve to describe the sofa trajectory) to prevent it from exploiting “clipping” type artefacts. Once we did so, it performed quite well, for instance rediscovering the optimal “Gerver sofa” for the original sofa problem, and also discovering new sofa designs for other problem variants, such as a 3D sofa problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For well-known open conjectures (e.g., Sidorenko’s conjecture, Sendov’s conjecture, Crouzeix’s conjecture, the ovals problem, etc.), AlphaEvolve generally was able to locate the previously known candidates for optimizers (that are conjectured to be optimal), but did not locate any stronger counterexamples: thus, we did not disprove any major open conjecture. Of course, one obvious possible explanation for this is that these conjectures are in fact true; outside of a few situations where there is a matching “dual” optimization problem, AlphaEvolve can only provide one-sided bounds on such problems and so cannot definitively determine if the conjectural optimizers are in fact the true optimizers. Another potential explanation is that AlphaEvolve essentially tried all the “obvious” constructions that previous researchers working on these problems had also privately experimented with, but did not report due to the negative findings. However, I think there is at least value in using these tools to systematically record negative results (roughly speaking, that a search for “obvious” counterexamples to a conjecture did not disprove the claim), which currently only exist as “folklore” results at best. This seems analogous to the role LLM Deep Research tools could play by systematically recording the results (both positive and negative) of automated literature searches, as a supplement to human literature review which usually reports positive results only. Furthermore, when we shifted attention to less well studied variants of famous conjectures, we were able to find some modest new observations. For instance, while AlphaEvolve only found the standard conjectural extremizer to Sendov’s conjecture, as well as for variants such as Borcea’s conjecture, Schmeisser’s conjecture, or Smale’s conjecture it did reveal some potential two-parameter extensions to a conjecture of de Bruin and Sharma that had not previously been stated in the literature. (For this problem, we were not directly optimizing some variational scalar quantity, but rather a two-dimensional range of possible values, which we could adapt the AlphaEvolve framework to treat). In the future, I can imagine such tools being a useful “sanity check” when proposing any new conjecture, in that it will become common practice to run one of these tools against such a conjecture to make sure there are no “obvious” counterexamples (while keeping in mind that this is still far from conclusive evidence in favor of such a conjecture).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AlphaEvolve did not perform equally well across different areas of mathematics. When testing the tool on analytic number theory problems, such as that of designing sieve weights for elementary approximations to the prime number theorem, it struggled to take advantage of the number theoretic structure in the problem, even when given suitable expert hints (although such hints have proven useful for other problems). This could potentially be a prompting issue on our end, or perhaps the landscape of number-theoretic optimization problems is less amenable to this sort of LLM-based evolutionary approach. On the other hand, AlphaEvolve does seem to do well when the constructions have some algebraic structure, such as with the finite field Kakeya and Nikodym set problems, which we will turn to shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many of our experiments we worked with fixed-dimensional problems, such as trying to optimally pack shapes in a larger shape for a fixed value of . However, we found in some cases that if we asked AlphaEvolve to give code that took parameters such as as input, and tested the output of that code for a suitably sampled set of values of of various sizes, then it could sometimes generalize the constructions it found for small values of this parameter to larger ones; for instance, in the infamous sixth problem of this year’s IMO, it could use this technique to discover the optimal arrangement of tiles, which none of the frontier models could do at the time (although AlphaEvolve has no capability to demonstrate that this arrangement was, in fact, optimal). Another productive use case of this technique was for finding finite field Kakeya and Nikodym sets of small size in low-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of various sizes. For Kakeya sets in , it located the known optimal construction based on quadratic residues in two dimensions, and very slightly beat (by an error term of size ) the best construction in three dimensions; this was an algebraic construction (still involving quadratic residues) discovered empirically that we could then prove to be correct by first using Gemini’s “Deep Think” tool to locate an informal proof, which we could then convert into a formalized Lean proof by using Google Deepmind’s “AlphaProof” tool. At one point we thought it had found a construction in four dimensions which achieved a more noticeable improvement (of order ) of what we thought was the best known construction, but we subsequently discovered that essentially the same construction had appeared already in a paper of Bukh and Chao, although it still led to a more precise calculation of the error term (to accuracy rather than , where the error term now involves the Lang-Weil inequality and is unlikely to have a closed form). Perhaps AlphaEvolve had somehow absorbed the Bukh-Chao construction within its training data to accomplish this. However, when we tested the tool on Nikodym sets (which are expected to have asymptotic density , although this remains unproven), it did find some genuinely new constructions of such sets in three dimensions, based on removing quadratic varieties from the entire space. After using “Deep Think” again to analyze these constructions, we found that they were inferior to a purely random construction (which in retrospect was an obvious thing to try); however, they did inspire a hybrid construction in which one removed random quadratic varieties and performed some additional cleanup, which ends up outperforming both the purely algebraic and purely random constructions. This result (with completely human-generated proofs) will appear in a subsequent paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re living through the weirdest moment in human history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time since, well, ever, the cost of creating content has dropped to essentially zero. Not “cheaper than before”, but like actually free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s so easy to generate a thousand blog posts or ten thousand “””personalized””” emails and it barely costs you anything (for now).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory this sounds great, infinite content. Giving words to those who struggled before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So many opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you’re trying to sell, trust is collapsing faster than content is proliferating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I don’t mean “trust” in some abstract sense, but the real – who’s real, who’s credible, and what should I be paying attention to?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re not moving forward. We’re definitely moving backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A tale of a B2B SaaS company&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know someone who runs a B2B SaaS company’s sales – he’s very smart. He spent many many years building his network and being a “relationship builder” type of seller – earning trust the old-fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we spoke last Sunday, he told me “I ignore all email outreach, and I barely even pick up the phone if I don’t know who it is”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I can’t tell if it’s a real person or someone who’s scraped my details. I used to be able to tell. Now I can’t. So I just… don’t engage. Not worth my time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To dumb it down for you if you’re doing this outbound – he’s not asking “do I need this product?” that you’re selling, but he’s asking “why should I trust you specifically to deliver it?” – and you’re not getting through with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Marketing funnel? Nah. Meet the trust funnel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If being in marketing has taught me something, is that the “rules” and “playbooks” optimize for the wrong question – we craft positioning that explains what we do and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many cases, your prospect already knows they need what you’re selling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t need another pitch deck explaining why AI coding assistants increase developer productivity or why they can send more e-mails with an AI SDR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’ve seen forty of those this month (can we talk about how many AI SDRs there are????)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, this hurts saying too, but they don’t need proof that outcome-based pricing aligns incentives better than seat licenses. They read one of my 40 articles on the topic already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What they actually want to know is “why the hell would I buy it from you instead of the other hundred companies spamming my inbox with identical claims?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because everything is AI slop now, answering that question became harder for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard already, here are the differences between a marketing funnel and a trust funnel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Aspect&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Marketing funnel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Trust funnel&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Main Focus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Lead generation and conversions&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Relationship building and customer loyalty&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;End Point&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Purchase or conversion&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ongoing customer advocacy and retention&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Content Strategy&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Promotional, sales-focused&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Helpful, customer-focused, value-driven&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Success Metrics&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Conversion rates, sales numbers&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Satisfaction, repeat business, advocacy&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Timeline&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Short to medium-term&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Long-term, compounding trust&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clear that you need to be on that trust side!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;With normal marketing funnels, lead generation sucks now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s simply too boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a Claude license is like, $10 a month – content creation costs are effectively zero. Now everyone can afford to look credible. Perfect grammar. Personalized outreach that references your LinkedIn posts (albeit badly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of it can be generated in minutes, with no human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which means all of it is now suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now send all e-mail AND LinkedIn messages to the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because I can actually tell they didn’t come from humans who care about me or my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re all “vaguely” personalized, and they’re all “curious” about how I do something. Why? Because “I’m curious about…” is in a playbook that supposedly gets good responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the trust collapse for me: it’s not that I don’t believe your product works. I don’t believe you’re a real human who will still care after you sign the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rates are down, I’ll just send more messages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God, no. Stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old World (…-2024):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost to produce credible, personalized outreach: $50/hour (human labor)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Volume of credible outreach a prospect receives: ~10/week&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prospect’s ability to evaluate authenticity: Pattern recognition works ~80% of time&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New World (2025-…):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost to produce credible, personalized outreach: effectively 0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Volume of credible outreach a prospect receives: ~200/week&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prospect’s ability to evaluate authenticity: Pattern recognition works ~20% of time&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The signal-to-noise ratio has hit a breaking point where the cost of verification exceeds the expected value of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So prospects don’t verify. They just assume everything is noise. This is why I (and my friend) ignore all outreach, and I’m far from alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cognitive cost of determining “is this real?” for 200 messages exceeds the expected benefit of the 2-3 that might actually be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Back to trust…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to understand – your prospects aren’t asking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Does your AI coding assistant work?” (They probably assume it does)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Will it actually improve {some metric}?” (They assume it will)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Is the pricing competitive?” (They can compare that in a spreadsheet)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re asking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Will you still be here in 12 months when I’ve integrated your tool into my workflow?”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Why are you actually better or different from the 5 others I know of?”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Are you burning VC cash on unsustainable unit economics?”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“When the music stops, will I be left holding a broken integration?”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Have you actually figured out how to make money, or are you just another vibe-revenue vibe-coded startup hoping to flip before the math catches up to your credit usage?”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here’s the problem: they can’t tell if you don’t tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Not to be cynical, but…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not writing this to be cynical, but because I want to make sure you play the right game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, you have to answer “why should I buy this product category?” but also “why should I buy it from you?” and your content and marketing has to match that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your opportunity is huge. Here is what we all must do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust is still a human job: At least for now – AI may help you along the way but at least in 2025 only humans can build genuine emotional connection and credibility. You need that lasting loyalty and advocacy. Don’t rely on the so-called “personalized outbound” alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, relevance and customization are critical: AI should help you segment prospects meticulously and flag when human follow-up is likely to deepen trust, not just automate at scale. Use the outbound engine to be real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, keep a human involved: Too much automation can undermine trust. I expect at least some human engagement, especially in complex or high-value sales contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Is this actually different now that we have AI?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re representing a brand. And your brand must continuously earn that trust, even if you blend of AI-powered relevance. We still want that unmistakable human leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Spring is here and the nettles are growing again so I decided it was time to make a meal out of them. Most people know that stinging nettles are pesky green plants that irritate the skin when you touch them. What you probably don’t know is that they’re a nutritious source of iron, calcium, potassium, and silica as well as vitamins A, B, C, and K1. Stinging nettles also have anti-inflammatory properties and can relieve arthritis and rheumatism. They can be turned into soups, curries, and risottos (some recipes here) and you can get them completely free from practically everywhere in Britain over the summer. You’ve likely even got some in your garden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you collect them you need to wear gloves because they sting. The advantage of this is it allows you to make sure you’re collecting the right thing. If you’re unsure, just touch one and see whether it hurts which is exactly what I did. It hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The even look a bit scary with their toothy-edged leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got them inside, boil them in water for a few minutes and this will stop them stinging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re having stinging nettle risotto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People think that when you become vegan you have to give up lots of food. It’s true that I stopped eating animals but the number of different species I eat has grown considerably. This is because meat-eaters tend to eat the same few species of animals over and over again – pigs, cows, chickens. Whereas there are some 20,000 species of edible plants in the world. Meat also tends to fill you up. Indeed I’ve been to dinner with people where all they have on their plate is a slab of meat and nothing else. Whereas as a vegan (with the exception of a shitty Spanish restaurant that served me a plate of artichokes and nothing else) I eat a huge variety of species. Meat-eaters can eat these too but they often don’t because meat is so filling.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;On AI Slop vs OSS Security&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Author's Note&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have spent the better part of a decade in the bug bounty industry, and my perspective on this industry is shaped by this experience. The first five years were spent as a bug hunter and vulnerability researcher, where I developed an intimate understanding of what it takes to find, verify, and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities. The last five years have been spent at HackerOne (Nov, 2020 - Present), starting as a vulnerability triager where I personally reviewed tens of thousands of submissions, and now as a Team Lead overseeing technical services with a focus on triage operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination of experience, having worked both sides of the vulnerability reporting ecosystem, from the researcher's perspective to the bug bounty platform's operations, gives me a particular vantage point on how the industry is fracturing under the weight of AI-generated noise. I've reviewed the borderline cases where it's genuinely unclear whether a report is a hallucination or a real finding. I've felt the frustration of maintainers whose inboxes are drowning. I've also seen the pressure that platforms face trying to maintain quality while scaling to handle the deluge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I want to be explicit: these are my personal views and observations, informed by my professional experience but not representative of my employer in any way. HackerOne, as an organization, has its own perspectives, strategies, and positions on these issues. My analysis here reflects my own thinking about the systemic problems I see and potential solutions, not company doctrine or strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Anatomy of the Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are fundamental issues with how AI has infiltrated vulnerability reporting, and they mirror the social dynamics that plague any feedback system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the typical AI-powered reporter, especially one just pasting GPT output into a submission form, neither knows enough about the actual codebase being examined nor understands the security implications well enough to provide insight that projects need. The AI doesn't read code; it pattern-matches. It sees functions that look similar to vulnerable patterns and invents scenarios where they might be exploited, regardless of whether those scenarios are even possible in the actual implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, some actors with misaligned incentives interpret high submission volume as achievement. By flooding bug bounty programs with AI-generated reports, they feel productive and entrepreneurial. Some genuinely believe the AI has found something real. Others know it's questionable but figure they'll let the maintainers sort it out. The incentive is to submit as many reports as possible and see what sticks, because even a 5% hit rate on a hundred submissions is better than the effort of manually verifying five findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result? Daniel Stenberg, who maintains curl, now sees about 20% of all security submissions as AI-generated slop, while the rate of genuine vulnerabilities has dropped to approximately 5%. Think about that ratio. For every real vulnerability, there are now four fake ones. And every fake one consumes hours of expert time to disprove.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Human Cost Nobody Talks About&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A security report lands in your inbox. It claims there's a buffer overflow in a specific function. The report is well-formatted, includes CVE-style nomenclature, and uses appropriate technical language. As a responsible maintainer, you can't just dismiss it. You alert your security team, volunteers, by the way, who have day jobs and families and maybe three hours a week for this work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three people read the report. One person tries to reproduce the issue using the steps provided. They can't, because the steps reference test cases that don't exist. Another person examines the source code. The function mentioned in the report doesn't exist in that form. A third person checks whether there's any similar functionality that might be vulnerable in the way described. There isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After an hour and a half of combined effort across three people, that's 4.5 person-hours—you've confirmed what you suspected: this report is garbage. Probably AI-generated garbage, based on the telltale signs of hallucinated function names and impossible attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You close the report. You don't get those hours back. And tomorrow, two more reports just like it will arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The curl project has seven people on its security team. They collaborate on every submission, with three to four members typically engaging with each report. In early July 2025, they were receiving approximately two security reports per week. The math is brutal. If you have three hours per week to contribute to an open source project you love, and a single false report consumes all of it, you've contributed nothing that week except proving someone's AI hallucinated a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The emotional toll compounds exponentially. Stenberg describes it as "mind-numbing stupidities" that the team must process. It's not just frustration, it's the specific demoralization that comes from having your expertise and goodwill systematically exploited by people who couldn't be bothered to verify their submissions before wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Broader Burnout Crisis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Intel's annual open source community survey, 45% of respondents identified maintainer burnout as their top challenge. The Tidelift State of the Open Source Maintainer Survey is even more stark: 58% of maintainers have either quit their projects entirely (22%) or seriously considered quitting (36%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are they quitting? The top reason, cited by 54% of maintainers, is that other things in their life and work took priority over open source contributions. Over half (51%) reported losing interest in the work. And 44% explicitly identified experiencing burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's the gut punch: the percentage of maintainers who said they weren't getting paid enough to make maintenance work worthwhile rose from 32% to 38% between survey periods. These are people maintaining infrastructure that powers billions of dollars of commercial activity, and they're getting nothing. Or maybe they get $500 a year from GitHub Sponsors while companies make millions off their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maintenance work itself is rarely rewarding. You're not building exciting new features. You're addressing technical debt, responding to user demands, managing security issues, and now—increasingly—sorting through AI-generated garbage to find the occasional legitimate report. It's like being a security guard who has to investigate every single alarm, knowing that 95% of them are false, but unable to ignore any because that one real threat could be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you're volunteering out of love in a market society, you're setting yourself up to be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the exploitation is getting worse. Toxic communities, hyper-responsibility for critical infrastructure, and now the weaponization of AI to automate the creation of work for maintainers—it all adds up to an unsustainable situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Kubernetes contributor put it simply: "If your maintainers are burned out, they can't be protecting the code base like they're going to need to be." This transforms maintainer wellbeing from a human resources concern into a security imperative. Burned-out maintainers miss things. They make mistakes. They eventually quit, leaving projects unmaintained or understaffed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What AI Slop Actually Looks Like&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical AI slop report will reference function names that don't exist in the codebase. The AI has seen similar function names in its training data and invents plausible sounding variations. It will describe memory operations that would indeed be problematic if they existed as described, but which bear no relationship to how the code actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One report to curl claimed an HTTP/3 vulnerability and included fake function calls and behaviors that appeared nowhere in the actual codebase. Stenberg has publicly shared a list of AI-generated security submissions received through HackerOne, and they all follow similar patterns, professional formatting, appropriate jargon, and completely fabricated technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sophistication varies. Some reports are obviously generated by someone who just pasted a repository URL into ChatGPT and asked it to find vulnerabilities. Others show more effort—the submitter may have fed actual code snippets to the AI and then submitted its analysis without verification. Both are equally useless to maintainers, but the latter takes longer to disprove because the code snippets are real even if the vulnerability analysis is hallucinated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's why language models fail so catastrophically at this task: they're designed to be helpful and provide positive responses. When you prompt an LLM to generate a vulnerability report, it will generate one regardless of whether a vulnerability exists. The model has no concept of truth—only of plausibility. It assembles technical terminology into patterns that resemble security reports it has seen during training, but it cannot verify whether the specific claims it's making are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the fundamental problem: AI can generate the form of security research without the substance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The CVE System is Also Collapsing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While AI slop floods individual project inboxes, the broader CVE infrastructure faces its own existential crisis. And these crises compound each other in dangerous ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2025, MITRE Corporation announced that its contract to maintain the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program would expire. The Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the long-term contract, creating a funding lapse that affects everything: national vulnerability databases, advisories, tool vendors, and incident response operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The National Vulnerability Database experienced catastrophic problems throughout 2024. CVE submissions jumped 32% while creating massive processing delays. By March 2025, NVD had analyzed fewer than 300 CVEs, leaving more than 30,000 vulnerabilities backlogged. Approximately 42% of CVEs lack essential metadata like severity scores and product information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now layer AI slop onto this already-stressed system. Invalid CVEs are being assigned at scale. A 2023 analysis by former insiders suggested that only around 20% of CVEs were valid, with the remainder being duplicates, invalid, or inflated. The issues include multiple CVEs being assigned for the same bug, CNAs siding with reporters over project developers even when there's no genuine dispute, and reporters receiving CVEs based on test cases rather than actual distinct vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is that the vulnerability tracking system everyone relies on is becoming less trustworthy exactly when we need it most. Security teams can't rely on CVE assignments to prioritize their work. Developers don't trust vulnerability scanners because false positive rates are through the roof. The signal-to-noise ratio has deteriorated so badly that the entire system risks becoming useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What Doesn't Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banning submitters doesn't work at scale. You can ban an account, but creating new accounts is trivial. HackerOne implements reputation scoring where points are gained or lost based on report validity, but this hasn't stemmed the tide because the cost of creating throwaway accounts is essentially zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asking people to "please verify before submitting" doesn't work. The incentive structure rewards volume, and people either genuinely believe their AI-generated reports are valid or don't care enough to verify. Polite requests assume good faith, but much of the slop comes from actors who have no stake in the community norms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to educate submitters about how AI works doesn't scale. For every person you educate, ten new ones appear with fresh GPT accounts. The problem isn't knowledge—it's incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simply closing inboxes or shutting down bug bounty programs "works" in the sense that it stops the slop, but it also stops legitimate security research. Several projects have done this, and now they're less secure because they've lost a channel for responsible disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the easy answers work because this isn't an easy problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What Might Actually Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclosure Requirements represent the first line of defense. Both curl and Django now require submitters to disclose whether AI was used in generating reports. Curl's approach is particularly direct: disclose AI usage upfront and ensure complete accuracy before submission. If AI usage is disclosed, expect extensive follow-up questions demanding proof that the bug is genuine before the team invests time in verification. This works psychologically. It forces submitters to acknowledge they're using AI, which makes them more conscious of their responsibility to verify. It also gives maintainers grounds to reject slop immediately if AI usage was undisclosed but becomes obvious during review. Django goes further with a section titled "Note for AI Tools" that directly addresses language models themselves, reiterating that the project expects no hallucinated content, no fictitious vulnerabilities, and a requirement to independently verify that reports describe reproducible security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proof-of-Concept Requirements raise the bar significantly. Requiring technical evidence such as screencasts showing reproducibility, integration or unit tests demonstrating the fault, or complete reproduction steps with logs and source code makes it much harder to submit slop. AI can generate a description of a vulnerability, but it cannot generate working exploit code for a vulnerability that doesn't exist. Requiring proof forces the submitter to actually verify their claim. If they can't reproduce it, they can't prove it, and you don't waste time investigating. Projects are choosing to make it harder to submit in order to filter out the garbage, betting that real researchers will clear the bar while slop submitters won't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reputation and Trust Systems offer a social mechanism for filtering. Only users with a history of validated submissions get unrestricted reporting privileges or monetary bounties. New reporters could be required to have established community members vouch for them, creating a web-of-trust model. This mirrors how the world worked before bug bounty platforms commodified security research. You built reputation over time through consistent, high-quality contributions. The downside is that it makes it harder for new researchers to enter the field, and it risks creating an insider club. But the upside is that it filters out low-effort actors who won't invest in building reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic Friction fundamentally alters the incentive structure. Charge a nominal refundable fee—say $50—for each submission from new or unproven users. If the report is valid, they get the fee back plus the bounty. If it's invalid, you keep the fee. This immediately makes mass AI submission uneconomical. If someone's submitting 50 AI-generated reports hoping one sticks, that's now $2,500 at risk. But for a legitimate researcher submitting one carefully verified finding, $50 is a trivial barrier that gets refunded anyway. Some projects are considering dropping monetary rewards entirely. The logic is that if there's no money involved, there's no incentive for speculative submissions. But this risks losing legitimate researchers who rely on bounties as income. It's a scorched earth approach that solves the slop problem by eliminating the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI-Assisted Triage represents fighting fire with fire. Use AI tools trained specifically to identify AI-generated slop and flag it for immediate rejection. HackerOne's Hai Triage system embodies this approach, using AI agents to cut through noise before human analysts validate findings. The risk is obvious: what if your AI filter rejects legitimate reports? What if it's biased against certain communication styles or methodologies? You've just automated discrimination. But the counterargument is that human maintainers are already overwhelmed, and imperfect filtering is better than drowning. The key is transparency and appeals. If an AI filter rejects a report, there should be a clear mechanism for the submitter to contest the decision and get human review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transparency and Public Accountability leverage community norms. Curl recently formalized that all submitted security reports will be made public once reviewed and deemed non-sensitive. This means that fabricated or misleading reports won't just be rejected, they'll be exposed to public scrutiny. This works as both deterrent and educational tool. If you know your slop report will be publicly documented with your name attached, you might think twice. And when other researchers see examples of what doesn't constitute a valid report, they learn what standards they need to meet. The downside is that public shaming can be toxic and might discourage good-faith submissions from inexperienced researchers. Projects implementing this approach need to be careful about tone and focus on the technical content rather than attacking submitters personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sustainability is Hard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every hour spent evaluating slop reports is an hour not spent on features, documentation, or actual security improvements. And maintainers are already working for free, maintaining infrastructure that generates billions in commercial value. When 38% of maintainers cite not getting paid enough as a reason for quitting, and 97% of open source maintainers are unpaid despite massive commercial exploitation of their work, the system is already broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI slop is just the latest exploitation vector. It's the most visible one right now, but it's not the root cause. The root cause is that we've built a global technology infrastructure on the volunteer labor of people who get nothing in return except burnout and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what does sustainability actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, it looks like money. Real money. Not GitHub Sponsors donations that average $500 a year. Not swag and conference tickets. Actual salaries commensurate with the value being created. Companies that build products on open source infrastructure need to fund the maintainers of that infrastructure. This could happen through direct employment, foundation grants, or the Open Source Pledge model where companies commit percentages of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, it looks like better tooling and automation that genuinely reduces workload rather than creating new forms of work. Automated dependency management, continuous security scanning integrated into development workflows, and sophisticated triage assistance that actually works. The goal is to make maintenance less time-consuming so burnout becomes less likely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, it looks like shared workload and team building. No single volunteer should be a single point of failure. Building teams with checks and balances where members keep each other from taking on too much creates sustainability. Finding additional contributors willing to share the burden rather than expecting heroic individual effort acknowledges that most people have limited time available for unpaid work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, it looks like culture change. Fostering empathy in interactions, starting communications with gratitude even when rejecting contributions, and publicly acknowledging the critical work maintainers perform reduces emotional toll. Demonstrating clear processes for handling security issues gives confidence rather than trying to hide problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, it looks like advocacy and policy at organizational and governmental levels. Recognition that maintainer burnout represents existential threat to technology infrastructure. Development of regulations requiring companies benefiting from open source to contribute resources. Establishment of security standards that account for the realities of volunteer-run projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without addressing these fundamentals, no amount of technical sophistication will prevent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Arms Race Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CVE slop crisis is just the beginning. We're entering an arms race between AI-assisted attackers or abusers and AI-assisted defenders, and nobody knows how it ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HackerOne's research indicates that 70% of security researchers now use AI tools in their workflow. AI-powered testing is becoming the industry standard. The emergence of fully autonomous hackbots—AI systems that submitted over 560 valid reports in the first half of 2025—signals both opportunity and threat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The divergence will be between researchers who use AI as a tool to enhance genuinely skilled work versus those who use it to automate low-effort spam. The former represents the promise of democratizing security research and scaling our ability to find vulnerabilities. The latter represents the threat of making the signal-to-noise problem completely unmanageable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge is developing mechanisms that encourage the first group while defending against the second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This probably means moving toward more exclusive models. Invite-only programs. Dramatically higher standards for participation. Reputation systems that take years to build. New models for coordinated vulnerability disclosure that assume AI-assisted research as the baseline and require proof beyond "here's what the AI told me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might mean the end of open bug bounty programs as we know them. Maybe that's necessary. Maybe the experiment of "anyone can submit anything" was only viable when the cost of submitting was high enough to ensure some minimum quality. Now that AI has reduced that cost to near-zero, the experiment might fail soon if things don't improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, net-net, here's where we are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to vulnerability reports, what matters is who submits them and whether they've actually verified their claims. Accepting reports from everyone indiscriminately is backfiring catastrophically because projects are latching onto submissions that sound plausible while ignoring the cumulative evidence that most are noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want to receive reports from someone who has actually verified their claims, understands the architecture of what they're reporting on, and isn't trying to game the bounty system or offload verification work onto maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such people exist, but they're becoming harder to find amidst the deluge of AI-generated content. That's why projects have to be selective about which reports they investigate and which submitters they trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: not all vulnerability reports are legitimate. Not all feedback is worthwhile. It matters who is doing the reporting and what their incentives are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CVE slop crisis shows the fragility of open source security. Volunteer maintainers, already operating at burnout levels, face an explosion of AI-generated false reports that consume their limited time and emotional energy. The systems designed to track and manage vulnerabilities struggle under dual burden of structural underfunding and slop inundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The path forward requires holistic solutions combining technical filtering with fundamental changes to how we support and compensate open source labor. AI can be part of the solution through better triage, but it cannot substitute for adequate resources, reasonable workloads, and human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the sustainability of open source security depends on recognizing that people who maintain critical infrastructure deserve more than exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They deserve compensation, support, reasonable expectations, and protection from abuse. Without addressing these fundamentals, no amount of technical sophistication will prevent the slow collapse of the collaborative model that has produced so much of the digital infrastructure modern life depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CVE slop crisis isn't merely about bad vulnerability reports. It's about whether we'll choose to sustain the human foundation of technological progress, or whether we'll let it burn out under the weight of automated exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's the choice we're facing. And right now, we're choosing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published 6 November 2025 • Inter IKEA newsroom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;IKEA launches new smart home range with 21 Matter-compatible products&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IKEA is launching 21 new smart home products focusing on lighting, sensors, and control — all built to work with Matter, the universal smart home standard. The launch marks a significant step in making smart home technology easier to use, more affordable, and better adapted to real-life needs in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this launch, IKEA is rebuilding its smart home system and product range from the ground up. The new launch reflects years of development and testing in real homes, and a growing understanding of how people want smart products to work in their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The launch includes both new products and updates to existing categories – now built to work with Matter. This means IKEA smart products can connect with a wider range of devices and platforms, making it easier for customers to build a smart home across different brands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Until now, smart home technology hasn’t been easy enough to use for most people — or affordable enough for many to consider. This launch brings us closer to helping everyone feel ready and confident to get started,” says David Granath, Range Manager at IKEA of Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The updated range focuses on three key segments*, that provide the building blocks of a smart home that’s flexible, intuitive, and easy to expand over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lighting – The new smart bulb range from IKEA. Comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, lumen levels and styles, including colour and white spectrum options, and dimmable features.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sensors – motion, air quality, humidity and water leakage sensors designed to support wellbeing and prevent damage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Control – Remotes that make it easy to control devices from a distance, and a smart plug that can turn any product into a smart product.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*Full product list further down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This launch is about making the smart home experience better and broader. We're upgrading our most-appreciated products while also adding new ones to solve even more everyday challenges. Our focus has been on keeping things simple from setup to daily use, so it’s easy for people to start, use and grow a smart home,” says Stjepan Begic, Product Developer at IKEA of Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All Matter-enabled products need a smart home hub to work — like IKEA’s DIRIGERA hub, or one from another brand. As a certified Matter controller, DIRIGERA can also manage and control smart products from other manufacturers and brands. As a Matter Bridge, it ensures that existing IKEA non-Matter smart products will also be compatible with platforms using the Matter standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This launch is the first step in a broader update of the IKEA Home smart range. Looking ahead, IKEA will continue expanding into new product categories. The strategy is to launch products that are easier to use and more affordable than existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is still the same as when we started exploring the smart home in 2012: to make it easy to use, easy to understand, and within reach for the many. We start with understanding life at home, where we continuously watch, listen and learn what makes a difference in everyday life. We believe technology should serve a purpose, not exist for its own sake. With more than 900 million store visits each year, I think we’re in a good place to help more people discover the benefits of a smarter home,” says David Granath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sales start and local pricing may vary between markets. Please contact your local IKEA market for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discover the new Matter-compatible IKEA Home smart range:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The KAJPLATS smart bulb range includes eleven variations, offering a mix of shapes, sizes, lumen levels, and styles — with options for both colour and white spectrum, as well as dimmable functionality. Compared to the previous TRÅDFRI range, each bulb has more functionality, including more colour options and broader light intensity spans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E27/E26 – standard globe shape, 60 mm diameter &lt;lb/&gt;Colour and white spectrum, 1 055 lm – colour-changing&lt;lb/&gt;White spectrum, 470 lm – dimmable&lt;lb/&gt;White spectrum, 1 055 lm – dimmable&lt;lb/&gt;White spectrum, 1 521 lm – dimmable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;P45 E14* – compact profile, 45 mm diameter&lt;lb/&gt;White spectrum, 470 lm – dimmable&lt;lb/&gt;White spectrum, 806 lm – dimmable&lt;lb/&gt;Colour and white spectrum, 806 lm – colour-changing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GU10 – directional spotlight &lt;lb/&gt;Colour and white spectrum, 470 lm - colour-changing&lt;lb/&gt;White spectrum, 575 lm – dimmable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear-glass decorative bulbs – white spectrum only (dimmable) &lt;lb/&gt;E14* – 470 lm clear glass&lt;lb/&gt;E27 standard globe (60 mm diameter) – 470 lm clear glass&lt;lb/&gt;E27 large globe (95 mm diameter) – 810 lm clear glass&lt;lb/&gt;*E14 also available as E12 and E17 depending on local standardisations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smart sensors: Five variations for motion, air quality, humidity and water leakage designed to support wellbeing and prevent damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MYGGSPRAY - Motion sensor for indoor and outdoor use that turns on lighting automatically in areas like entrances, staircases, garages, or anywhere you need hands-free light.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MYGGBETT – Door/Window sensor. Detects when a door or window is opened or closed, and if connected to a smart system you can get notifications on your phone. Also works for spaces like walk-in closets, where it can trigger a light to turn on or off.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TIMMERFLOTTE – Temperature and Humidity Sensor. Measures the indoor climate at home. Press the button to view temperature, followed by humidity — one after the other.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ALPSTUGA – Air quality sensor. Measures CO₂, particles (PM2.5), temperature, and humidity to show the air quality in your home. Built to work together with IKEA air purifiers for better indoor air. Can also display the time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;KLIPPBOK – Water leakage sensor. Detects leaks and alerts you with a sound – and can also send a notification to your phone when connected to a hub. Small enough to place under sinks, appliances, or other risk areas.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote controls and plugs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BILRESA remote control with dual button – A simple way to control smart products from afar. Use it to switch lights on or off, adjust brightness, change colour, or trigger a preset scene.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BILRESA remote control with scroll wheel – Lets you adjust smart products with a simple turn. Use it to switch lights on or off, dim, change colour, or control a group or preset scene.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BILRESA Remote Control Kits (2x) – Kits of three colourful versions of the remote controls, in green, red and beige. One kit with three scroll wheels, and the other is with remote control with dual buttons.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GRILLPLATS smart plug. This smart plug lets you control ordinary lamps or smaller appliances remotely — turning them into smart products. It also tracks energy use and can be paired with a remote or motion sensor. Separate sales start&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I analyzed the lineups at the world's most popular nightclubs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years back I did a bit of dance music related data visualization over at Lazily Evaluated. My favourite was an analysis of clubs and their lineups using Resident Advisor / RA data, I called it Clubster Analysis. I always wanted to dig into the technical aspects of gathering the data, analyzing it and building the charts and graphs to tell a story and give people insight. With this blog I now have the right venue for that kind of tech talk, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Data gathering #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To visualize data, first you have to get some! For this purpose I wrote a little scraper in Python. I used Beautiful Soup to parse the html and grab the bits and pieces I was interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My scraping of a few thousand pages didn’t cause considerable load on the RA servers. But in the age of overzealous AI scrapers it’s worth being polite, so I throttled according to their robots.txt. I also maintained a local cache of html files I had already downloaded, so that I wouldn’t have fetch the same data repeatedly (past lineups are unlikely to change after the fact) just because I discovered some bug or error in my parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order I scraped in was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get the 20 most popular regions in RA (and then I dropped “Streamland” which was a pandemic era pseudo-region)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch the most popular clubs and some related metadata for all of those regions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each club, get the lineups for every 2019 event of theirs (the last full year before the pandemic started).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Save the results to csv files&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clean up, verification and Analysis #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did some spot checks to verify that my parsing was working as I expected and added tests to make sure I handled edge cases and normalized artist names. There was a lot of variance in how dates were formatted, how artists were linked, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that I analyzed the data. I built one big table/dataframe in Pandas by joining all the info from the csv files. Then I calculated the similarities between each pair of clubs in the data set using the Jaccard index. Consider all the artists that have played at two given clubs, take the intersection (number of artists that have featured in lineups at both clubs) over the union (all the artists that have performed at one or the other). As an example if Club A had 100 artists booked and Club B had 100 artists, and they had 10 bookings in common, the Jaccard index would be 10/190 = ~5%. This gives you a good way to compare large and small clubs and balances large and small lineups (some of the clubs have multiple rooms with very long events, others have one dj playing in one room all night long once a week).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the Jaccard index we can build a graph, using NetworkX from all the clubs. The edges between two nodes are weighted by the similarity of those clubs. On top of the graph we run community detection to create clusters (hence the clubster name). This gives us a rough idea of which clubs are most similar, that is to say, have similar tastes in their bookings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the year 2019, there were 131 clubs in the data set with 8.502 events. There were 9.405 unique artists making up 30.482 individual bookings. This means that the average artist in the dataset was booked 3.24 times at those clubs in that year and the average event had 3.5 artists on the line up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a whole, out of 8.515 possible pairs of clubs, 3.716 pairs had some overlap in their bookings and out of those the average overlap was 1%. This was lower than I thought, the bookings at European clubs felt more homogenous to me, but I suppose they book a lot of artists. It would be interesting to get more data, recent and historic, and see how this has evolved through time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Visualization #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was my first time using D3 to draw charts. There was a bit of a learning curve, in earlier projects I had used higher level charting libraries which have simpler apis. But with D3 you get a lot of control over how your charts look and behave which I think I used to good effect in this instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main goal was to visualize the clusters and to allow people to interact with the clubs. I coloured the clubs according to their clusters and sized them based on the number of followers they had on RA. I played around with the gravity and placement of the cluster, trying to find a balance that worked on different screen sizes as well as being a fair portrayal of the different communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then did some scrollytelling to tell the story of the data, as I saw it, while the reader scrolls down the page. But I also added filters and interactivity for people to explore and see if they agree with my telling of the story or if they can find one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time I didn’t find any great React and D3 bridges, so it was a bit of a hassle getting the React components to play nice with the D3 graph, but in the end I was able to connect the two with &lt;code&gt;createRef&lt;/code&gt; to the D3 svg component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the clustering I looked into the “resident factor”, how many times an artist was booked at a club repeatedly compared to all the one offs. This was lower than expected, most of these clubs were booking a constantly rotating assembly of talent, residents don’t play as big a part as I would have thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transitioning between the different sections of these graphs was one of my favourite parts. Seeing the clusters morph into dots and candlestick charts (and back again) was oddly satisfying. Took a lot of tweaking, but I think it really tied together the scrollytelling experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think these transitions would have been possible with the higher level charting libraries I’d used previously. So the decision to go with D3 felt justified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a great pandemic project that combined web scraping, data analysis, and interactive visualization to explore the global dance music club scene. I learned me some D3 for the visualization, got better at doing cartesian graphing calculations in my head and learned about the underlying svg mechanics that power those graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results surprised me: despite my perceived homogeneity of European club bookings, only 1% average overlap between venues suggested more diverse landscape than I expected. The diminished role of residents compared to one-off bookings also challenged my assumptions about how these clubs operate. For the story telling maintaining the balance between a narrative and letting users explore and decide for themselves was a fun challenge. I think these sort of passion projects can give us deep insights into our world and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technical stack I worked with: Python, Pandas, NetworkX, D3, and React proved powerful despite some integration challenges. The complete project is available on GitHub and you can explore the live interactive visualization yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun building this and am proud of the result. If you’re working on cultural data analysis, need help with web scraping and visualization, or just want to discuss interesting datasets, feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every year, the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) publishes the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report is compiled based on input from key industry players. This includes submissions from copyright industry groups that frequently highlight piracy challenges that in their view act as barriers to trade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous years, for example, the MPA and others have called for more site-blocking efforts to counter the piracy threat. Interestingly, however, other American companies now inform the USTR that foreign site-blocking measures are becoming a significant trade barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cloudflare Sees Piracy Blockades as Trade Barriers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To share its concerns, Cloudflare decided to participate in the annual trade barriers consultation for the first time this year. The company describes itself as a “leading connectivity cloud company” running one of the world’s largest networks, providing security, performance, and reliability services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Cloudflare, several foreign countries disproportionately impact U.S. technology providers, with many concerns relating to site-blocking measures that aim to deter online piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Spain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare writes that Spanish courts allow rightsholders to request “overbroad court orders” that authorize IP address blocking. Since a single IP address can serve thousands of domains, disrupting pirates often means that many legitimate sites and services are blocked too, causing widespread collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This practice results in the widespread and repeated disruption of tens of thousands of unrelated, legitimate websites, as well as the disruption of digital services, with no judicial opportunity for remedy,” Cloudflare writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These actions, designed to protect a narrow set of commercial interests, have caused significant collateral harm to businesses and users who are not the intended targets, without recourse or the possibility for affected parties to challenge the underlying order.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Spanish Government is aware of the problems, which Cloudflare says are at odds with international standards, but has chosen not to intervene in the issue. Therefore, it continues to present a significant trade barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Italy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare reports similar concerns in Italy, where the “Piracy Shield” site-blocking law has a direct effect on American companies. This blocking regulation requires network providers, including CDNs, to comply with blocking notices within 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The failure to include adequate safeguards against collateral damage has led to the inappropriate blocking of shared services of large cloud providers, which are disproportionately American businesses,” Cloudflare notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For instance, the blocking of a Cloudflare IP address resulted in tens of thousands of non-targeted websites being blocked in February 2024. Furthermore, the blocking of the domain “drive.usercontent.google.com” in October denied Italian users access to Google Drive for over 12 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts to expand Piracy Shield to public DNS resolvers and VPN services only make the problem worse, Cloudflare says, noting that some U.S. companies have already decided to leave the European country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automated piracy blocks are not the only reported trade barrier in Italy. Cloudflare also notes that the country allows rightsholders to “abuse” the courts to disrupt U.S. businesses by granting ex parte blocking orders without giving the companies a chance to oppose them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This coercive, penalty-based approach to removal of content, without adequate judicial review or due process protections, is a significant barrier to doing business in Italy,” Cloudflare writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;France&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In France, Cloudflare highlights Article L.333-10 of the Sports Code as a key problem. This has resulted in several pirate site blocking orders that go beyond regular Internet providers, requiring DNS resolvers and VPN services to take action as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare notes that some services lack the technical capabilities to implement these orders and as a result, several U.S. companies have already left the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, France passed a new anti-piracy bill that opens the door to automated IP-address blocking, similar to Italy’s Piracy Shield. This is a major concern for Cloudflare, which fears that this will only lead to more collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It increases the risk of overblocking legitimate content or mistakenly targeting websites that operate lawfully, potentially disrupting cross-border digital services,” Cloudflare writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;South Korea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;South Korea has also created trade barriers due to its site-blocking measures, Cloudflare reports. A revision to the Network Act in 2023 now requires “CDNs to restrict access to illegal content”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, Cloudflare and other American companies are required to maintain detailed and regularly updated blocklists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The South Korea Communication Commission (KCC) sends U.S. CDN providers a ‘block list’ of over 1.5 million URLs (with 30,000 new additions monthly),” Cloudflare writes, noting that this places an “unprecedented compliance burden” on companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conflicting Demands at the U.S. Trade Office&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare urges the USTR to take these concerns into account for its upcoming National Trade Estimate Report. Ideally, it wants these trade barriers to be dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These calls run counter to requests from rightsholders, who urge the USTR to ensure that more foreign countries implement blocking measures. With potential site-blocking legislation being considered in U.S. Congress, that may impact local lobbying efforts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If and how the USTR will address these concerns will become clearer early next year, when the 2026 National Trade Estimate Report is expected to be published.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
