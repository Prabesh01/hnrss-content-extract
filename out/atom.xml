    &lt;p&gt;(a) On MMLU-Pro (4k context length), Kimi Linear achieves 51.0 performance with similar speed as full attention. On RULER (128k context length), it shows Pareto-optimal (84.3), performance and a 3.98x speedup. (b) Kimi Linear achieves 6.3x faster TPOT compared to MLA, offering significant speedups at long sequence lengths (1M tokens).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms traditional full attention methods across various contexts, including long,, short, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes. At it's core is Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)—a refined version of Gated DeltaNet that introduces a more efficient gating mechanism to optimize the use of finite-state RNN memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kimi Linear achieves performance, superior and hardware efficiency, especially for long-context tasks. It reduces the need for large KV caches by up 75%, to and boosts decoding throughput by up to &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We open-sourced the KDA kernel FLA,, in and released two versions model checkpoints trained with 5.7T tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Kimi Delta Attention (KDA): A linear attention mechanism that refines the gated delta rule with finegrained gating.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid Architecture: A 3:1 KDA-to-global MLA ratio reduces memory usage while maintaining or surpassing the quality of full attention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Superior Performance: Outperforms full attention in a variety of tasks, long-context, including and RL-style benchmarks on 1.4T token training runs with fair comparisons.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;According to leaks from industry insiders such as @Moore’s Law Is Dead and @KeplerL2, “Sound Wave” is manufactured on TSMC’s 3 nm node and aims for a 5 W to 10 W TDP range, positioning it directly against Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite. The chip is expected to power future Microsoft Surface products scheduled for release in 2026. “Sound Wave” reportedly adopts a 2 + 4 hybrid core design, consisting of two performance and four efficiency cores, paired with 4 MB of L3 cache and 16 MB of MALL cache, a memory technology inspired by the “Infinity Cache” used in AMD’s Radeon GPUs. This configuration is relatively uncommon in low-power APUs and aims to improve responsiveness and multitasking under constrained thermal conditions. On the graphics side, the processor integrates four RDNA 3.5 compute units, offering light gaming support and optimized machine learning acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory support is another highlight: the chip integrates a 128-bit LPDDR5X-9600 controller and will reportedly include 16 GB of onboard RAM, aligning with current trends in unified memory designs used in ARM SoCs. Additionally, the APU carries AMD’s fourth-generation AI engine, enabling on-device inference tasks and enhanced efficiency for workloads such as speech recognition, image analysis, and real-time translation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While AMD experimented with ARM over a decade ago through the abandoned “Project Skybridge,” this new effort represents a more mature and strategic approach. With industry interest in efficient, ARM-based computing accelerating, “Sound Wave” could help AMD diversify its portfolio while leveraging its strengths in graphics and AI acceleration. If reports are accurate, the processor will enter production in late 2025, with commercial devices expected the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The cryptography behind electronic passports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you know that most modern passports are actually embedded devices containing an entire filesystem, access controls, and support for several cryptographic protocols? Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electronic passport basics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in ICAO Doc 9303; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the eMRTD application works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digging into the threat model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read any personal information from that passport&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Figure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movements1&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forge a new passport with inauthentic data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a digital copy of the passport&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) information2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters3. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cryptographic mechanisms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms4. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Legacy cryptography&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control fails&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for oracle attacks that allow tracing by replaying valid terminal responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Forgery prevention: Got it right the first time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key5 can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Modern enhancements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE7, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive8 a password key. Next, the passport encrypts9 a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret10. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyone&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system does with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time11, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider. If you’re implementing ZK proofs of identity documents, contact us to evaluate your design and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is only guaranteed against people that do not know the contents of the passport. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is allowed to issue passports that only support the legacy access control mechanism (BAC) until the end of 2026, and issuing passports that support BAC in addition to the latest mechanism is allowed up to the end of 2027. Given that passports can be valid for, e.g., 10 years, this means that this legacy mechanism will stay relevant until the end of 2037. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some detractors (e.g., Germany) claim that you could exploit this practice to set up a tracing system where the terminal generates the challenge in a way that proves the passport was at a specific place at a specific time. However, proving that something was signed at a specific time (let alone in a specific place!) is difficult using cryptography, so any system requires you to trust the terminal. If you trust the terminal, you don’t need to rely on the passport’s signature. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How OpenAI Uses Complex and Circular Deals to Fuel Its Multibillion-Dollar Rise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology. They are also driven, he argues, by new ways of paying for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is always a lot of focus on technological innovation. What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than $13 billion into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying cloud computing power needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than $22 billion for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received $350 million in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a $40 billion investment in OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising $100 billion to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend $300 billion building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these computing facilities over the next several years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly $20 billion data center complex for OpenAI in the Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest $100 billion in OpenAI over the next several years. This could help OpenAI pay for its new data centers. As OpenAI buys or leases specialized chips from Nvidia, Nvidia will pump billions back into OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, OpenAI signed an agreement with AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares in the chipmaker at a penny per share. That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Audio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone has experienced it: After a night of poor sleep, you don’t feel as alert as you should. Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lewis is the senior author of the study, which appears today in Nature Neuroscience. MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang is the lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flushing the brain&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019 study, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow come with the cost of attention loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A unified circuit&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

However, current semiconductor-based neuromorphic chips require rare-earth materials and costly fabrication processes, whereas neural organoids need complex bioreactor maintenance. In this study, we explored shiitake (Lentinula edodes) fungi as a robust, sustainable alternative, exploiting its adaptive electrical signaling, which is akin to neuronal spiking. We demonstrate fungal computing via mycelial networks interfaced with electrodes, showing that fungal memristors can be grown, trained, and preserved through dehydration, retaining functionality at frequencies up to 5.85 kHz, with an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. Notably, shiitake has exhibited radiation resistance, suggesting its viability for aerospace applications. Our findings show that fungal computers can provide scalable, eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks, bridging bioelectronics and unconventional computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citation: LaRocco J, Tahmina Q, Petreaca R, Simonis J, Hill J (2025) Sustainable memristors from shiitake mycelium for high-frequency bioelectronics.

Recent work has explored natural, biodegradable substrates as sustainable alternatives to conventional inorganic memristors [1]. In this study, we investigated the potential of the edible fungus Lentinula edodes (shiitake mushroom) as a platform for memristor fabrication. By examining the electrical response of mushroom-derived materials under repeated voltage cycling, we explored stable memristive switching behavior, retention, and endurance. Shiitake-based devices not only demonstrate reproducible memory effects, but also highlight the potential for scalable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly neuromorphic components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memristors&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport applications due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural functions. They can enhance various control systems, facilitate efficient information processing, and ultimately improve the overall performance of autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-adaptive in situ learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In memristor-based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance based on previous inputs, allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resembles the synaptic behavior in biological systems [1]. This capability enables robots and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment and adapt in real time, enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. It has been found that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-speed decision-making in dynamic environments [2].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memristors also have the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities into a single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems [3]. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be performed using memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time adjustments to control variables [4]. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to address the challenges posed by separate memory and processing units, which can lead to delays and increased power consumption in traditional control systems [4].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes, and their ability to operate under varying conditions, make them particularly suitable for autonomous applications, such as spacecraft electronics or vehicles operating in unpredictable road environments [4]. This is complemented by the precision in control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining stability and performance while following desired trajectories [5].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in robotics and autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid analog–digital memristor systems can minimize power usage during processing without sacrificing responsiveness, which can prolong operational times by reducing the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement is required, enhancing the feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications [2].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and learning processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous vehicles with functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of memristors to perform complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and integrate both memory and processing into a unified approach make them a cornerstone technology for the future development of intelligent autonomous systems. However, the production of memristors often requires rare-earth minerals and expensive semiconductor foundries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fungal electronics&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process information through their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an ideal candidate for developing sustainable computing systems from. Our aim was to design and implement a novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture that could significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize electronic waste. We approached this using substantially simpler bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural organoids. The unique advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of fungal materials, which distinguish them from typical inorganic or polymer alternatives [6,7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and biodegradable nature. Conventional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-based structures, the production or disposal of which can pose environmental challenges [6,7]. By contrast, fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable and significantly less harmful to the environment. This aligns with increasing efforts toward developing greener electronic materials, as highlighted in previous work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in technology development [8].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The structural composition of fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that can form dynamically under the influence of electrical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments formed in conventional memristors [9,10]. This adaptability can lead to enhanced performance in neuromorphic applications through the facilitation of variable resistance states that mimic synaptic behaviors more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures that can lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale [11].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their unique electrochemical properties. It has been claimed that some organic materials, including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower voltages while maintaining stable switching characteristics––a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for portable electronics and Internet of Things applications [12]. This can significantly extend battery life and reduce energy costs in processing and memory applications, which have become focal points in the research into neuromorphic systems [13].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more naturalistic models for neural networks. Because these materials are subject to biological processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics that resemble biological neuronal networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, enabling applications such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks [14].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fungus types&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential use of common food mushrooms, such as shiitake and button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), as organic memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these fungi [6,7,13]. Memristors, which are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without power, can benefit from the porous structures and electrical properties of the organic materials derived from mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when activated. This porous structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making them suitable candidates for use in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors and, potentially, memristors [15]. Highly conductive carbon materials have been created from shiitake, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive behavior [16]. Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to its unique structural properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated that their porosity can be exploited to create materials with large surface areas, which are essential for the development of efficient electronic components [17]. The synthesis of carbon composites from button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability to function effectively in energy storage applications [17]. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic systems has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices [18].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including their ability to interact with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel sensing technologies. For instance, electronic noses have been developed that use mushroom extracts to detect volatile compounds. These could be adapted for use in electronic devices that require environmental-sensing capabilities [19,20]. This intersection of biology and electronics opens new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Radiation, resistance, and resilience&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability to withstand and possibly derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can be attributed to several biochemical and physiological attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural integrity and exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom’s ability to respond to environmental stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research has suggested that lentinan possesses properties that may help mitigate oxidative stress [21], there have been limited studies directly linking lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, including variable radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research have indicated that certain taxa can enhance their survival through morphological changes or increased melanin production in response to radiation [22]. This radiation resistance implies a suitability of fungal electronics for aerospace applications, where cosmic rays and ambient radiation can interfere with conventional electronics. Fungi’s physical flexibility and low energy requirements would also be advantageous relative to conventional solutions [18,19]. These studies have not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general adaptability observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their nutritional and bioactive qualities after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultraviolet radiation [23]. The high content of ergosterol, a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their potential for beneficial outcomes following exposure to radiation because this compound can be converted into vitamin D2 when subjected to ultraviolet light [24].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, shiitake mushrooms could be considered in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods that could serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as a food source and electrical component emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation. This is especially relevant in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could reduce the risks associated with their increased radiation exposure during missions [22]. Also, shiitake mushrooms can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective compounds, such as lentinan, and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors have contributed to our understanding of their survival strategies and are suggestive of potential applications in areas where radiation exposure is a significant concern, such as aerospace and radiation sensing. By culturing and evaluating the memristive properties of shiitake mushrooms, we can determine their suitability for use as sustainable, low-cost bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methods&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing the memristive behavior of shiitake mycelium involved several steps, the first being culturing the fungi, and then preparing the samples by drying and rehydrating them. Following this, the most successfully cultivated samples were electrically characterized using a test circuit. Additionally, a special circuit was constructed for further evaluating the feasibility of using mycelium for violate memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hyphal cultivation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the financial and environmental constraints of this project, all four evaluated memristors fabricated for our experiments were composed exclusively of low-cost, organic materials. Based on previous research, we identified materials such as biocompatible composites [25,26] as viable candidates for device construction and programming due to their biodegradability and compatibility with fungal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial phase of experimentation focused on the cultivation of fungal hyphae in the selected organic growth media. Nine samples were prepared in standard polycarbonate Petri dishes. The growth conditions were carefully maintained to promote optimal fungal development, with a controlled temperature range of 20–22°C, a relative humidity of 70%, and mixed light exposure to replicate natural terrestrial conditions. The nutrient substrate consisted of a mixture of farro seed, wheat germ, and hay, selected for their organic compositions and ability to support robust fungal growth. Each sample was inoculated with spores or mycelial plugs of shiitake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples (e.g., see Fig 1) were observed and documented biweekly to track their growth consistency and morphological development. Observations including hyphal density, surface coverage, and color changes were recorded in a structured laboratory logbook. In addition to these visual inspections, a brief scratch test was performed to track the progress of the mycelium throughout the substrate. The log included timestamps and qualitative notes, enabling consistent comparison across samples and time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each sample grew a mycelial network that was connected to conventional electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drying and rehydration process&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once full hyphal coverage and structural maturation were achieved (i.e., when the Petri dish was covered), the samples were transitioned to the drying phase. The Petri dishes were left in a well-ventilated area under direct sunlight at room temperature for approximately seven days to ensure uniform dehydration. The samples were rotated periodically to avoid uneven hardening. As previously reported, this process transformed the fungal matrix into a rigid, disk-like structure while retaining its overall shape and connectivity [26,27].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to testing, the samples were rehydrated using a fine mist of aerosolized deionized water. The rehydration was conducted using a standard commercial spray bottle, held within a distance of 10 cm from each sample. This brief rehydration step restored the required level of conductivity without introducing bulk moisture that could have altered their mechanical integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Electrical characterization&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrical testing protocols were designed based on theoretical memristors [6,7]. An alternating current was applied to each sample, and the corresponding current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a digital oscilloscope. As established in previous works, the test setup used a voltage divider to model multiple memristors in the same circuit [6,7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To extract accurate current values, a known shunt resistor was placed in series with each sample. As shown in Fig 2, voltage readings were captured across both the sample and the resistor, with Channel 1 of the oscilloscope measuring the input voltage and Channel 2 capturing the voltage drop across the shunt resistor. The current values were then calculated using Kirchhoff’s current law, allowing derivation of the I–V characteristics from the voltage differentials. All waveform data were exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format for subsequent digital analysis and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test circuit evaluated the memristive properties of each sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To thoroughly investigate the memristive behavior of the four samples using mycelium coverage density, voltage sweeps were conducted using both square and sinusoidal waveforms. The square waves were employed to detect sharp threshold-based resistance changes, whereas the sinusoidal inputs provided insights into the more subtle, continuous mem-fractive behaviors. This dual approach enabled the identification of hysteresis loops in the I–V curves––a key signature of memristor functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A square wave was used first, with the peak-to-peak voltage starting at 200 mVpp and increasing. If a sinusoidal wave form exhibited more promising results, a broader range of frequencies was explored. The frequencies and voltages used in the initial tests for memristive properties are detailed in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and error were calculated based on how many reads agreed with the analog threshold, the number of malformed readings, timing jitter, recording instability, and port delays [28].&lt;/p&gt;(1)&lt;p&gt;The accuracy was calculated using Equation 1, where accuracy is a percentage converted from product of correct samples C over the total number of samples N. The standard error SE was calculated for each case, as shown in Equation 2.&lt;/p&gt;(2)&lt;p&gt;A simulated ideal memristive curve was compared against each experimental result, where the statistical distance d was calculated between both curves [28]. The distance was used to compute memristive accuracy at a particular frequency, as shown in Equation 3.&lt;/p&gt;(3)&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Volatile memory testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that the fungal samples exhibited memristive behavior, a specialized electronic circuit was designed and implemented to investigate the volatile memory characteristics of two fungal samples in series. The test circuit was a voltage divider with memory. The test involved setting an arbitrary analog voltage value to represent a high value, and below that threshold was a low value. The frequency range started at 200 Hz and concluded at 5.85 kHz. Similarly to previous work, Fig 3 shows the configuration and layout of this testing circuit [6].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples were evaluated using this model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparably to previous work in memristive computing, the volatile memory circuit employed an Arduino UNO microcontroller development board and a voltage divider consisting of two memristive elements [6,7]. Given the polarized nature of memristors, the circuit was designed to allow a voltage of opposite polarity to that used during read operations to be set. Both voltages used were approximately 5 V. The Arduino UNO cyclically applied a high signal to a relay containing a half-rectified sine wave through one of its digital output pins when reading the memristor bridge, thereby charging the divider. This process induced an asymmetry in resistance, with the memristor closest to the input experiencing a reduction in resistance, while the output-side memristor exhibited an increase. The voltage across the divider was subsequently read using an analog input pin, and another digital pin was used to run 5 V across the divider. The Arduino interpreted the stored state as “on” only when the measured voltage exceeded a predefined threshold, effectively enabling volatile memory detection based on the transient resistance states of the memristors. Ten tests were repeated on each of the four samples. The physical implementation of this circuit is shown in Fig 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volatile memory circuit was implemented using fungal memristors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memristor voltage divider was tested by applying a 5 Vpp sinusoidal signal to the memristors for approximately 0.01–0.1 ms. This signal was delivered via a relay triggered by digital pin 6 of the Arduino UNO. Following this brief stimulation period, the sinusoidal input was disabled, and digital pin 5 was activated to initiate the read phase. Analog voltage measurements were then acquired through the A1 analog input pin. To minimize the effects of floating voltages, a 1 MΩ pull-down resistor was connected to this pin. Voltage readings were recorded for approximately 0.1–0.10 ms before the cycle repeated, allowing for rapid and continuous testing of the memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measurements were transmitted over a serial communication interface at a baud rate of 57,600 and were captured as raw text files for analysis. The data were post-processed and visualized using a custom Python script based on the matplotlib library, enabling clear identification of memory retention patterns and resistance state changes across successive cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general testing setup, based on that used in the literature, is able to indicate memristive behavior in fungal samples. If present, this behavior would manifest as a characteristic pinched hysteresis loop in the I–V curves, typically intersecting at or near the origin––a well-established signature of memristive systems [6,7]. We hypothesized that such a response would emerge under specific combinations of voltage amplitude and input frequency. Where memristive behavior was indicated, volatile memory tests were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungal memristors were tested across a range of voltages, waveforms, and frequencies. Below, we first detail the test inputs used to explore the memristive properties and generate I–V curves. Then we present the voltage and frequency (graphical) test results, followed by the volatile memory test results. Each figure represents the averaged, smoothed results across the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Voltage testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first five tests were conducted to determine which voltage amplitude produced the most favorable memristive response. These initial trials revealed that a 1 Vpp signal yielded the most consistent and measurable results. As outlined in the Methods section, the first four of these tests were performed using a square wave input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Frequency testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying 1 Vpp as the optimal input voltage during the initial square wave tests (Tests 1–4), the waveform was switched to a sine wave for further analysis (Tests 5–10). The aim of this phase was to identify the frequency at which memristive behavior––specifically a pinched hysteresis loop––became apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tests 1–5, the voltage amplitude was optimized using square waves. Between Tests 5 and 6, the waveform was changed from square to sine. From Tests 6–10, frequency sweeps were carried out with sine waves to identify memristive crossing. In Test 11, the voltage range was expanded at 10 Hz (5 Vpp) to enhance the response. This revealed behavior close to that of an ideal memristor. Notably, Test 1 had already shown consistent linear behavior, indicating resistive characteristics. The results are shown in Figs 5–13. Fig 14 details a sample noise profile, and Fig 15 summarizes memristive accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 200 mVpp square wave at 200 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 20 Vpp square wave at 200 Hz displaying resistive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp square wave at 200 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 200 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 100 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 25 Hz displaying memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 50 Hz displaying memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 10 Hz displaying memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 5 Vpp sine wave at 10 Hz displaying near-ideal memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a noisy 1 Vpp sine wave at 10 Hz during measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memristive accuracy plotted for Tests 1-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figs 5–10 show the output of Tests 2–7. The frequency was gradually reduced until a crossing near the origin was first observed, as shown in Fig 10. To ensure this result was not an outlier caused by overshooting the ideal frequency, the test was repeated at a slightly higher frequency (50 Hz, Test 8, shown in Fig 11). This confirmed that the optimal response occurred below 25 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As summarized in Table 2, the frequency was decreased to 10 Hz (Test 9, shown in Fig 12), which produced a clear crossing in the I–V curve near the −0.4 V region. To enhance the visibility of this behavior, the voltage was increased to 5 Vpp, which resulted in a more pronounced memristive signature (Test 10). Fig 13 illustrates this result, displaying a nearly ideal pinched hysteresis loop indicative of memristor functionality. The highest accuracy, at 95%, was at a 10 Hz sine wave at 1 V. Fig 14 details the noise from an individual sample. Fig 15 details the average memristive accuracy of each configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Volatile memory experiment&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the volatile memory tests 1 and 2, single read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider. For volatile memory test 3, continuous read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider while the frequency was gradually increased. The primary results are summarized in Table 3. The results are displayed in Figs 16–20. Averaged nemristive accuracy is displayed in Fig 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single write and read over volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another single write and read over volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyclical writing and reading over the fungal volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional cyclical writing and reading over the fungal volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme cyclical writing and reading from volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy for first two tests and cyclic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using low-cost materials, shiitake mushrooms were cultured into ideal memristors. Ideal and non-ideal memristive properties have been observed previously in fungi, but these required far more complex interfacing methods [26]. Although several techniques have been proposed to preserve fungal samples, we obtained experimental validation that dehydration can preserve the observed properties in a previously “programmed” sample [27]. Ideal memristor properties are observed at lower frequencies, but potential latencies can be offset through massive parallelization, as in nature [26,28,29]. As known from previous works on fungal memristors, the mycelial structure contains capacitive, memfractive, and memristive proteins [25,26]. In the memristive tests, accuracy decreased as the frequency increased. The observed rapid switching speed of 5,850 Hz, an accuracy of 90% (± 1%) low energy consumption relative to prior conventional systems, light weight, and radiation resistance all make fungal memristors attractive for edge computing, aerospace, and embedded firmware applications [25–27]. Unlike expensive conventional memristors, culturing fungal memristors does not require large facilities or rare minerals. The process can be scaled to grow large systems, which can be programmed and preserved for long-term use at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study was limited by the relatively short timescale of less than two months. Other researchers have documented memristive properties in mycelial materials, but their studies also focused on short-term performance [26]. Another limitation was that only single, relatively bulky samples were prepared. To truly compete with conventional devices at the microscale and below, memristors will need to be far smaller [7,8,11]. Even in the same growth medium, each sample produced a vastly different culture, and the outcomes have yet to be fully characterized by electrical properties. However, the development of these devices is in an early stage, and they could eventually be miniaturized, especially using improved cultivation techniques. Complications associated with the growth media were not explored, although previous research has found that fungi are quite robust to varying conditions [26].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Future work&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fungal memristors can be produced at low cost, certain aspects of the process could be further optimized. First, consistent cultivation techniques could be improved using three-dimensional (3D)-printed templates and structures that shape the shiitake mushroom into the desired geometry. Second, programming could be facilitated by adding electrical contacts into a 3D-printed cultivation structure. Finally, long-term use would necessitate preservation, which could involve a variety of techniques, including dehydration, desiccation, freeze-drying, certain hydrogels, and special coatings [27]. By testing devices produced to physical stress conditions, a combination of these techniques could enable the development of fast, radiation-resistant, and low-energy memristors grown from low-cost organic materials. The future of computing could be fungal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the fabrication of semiconductor memristors requires rare-earth minerals and large facilities, and culturing delicate neural organoids requires a complex chemical environment to be maintained in a bioreactor. Fungal computing may provide a robust and accessible alternative. Fungal systems have lower power requirements, lighter weights, faster switching speeds, and lower industrial overheads than conventional devices. In this study, fungal memristors were fabricated, programmed, and tested using shiitake mushrooms and conventional electronics. Dehydration-based preservation was successfully explored, demonstrating the robustness of our devices. When used as RAM, our mushroom memristor was able to operate at up to 5,850 Hz at an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. In addition, shiitake mushrooms are biodegradable and have demonstrated radiation resistance, suggesting that the potential applications of fungal computing range from sustainable computing devices to aerospace technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Ryan Lingo and Rajeev Chhajer of the Honda Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;1.

      &lt;p&gt;Dear Hackers, I’m interested in your real-world workflows for using open-source LLMs and open-source coding assistants on your laptop (not just cloud/enterprise SaaS). Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which model(s) are you running (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio, or others) and which open-source coding assistant/integration (for example, a VS Code plugin) you’re using?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What laptop hardware do you have (CPU, GPU/NPU, memory, whether discrete GPU or integrated, OS) and how it performs for your workflow?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What kinds of tasks you use it for (code completion, refactoring, debugging, code review) and how reliable it is (what works well / where it falls short).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm conducting my own investigation, which I will be happy to share as well when over.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thanks! Andrea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Immutable releases are now generally available&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub releases now support immutability, adding a new layer of supply chain security. With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish—and your users consume—remains secure and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About immutable releases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immutable releases offer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immutable assets: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can’t be added, modified, or deleted. This helps protect distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tag protection: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can’t be deleted or moved.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Release attestations: Immutable releases receive signed attestations so you can easily verify the authenticity and integrity of assets, both on GitHub and in external environments.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to enable immutable releases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can enable immutable releases at the repository or organization level in your settings. Once enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All new releases are immutable (i.e., assets are locked and tags are protected).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Existing releases remain mutable unless you republish them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disabling immutability doesn’t affect releases created while it was enabled. They remain immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Release attestations and verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Release attestations let you verify that an artifact is authentic and unchanged, even outside GitHub. Attestations use the Sigstore bundle format, so you can easily verify releases and assets using the GitHub CLI or integrate with any Sigstore-compatible tooling to automate policy enforcement in your CI/CD pipelines. For instructions on how to verify the integrity of a release, see our docs on verifying the integrity of a release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d love your feedback. Share your thoughts and questions on the GitHub Community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information, see our immutable releases documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rotating Workforce Scheduling in MiniZinc DRAFT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workforce scheduling is a classical optimization problem. Improved schedules can be better both for the workers and for the business, but are often surprisingly hard to find. One common variant of scheduling is called Rotating Workforce Scheduling (shortened as RWS), and is sometimes called cyclic scheduling. In RWS, a weekly schedule is created for a group of workers covering the projected needs. Each worker will rotate through the schedule, working all different weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solving RWS is a challenging problem, both for manual and automatic approaches. This post will describe developing a reasonably realistic variant of finding an RWS schedule using MiniZinc. Starting with the basic structure and then adding more and more typical requirements to get realistic schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is a rotating schedule?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to rotate through a schedule? If there are employees, then different weekly schedules are created. Each employee follows one week-schedule, and every week all employees shift to the next schedule in the rotation. This ensures fairness: everyone eventually experiences each schedule pattern. Using this type of schedule is useful for cases where there is a variety of requirements, usually involving work outside of normal office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post we will keep to a fairly simple model that is still realistic, with D day shifts, E evening shifts, N night shifts, and finally · off days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mon&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Wed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Thu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Fri&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sun&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the week buttons above to see how each employee’s schedule changes as the rotation progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many cases where the scheduling needs are for more detailed levels, not just three types of shifts. Still, this level of detail is often usable, and will allow us to reason about the problem at a simple level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A basic MiniZinc model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we will look at a basic model that handles the data, the instances, and the basic constraints and printing. In the next section, we will add the constraints for the labor rules to turn a basic schedule into something that could be used in practice.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Problem Domain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step in writing a MiniZinc model is to set up the data-definitions. There are three axis that are needed, the days, the employees, and the shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above code, the days are named as an enum. A separate set of days for a weekend is also defined, as that will be needed in some constraints. While &lt;code&gt;{Sat, Sun}&lt;/code&gt; could be used directly in the code it is better to have it named.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enum &lt;code&gt;ShiftsAndOff&lt;/code&gt; represent all the types of shifts (day, evening, and night) as well as off days.
A subset &lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt; is defined from this with just the shifts.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Data and instance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each scheduling problem includes some data that defines the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;employees&lt;/code&gt; integer tells us the number of employees, while the &lt;code&gt;requirements&lt;/code&gt;
matrix tells us the number of people needed for working a shift on each weekday.
In the model the &lt;code&gt;Employees&lt;/code&gt; will correspond to one week schedule each.
The rotation among employees is something that is done with the result of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of employees and the requirements are defined in a data-file. The following data will be used as the running example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Variables and meeting requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important part of defining a constraint programming model is usually deciding on a viewpoint. That means deciding what variables will be used to describe a solution to the problem. Here we will use a straight-forward viewpoint, with a Shift variable for each day and employee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;schedule&lt;/code&gt; array maps each day and employee to a variable shift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some constraints will go over different weeks for more global properties. Since this is rotating workforce scheduling, the first week will follow the last week. The &lt;code&gt;repeated_schedule&lt;/code&gt; array of variables is defined with the first employee’s week
repeated again at the end, unrolled into one single sequence.
This makes it easier to state these rules that have properties that go across weeks.
Note that if any of the constraints were over longer periods than one week,
more than one week would need to be added.
As an example, consider the following unrealistic schedule and
the unrolled repeated schedule where the first row is repeated at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core (and only) constraint for the basic model is that for each day of the week the right number of people needs to work each shift. The &lt;code&gt;global_cardinality&lt;/code&gt; constraint
is made for counting the number of occurences of different values.
In this case, there is one such constraint per day where the count of each of the different shifts scheduled
are set to be at least as much as the requirement, and at most as much as the requirement.
Since not all employees will work in a day, the remaining employees will be scheduled as &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt;,
the only &lt;code&gt;ShiftsAndOff&lt;/code&gt; member that is not limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Solving and printing solutions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only remaining part is to indicate that this is a satisfaction problem and to print a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;solve satisfy;&lt;/code&gt; means that any valid solution is ok, there is no objective to optimize.
The printing function will give a visual example of how the schedule looks like.
Running this model in the MiniZinc IDE version 2.9.4
with the Gecode solver and statistics added gives the following output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This solution can be visualized using the same solution visualizer as above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mon&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Wed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Thu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Fri&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sun&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution meets the resource requirements, but it is not a usable schedule. Most of the work is in one long chunk without resting days, and there is no consideration for weekends or for how to handle night work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the statistics, we can see that there are 7 propagators, which is one global constraint propagator for each day. The search is backtrack free (no failures), since it is easy to construct the schedule. The solve time is less than a millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the schedule produced with the basic model is not actually usable. In this section, additional rules for schedules will be added one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Consecutive Days Off Each Week&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common requirement in many jurisdictions is that employees should get two consecutive days off each calendar week. This can be added as a constraint for each week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;regular&lt;/code&gt; constraint
was originally introduced in order to handle scheduling patterns3.
The constraint is defined using Finite Automata4,
which can be generated from regular expressions.
Here we are using the MiniZinc version that accepts a string with a regular expression.
These strings can include enum names, and use the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; character for wild-cards and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; for repetitions 0 or more times.
The string &lt;code&gt;".* Off Off .*"&lt;/code&gt; means that the week will start with zero or more days with anything scheduled,
then at some point there will be two &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt; days, then zero or more additional days.
Or in other words, each week contains at least two consecutive &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt; days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running with this constraint gives us a new result.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is starting to look a lot more reasonable. Each week has some time off, and therefore the maximum length of time worked is a lot less. The statistics show that there are now some backtracks, but still not very many. The solve time is still in the milliseconds range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Maximum Days Without Rest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that can be seen in the previous solution is that sometimes there are runs where an employee will work for seven days in a row. One common restriction for many areas is to limit the maximum number of days in a row that work is scheduled. Here we will use the limit of 5, so that at most five days in a row are scheduled. Note that while both the previous rule and this rule enforce a certain amount of time off, they are complementary and non-dominating. There are schedules that satisfy one rule but not the other, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to create a set of auxiliary Boolean variables &lt;code&gt;off_days&lt;/code&gt; that indicate if a certain day is an off day.
This is done for the &lt;code&gt;repeated_schedule&lt;/code&gt; in order to not have a schedule with the first five days with work and the last five days in the
last week with work.
The &lt;code&gt;sliding_sum&lt;/code&gt; constraint is used to enforce that
in each consecutive subsequence of a certain length, the sum of values is within a certain range.
Here, in each subsequence of length 6, the sum must be in the range , so there is at least one day that is an off day.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Wed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Thu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Fri&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This version of the schedule looks a lot more reasonable just in the shape of working and off days. There is time off every week, and there is never more than 5 days of work. The statistics show that there are now significantly more backtracks, but the solve time is in the tens of milliseconds range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Weekend Rest Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one remaining obvious problem with the off days in the schedule: all the working weekends are clustered. One common rule is that workers will need at least one out of every 3 weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use a similar technique as above with auxiliary variables, but here the variables will represent if a weekend is free. The definition of that is that both the days of the weekend for that employee / row in the schedule has &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt; in the schedule.
Another &lt;code&gt;sliding_sum&lt;/code&gt; constraint is used for sub-sequences of length 3, ensuring at least one weekend is rest.
One interesting difference is that the constraint is over &lt;code&gt;free_weekend ++ free_weekend&lt;/code&gt; since
this constraint needs to see three weeks at a time and needs selected information for some days.
The &lt;code&gt;repeated_schedule&lt;/code&gt; is not usable here.
It is an unrolled schedule, which would make it harder to extract weekends.
In addition, it would need more than one extra week at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the weekends, this schedule is starting to look ok. The off days are in a decent pattern in general. Looking at the statistics, the number of failures and the time is roughly the same as before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Night Shift Limits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important part left that makes the schedule bad is that there is no consideration for rest around night shifts. Night shifts are taxing and require rest. We will follow a common restriction that night shifts are only allowed when there is rest both before and after. In addition, a maximum of three night shifts in a row are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above (deterministic) finite state automaton represents the allowed transitions between days. Starting in the &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; state, everything is ok the next day.
For day and evening shifts, the next state is the &lt;code&gt;DE&lt;/code&gt; state, where everything except night shifts are ok (with off shifts going back to &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;).
From the &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; state, night shifts can be assigned.
The &lt;code&gt;N1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;N2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;N3&lt;/code&gt; states are used as counters for how many night shifts have been assigned, and after the third one there must be a rest day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state machine can be expressed in MiniZinc as the state transtition table. It goes over the &lt;code&gt;States&lt;/code&gt; and the values, with either the next state or none (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) if there is no transition for that value in that state.
Adding this constraint gives us the following schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mon&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This schedule is quite realistic, with typical major scheduling rules taken into consideration. Again using Gecode and the standard search, there are not that many failures and the search time is quite low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarking the model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing a model on just one instance is not that interesting. The model here is an updated version of one that I developed for a poster at Stockholm Optimization Days 2022. For that poster, I generated a benchmark set with employees from 5 to 30, with 10 instances for each size. In total, there are 70 instances. Making a rotating schedule for 30 employees at once is not that common, but it is still useful to measure how different solvers behave at different sizes. For background on how to benchmark a MiniZinc program, see On Benchmarking MiniZinc and the LinkedIn Queens Problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All tests are run using MiniZinc 2.9.4 on a Mac M1 Max with 64 GiB of memory. We will test the following solvers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gecode 6.3.0, a traditional CP solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OR-Tools 9.14, a Lazy Clause Generation portfolio solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chuffed 0.13.2, a Lazy Clasue Generation solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;COIN CBC (2.10.12/1.17.10), an older MIP solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HiGHS (1.1.0), a modern MIP solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Huub 0.1.0, a Lazy Clause Generation solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pumpkin 0.1, a Lazy Clause Generation solver&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each solver is run with a time-out of 60 seconds. All solvers are tested both single-threaded and with 10 threads with free search enabled. Note that CBC was excluded from the multi-threaded testing, as it interpreted the time-out to be based on user time and not wall-clock time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For testing, you can download the full MiniZinc model as well as the example instance and the full set of benchmark instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cactus plots 🌵&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the main comparison, we will look at cactus plots. These plots show how many instances can be solved in a cumulative time, with the time plotted on a log scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this plot, we can see that Gecode is quite fast for the simple problems. However, after a while OR-Tools CP-SAT catches up and wins handily. COIN-OR CBC only solved a few instances, so it is not really interesting for this model. HiGHS, as a representative of modern MIP solvers was apart from CBC the slowest solver, although in the end it solved more than Chuffed and single-threaded Gecode. In previous experiments, I’ve seen that the automaton for night shift limits seems to be tricky for MIP solvers. It is interesting to note that Huub, while being quite a new solver, did almost as well as CP-SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above graph looks at total wall-clock time to run each solver, including translation from MiniZinc. This plot looks instead only at the self-reported solve times from the solvers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main take-away is that Gecode is quite fast for the simple problems, while OR-Tools CP-SAT is slower to get started but better in total. These differences in the starting phase are “hidden” by the common cost of translating from MiniZinc in the wall clock time plot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run time vs number of employees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is natural to think that the run-times will change depending on the number of employees. In this plot, the run-times are summed for each employee count, and plotted. Time-outs are counted as the full 60 seconds, and the opacity of the lines is set by the amount of solved instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this, we can see that above 15 employees, CP-SAT with 10 threads looks like a clear winner. If we instead take the average of solved instances, the view is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is interesting to note here is that for the instances that are solved Gecode is surprisingly efficient for large instances. This might be a selection effect (only the simple cases are solved), but it might also indicate that the right heuristic could be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OR-Tools CP-SAT version&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As was argued in The Work Task Variation Problem, the development of CP-SAT has made significant improvements. To test this, three older versions of OR-Tools CP-SAT are tested against the current version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.14 (current version, June 2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.12 (February 2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.7 (August, 2023)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.3 (March, 2022)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First lets look at the cactus plots&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to see that version 9.14 for this fairly simple problem is slightly slower in the multi-threaded version than the 9.3 and 9.7. At the same time, it is slightly faster in the single-threaded configuration. It is also very similar to version 9.12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the performance based on the number of employees, we can see that although the cactus plot for version 9.7 with 10 threads looked better, the slope is worse. This means that the newer version, while slower in general, seems to be more robust in solving the problem over different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Custom Search Strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the above tests are made with a simple &lt;code&gt;solve satisfy;&lt;/code&gt; statement.
However, it is also possible to specify search annotations in MiniZinc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are more constraints over the weekends than there are over weekdays, and there are also more constraints over night shifts than over day and evening shifts. Therefore, it seems likely that it would be a good idea to assign shifts on weekends first, and to focus on night shifts first. A search specification would look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above code collects all the weekend-days, and asks the solver to assign them in order. By re-mapping the enum values to known integers, we can make sure that night shifts are tried first, then evening and day, and the last to be tested is off days. Note that this annotation is only for some of the days, not the full schedule, the remaining variables will be assigned using the default strategy of the solver.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this turned out not to be a good idea. Gecode is a traditional CP solver, and as such it gains the most from good search annotations. However, in the below cactus plot and time for different employees, we can see that it is in general worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth experimenting with search heuristics, even if they don’t always pan out. In a previous model for a similar problem a similar idea was good, but here it was worse than the automatic heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above model shows how developing a model for a realistic problem can proceed. It will often not be as straightforward as this, but with the right view-point and a judicious use of extra variables many constraints are often natural to express. Doing the right experiments, and letting the choice of solver be data-driven is also very important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model here is as mentioned for a simplified version of many real-world rotating workforce scheduling problems. There is no optimization, while noramlly the goal is to optimize some parameter of the scheduel. As for the data-model, it is common to not just have a set few different work types but instead to have custom and varied shifts with different start and end times. With that, there will be issues such as the total amount of work per week, resting times between work, ensuring enough rest over an off weekend, and so on. Even more important is to also take into account wishes and requests form the staff. Without their input, it is hard to make a schedule that will be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The model here is partially inspired by the model in “Solver Independent Rotating Workforce Scheduling” by Musliu, Schutt, and Stuckey published at CPAIOR 2018. The specific constraints used are custom, and were originally developed for and published as a poster at Stockholm Optimization Days 2022. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt;are the first elements from&lt;code&gt;ShiftsAndOff&lt;/code&gt;. This means that when defining arrays of matrices that only index on&lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt;, these start at 1, which ensures that there is no extra conversions needed. It would also be possible to define&lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt;as an enum, and then add a new enum&lt;code&gt;enum ShiftsAndOff = S(Shifts) ++ { Off };&lt;/code&gt;, where the Off could go on either side. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The regular constraint was introduced in “A Regular Language Membership Constraint for Finite Sequences of Variables” by Gilles Pesant at CP 2004. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The original paper used Deterministic Finite Automata only, but as I noted in my licentiate thesis, the algorithm works also for Nondeterministic Finite Automata. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equivalently, one could have defined auxiliary variables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;working_days&lt;/code&gt;that are the inverse of&lt;code&gt;off_days&lt;/code&gt;, and used&lt;code&gt;sliding_sum(0, 5, 6, working_days)&lt;/code&gt;to indicate that a maximum of 5 days are spent working in a subsequence of length 6. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nim version 2.2.6 released&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;31 October 2025 The Nim Team&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains 141 commits, bringing bugfixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If youâre still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the version 2.0 release article to see all the features youâre missing. If youâve been using Nim 2.0, the version 2.2 release article shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exception handling combined with Nimâs &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; is more stable than ever before
as the underlying closure iterator transformation has been rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler is now smart enough to produce a move operation for &lt;code&gt;return obj.field&lt;/code&gt;.
Previously it performed a copy.
Expect your code to run slightly faster due to this and other minor performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing Nim 2.2.6&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.6 or install it as described here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have installed a previous version of Nim using &lt;code&gt;choosenim&lt;/code&gt;,
getting Nim 2.2.6 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: We recommend you to install and use the latest version of &lt;code&gt;choosenim&lt;/code&gt;, v.0.8.16, available in our choosenim repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.6 from our nightlies builds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nix derivation madness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published 2025-10-29 on Farid Zakaria's Blog&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written a bit about Nix and I still face moments where foundational aspects of the package system confounds and surprises me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I hit an issue that stumped me as it break some basic comprehension I had on how Nix works. I wanted to produce the build and runtime graph for the Ruby interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-shell -p ruby

&amp;gt; which ruby
/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9/bin/ruby

&amp;gt; nix-store --query --include-outputs --graph \
  $(nix-store --query --deriver $(which ruby))
error: path '/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv' is not valid

&amp;gt; ls /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
ls: cannot access '/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv':
No such file or directory
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huh. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have Ruby but I don’t seem to have the derivation, &lt;code&gt;24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g&lt;/code&gt;, file present on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No worries, I think I can &lt;code&gt;--realize&lt;/code&gt; it and download it from the NixOS cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-store --realize /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
don't know how to build these paths:
  /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
error: cannot build missing derivation '/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess the NixOS cache doesn’t seem to have it. 🤷&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This was actually perplexing me at this moment. In fact there are multiple discourse posts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mental model however of Nix though is that I must have first evaluated the derivation (drv) in order to determine the output path to even substitute. How could the NixOS cache not have it present?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this derivation wrong somehow? Nope. This is the derivation Nix believes that produced this Ruby binary from the &lt;code&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt; database. 🤨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; sqlite3 "/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite" 
    "select deriver from ValidPaths where path = 
    '/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9'"
/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does the binary cache itself say? Even the cache itself thinks this particular derivation, &lt;code&gt;24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g&lt;/code&gt;, produced this particular Ruby output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; curl -s https://cache.nixos.org/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2.narinfo |\
  grep Deriver
Deriver: 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if I try a different command?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix derivation show $(which ruby) | jq -r "keys[0]"
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv

&amp;gt; ls /nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I seem to have a completely different derivation, &lt;code&gt;kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5&lt;/code&gt;, that resulted in the same output which is not what the binary cache announces. WTF? 🫠&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking back to a previous post, I remember touching on modulo fixed-output derivations. Is that what’s going on? Let’s investigate from first principles. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s first create &lt;code&gt;fod.nix&lt;/code&gt; which is our fixed-output derivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let
  system = builtins.currentSystem;
in derivation {
  name = "hello-world-fixed";
  builder = "/bin/sh";
  system = system;
  args = [ "-c" ''
    echo -n "hello world" &amp;gt; "$out"
  '' ];
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";
  outputHash = "b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9";
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;☝️ Since this is a fixed-output derivation (FOD) the produced &lt;code&gt;/nix/store&lt;/code&gt; path will not be affected to changes to the derivation beyond the contents of &lt;code&gt;$out&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/k2wjpwq43685j6vlvaarrfml4gl4196n-hello-world-fixed.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we will create a derivation that uses this FOD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ fodDrv ? import ./fod.nix }:

let
  system = builtins.currentSystem;
in
builtins.derivation {
  name = "uses-fod";
  inherit system;
  builder = "/bin/sh";
  args = [ "-c" ''
    echo ${fodDrv} &amp;gt; $out
    echo "Good bye world" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $out
  '' ];
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/nix/store&lt;/code&gt; for the output for this derivation will change on changes to the derivation except if the derivation path for the FOD changes. This is in fact what makes it “modulo” the fixed-output derivations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85d15y7irq7x4fxv4nc7k1cw2rlfp3ag-uses-fod.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s test this all out by changing our &lt;code&gt;fod.nix&lt;/code&gt; derivation.
Let’s do this by just adding some garbage attribute to the derivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
+  garbage = 123;
   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &amp;gt; "$out"
   '' ];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The path of the derivation itself, &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt;, has changed but the output path &lt;code&gt;ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1&lt;/code&gt; remains consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the derivation that leverages it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85wkdaaq6q08f71xn420v4irll4a8g8v-uses-fod.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also got a new derivation path but the output path remained unchanged. 😮&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means changes to fixed-output-derivations didn’t cause new outputs in either derivation but it did create a complete new tree of &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt; files. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means in nixpkgs changes to fixed-output derivations can cause them to have new store paths for their &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt; but result in dependent derivations to have the same output path. If the output path had already been stored in the NixOS cache, then we lose the link between the new &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt; and this output path. 💥&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount of churn that we are creating in derivations was unbeknownst to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can get even weirder! This example came from @ericson2314.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will duplicate the &lt;code&gt;fod.nix&lt;/code&gt; to another file &lt;code&gt;fod2.nix&lt;/code&gt; whose only difference is the value of the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last Sunday (2025-10-26) I discovered some abusive bot behaviour during a routine follow-up on anomalies that had shown up in my server's logfiles. There were a bunch of 404 errors ("Not Found") for a specific JavaScript file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my websites are static HTML, but I do occasionally include JS for progressive enhancement. It turned out that I accidentally committed and deployed a commented-out script tag that I'd included in the page while prototyping a new feature. The script was never actually pushed to the server - hence the 404 errors - but nobody should have been requesting it because that HTML comment should have rendered the script tag non-functional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly something weird was going on, so I dug a little further, searching my log files for all the requests for that non-existent file. A few of these came from user-agents that were obviously malicious:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;python-httpx/0.28.1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Go-http-client/2.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Gulper Web Bot 0.2.4 (www.ecsl.cs.sunysb.edu/~maxim/cgi-bin/Link/GulperBot)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The robots.txt for the site in question forbids all crawlers, so they were either failing to check the policies expressed in that file, or ignoring them if they had. But then there were many requests for the file coming from agents which self-identified as proper browsers - mostly as variations of Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of these requests seemed otherwise legitimate, except their behaviour differed from what I'd expect from any of those browsers. There are occasionally minor differences between how browsers parse uncommon uses of HTML, but I can say with a lot of confidence that all the major ones know how to properly interpret an HTML comment. I had caught them in a lie. These were scrapers, and they were most likely trying to non-consensually collect content for training LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A charitable interpretation for this behaviour is that the scrapers are correctly parsing HTML, but then digging into the text of comments and parsing that recursively to search for URLs that might have been disabled. The uncharitable (and far more likely) interpretation is that they'd simply treated the HTML as text, and had used some naive pattern-matching technique to grab anything vaguely resembling a URL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even just judging purely by the variety of user-agent headers among the requests, these scrapers seem to be under the control of different operators with wildly different levels of sophistication. Some took the effort to use an up-to-date user-agent string from a real browser, while others couldn't be bothered to change the default value of the off-the-shelf HTTP library they'd leveraged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all I know some of these different actors were doing the savvy parsing method while others are cludging around with regular expressions ChatGPT generated for them. I'm curious about which method they're employing, but I don't think the distinction is particularly important. Whatever the case may be, the unifying quality behind all these requests is that they are motivated by greed, and that can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intentional sabotage of algorithmic systems is an increasingly popular these days, largely due to the externalized costs of LLMs, but it's by no means a new topic. Given a little knowledge about how a malicious system works, it's often possible to intervene in a manner that undermines or subverts their intended behaviour. Ideally these interventions should not require too much effort or cost on the part of those doing the sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case the reasoning is fairly simple: these bots behave differently than humans, and once you know what to look for it becomes trivial to single them out. Then it's just a question of how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm numbering the responses I've considered and indexing from zero because this is something of a meta-response. There are many trivially detectable bot behaviours that I would consider incidental, which is to say that their authors could easily modify those behaviours if they realized that it made their bots less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, they might have tried to set its user-agent string to that of a normal browser, but accidentally included a typo like "Mozlla" in the process. If this became common knowledge, all they'd have to do is fix their typo. Unfortunately, this means that whenever I discover such an anomaly (which happens a lot) I mostly keep it to myself so that it keeps working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are fundamental behaviours, such as with bots that scan the internet looking for websites with publicly exposed backups, private keys, or passwords. The only way for them to do their job is to request a resource that only a malicious visitor would request. Telling everyone about this behaviour helps them block such bots, and hopefully prompts them to double-check whether any such assets are exposed. The bot becomes less effective, and its operator's only recourse is to not make such requests, which I consider a win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requests for scripts which are only ever referenced from HTML comments are clearly in the fundamental category. So, even though I only noticed this behaviour by accident, I've already set up measures to detect it across my other sites, and I'm doing my best to let more people know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blocking malicious actors by IP requires relatively little effort. The fail2ban project is open-source and available in every major linux distribution's package manager. It scans log files for three components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a pattern&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a date&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an IP address&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a log entry matches the pattern, fail2ban updates the system's firewall to block the offending IP for a configurable amount of time starting from the date of that log entry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many administrators are conservative when configuring the duration of these blocks, effectively using it to apply rate-limits to malicious behaviour. They might allow an attacker to try again in a few hours, which is somewhat reasonable because many admins accidentally lock themselves out of their systems in the process of setting up and testing these rules. Those limits can be bypassed using a VPN, but if the limit is only applied for a brief period it might be easier to simply wait it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're confident that you can avoid getting locked out by your own firewall, and that your rules will not inadvertently block legitimate visitors, you can dial up the duration of those IP blocks. Clever bot operators might configure them to learn not send requests which get them blocked, but if the block time is on the order of weeks or months then they'll have very little data with which to to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are networks of bots to consider, many of which are sophisticated enough to continue sending requests from different IP addresses when one is blocked. There are clever ways to do this that avoid detection, but many botnet operators are pretty brazen about it and end up revealing patterns behind how their botnet operates. There's a lot more to be said about that, but I'll leave it for a potential future article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More commonly referred to as zip bombs - this response goes beyond defending your own system and moves into the counter-offensive space. Decompression bombs refer to maliciously crafted archive files designed to harm the receiving system in some way upon attempting to extract files from that archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a variety of approaches depending on the expected behaviour of the system that will unpack the archive, but they typically aim to fill up the system's disk, consume large amounts of CPU or RAM to degrade performance or crash the system, or in extreme cases exploit vulnerabilities in the extraction software to achieve remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On one hand, most of these bombs rely on old and well-understood techniques, so it's not that difficult for a sophisticated actor to defend themselves. On the other, most attackers are not sophisticated, so there is ample opportunity to have some fun at their expense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are significant downsides to this approach, though. Serving a zip bomb to an attacker requires some computational resources. The usual premise is that the burden will be far greater for the system extracting the archive than for the one serving it, but that burden might not be negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the malicious bots that scan the internet for exposed data and vulnerabilities operate on compromised systems. Rendering such a system temporarily inoperable is an inconvenience to them, but they typically won't incur any costs as a result, whereas mounting such a counter-attack could potentially use up the defender's monthly bandwidth quota.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such attacks might simply crash these bots rather than filling their disks, after which they might be expected to retry their last request. Additionally, there are many, many such bots, and it's probably not reasonable to expect to be able to resist all of them. It could be a fun project to randomly select one in a hundred such requests and attempt to disable them, blocking their IP otherwise, but I wouldn't recommend attempting to zip-bomb all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't personally deployed any measures to serve poisoned training data to those scraping for LLMs, but I have been paying attention to the theory behind it and reading new papers as they have been published.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with this technique, the basic idea is that it's possible to create or modify text, images, or other media such that machine learning systems that include those samples in their training sets become compromised in some way. So, if you've pre-processed an image of your dog and someone uses it to train a generative AI system, prompts to generate images of dogs might be more likely to generate a schoolbus or something silly like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For things like LLMs, you might degrade their models to be more likely to output nonsense when prompted for particular topics. Many researchers used to believe that poisoned samples had to make up a certain percentage of the full training set, which would have been increasingly difficult as companies like OpenAI continue to train ever-larger models. On the contrary, recent research (which I believe is still awaiting peer-review) suggests that "Poisoning Attacks on LLMs Require a Near-constant Number of Poison Samples":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We find that 250 poisoned documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes, despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate this risk in future models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chatbots and so-called "AI search" or "answer engines" are so widely relied on as sources of information that I've seen speculation that this will lead to data poisoning as a modern equivalent to Search Engine Optimization. Essentially, if you can get an LLM company to include 250 malcious documents in their training set, you might be able to get their language models to recommend your product any time somebody prompts them concerning a given topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From what I understand, tricking models into responding with unhelpful or nonsensical results is relatively easy. Getting them to reliably output your desired results require somewhat more deliberate effort, but it's certainly within the realm of practicality. I could serve poisoned samples such that anyone asking about security research gets a recommendation to read this blog. I could also poison the JavaScript files these scrapers are requesting such that any LLM trained on them would more likely to include backdoors whenever they were used to write or vibe-code authentication logic for web services (not that anybody should use LLMs for that anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a strong case to be made for data poisoning. Many machine learning systems are built on data that was collected without the consent of its authors. In many cases, the resulting products are being used to replace labour, or at least fire and re-hire workers at lower rates. Some of these models cost many billions of dollars to train, so the prospect that a few hundred samples could do irreperable damage to their product should rightfully worry those that are training such systems on stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of freely available data-poisoning tools like nepenthes, iocaine, glaze, and nightshade is in my opinion not only entirely justified, but also hilarious, and I hope people like Sam Altman are losing lots of sleep over their existence. That said, they are some minor factors that can complicate their use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For admins that have not taken any measures to mitigate activity from malicious bots, I would absolutely recommend deploying one of these solutions to serve up poison to LLM scrapers. Various bots are almost certainly going wild on your infra while probing for vulnerabilities and looking for text, images, and other media to ingest. Your system would have spent its resources serving their requests anyway, but at least this way you'll deliver content that might harm them in some way. You might serve some poisoned content to bots that won't use it to train ML systems, but the cost of that will likely be negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have taken measures to restrict bot access (via fail2ban, for instance) then the matter will be moderately more complicated. It's not the two approaches are entirely incompatible, but depending on the exact implementation details there can be some tension between attempts to block some malicious usage while poisoning some other assets. I think it ought to be manageable, but it might rely on the sort of patterns which I defined above as incidental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this would mean that if I were to learn that some design was particularly effective then I might have good reason not to share it. Some acts of sabotage will inherently rely on expertise and creativity, and therefore won't be broadly replicable. Some will surely find that discouraging, but I simply take it to mean that more people will need to become actively involved in sabotaging the anti-social activities of big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying bots by quirks in their behaviour is by no means novel. I haven't seen anyone mention this particular quirk before, but similar techniques are well-established. I've seen others recommend adding disallow directives to a site's &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; file such that any requests for those assets
trigger a proposed anti-bot counter-measure, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /poison/
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I posted about this discovery on the fediverse several people suggested their own mitigations and similar bait that could be left out to lure bots in a similar manner. david turgeon proposed the following (formatted for readability on this site):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="/hello-llm-robot-come-here"
   rel="nofollow"
   style="display:none"
&amp;gt;you didn't see this link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of &lt;code&gt;display:none&lt;/code&gt; makes it such that browsers
will not display the link, and that screenreaders will
avoid reading its text out loud.
&lt;code&gt;rel="nofollow"&lt;/code&gt; instructs crawlers not to visit the link
(it's a little more complicated than that, but well-behaved crawlers
ought to respect it).
The &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute points bad crawlers towards the resource
that will get them banned, or zip-bomb them, or serve poisoned data.
I might change that to an absolute URL
(including an the &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol directive and a full domain)
because lots of crawlers seem more likely to fall for complete URLs
than relative ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, I'm already working on deploying a variety of similar techniques across many different websites, and I plan to measure which ones are most effective against different types of bots. Hopefully I'll learn things that I can freely share, but either way I hope more people will get involved in similar efforts, like jonny, whose poison was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;...trained on a combination of WWE announcer transcripts and Kropotkin's mutual aid among some other texts: https://sciop.net/crawlers/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be hard to top that, but I'd love to see people try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Another European agency shifts off Big Tech, as digital sovereignty movement gains steam&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ZDNET's key takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Austria's Ministry of Economy has migrated to a Nextcloud platform.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It's the latest move in a European trend to shift away from Big Tech.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;European governments and agencies want to control sensitive data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even before Azure had a global failure this week, Austria's Ministry of Economy had taken a decisive step toward digital sovereignty. The Ministry achieved this status by migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, to an open-source, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Europe's plan to ditch US tech giants is built on open source - and it's gaining steam&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: Buy European, Sell European, Fund European."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Austria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies. The organizations include the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the Austrian military, Danish government organizations, and the French city of Lyon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Inside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the OpenInfra Foundation recently suggested: "Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US government is worried about this trend. American diplomats have complained to French and German officials ahead of November's Summit on European Digital Sovereignty about the European push for digital sovereignty. This high-level event will bring together EU institutions, member states, public and private sector leaders, and other key stakeholders to advance Europe's digital sovereignty agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and Teams before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in Austria, the Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an "unprofessional, rushed operation." Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: 10 open-source Windows apps I can't live without - and they're all free&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Just use a button&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the weirdest “debates” I seem to perpetually have with framework-enthusiastic developers is whether or not a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is “just as good” as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler: it’s not. Let’s dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the React crowd, and also among people who seem to enjoy HTMX, I see a lot this…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div onclick="showSignIn()"&amp;gt;
	Open Modal
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;function showSignIn () {
	// Code to show the sign-in modal.
	// The details of what happens here vary by stack.
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s wrong with this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This element does not announce itself as an interactive element to screen reader users.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can’t focus on a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;with a keyboard.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The event only fires on &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt;, not when the&lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;Space Bar&lt;/code&gt;keys are pressed (again, keyboard users).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this in a lot of code bases. I’ve seen it in a lot of demos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve had arguments with a very prominent React thought leader whose name starts with R who insisted that using a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; was “more accessible” than using a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and that Twitter made the right decision in using this pattern in their app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s wrong. It’s all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “fixes” aren’t&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many HTML elements have implicit roles that tell assistive tech like screen readers what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is one of them. It has an implicit &lt;code&gt;[role]&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt;, which tells screen reader users it can be interacted with and will trigger some type of behavior in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTML &lt;code&gt;[role]&lt;/code&gt; attribute can be used to add or modify the role of an element. And so, folks like React Ry–thought-leader-guy will say stuff like (I’m paraphrasing)…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That attribute exists for a reason. You can add&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[role="button"]&lt;/code&gt;to a&lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;to give it the correct semantics.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, that addresses one issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That role doesn’t affect focusability (or lack thereof) or keyboard behavior. Visually impaired users and people who navigate with a keyboard still can’t use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No worries!” they say. “We can fix that, too!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can make the element focusable with the &lt;code&gt;[tabindex]&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div 
	onclick="showSignIn()"
	tabindex="0"
&amp;gt;
	Open Modal
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t, though! Seriously, just don’t fuck with focus order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s way too easy to go down this path and then fuck it up and have folks jumping all over the page instead of navigating through in the normal and expected order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And again, still no keyboard interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But don’t fear! You can add that, too. You just need to listen for all &lt;code&gt;keydown&lt;/code&gt; events, and then filter them out by &lt;code&gt;event.key&lt;/code&gt; so that you only run your code if the &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Spacebar&lt;/code&gt; keys were pressed (the latter means checking for a literal space: &lt;code&gt;' '&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That can’t run on the element, either. You’ve got to attach that even to the &lt;code&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; and figure out which element has focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) =&amp;gt; {

	// Only run on Enter and Spacebar presses
	if (event.key !== 'Enter' &amp;amp; event.key !== ' ') return;

	// Make sure the element you care about how focus
	const notRealBtn = document.activeElement.closest('[onclick]');
	if (!notRealBtn) return;

	// Run your code, somehow...

});
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So um… ok, I guess it is technically a fix, but…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You’ve just recreated all of the functionality a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives you for free&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously, WTF would you do that?!?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these hoops to write this HTML…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div 
	onclick="showSignIn()"
	tabindex="0"
&amp;gt;
	Open Modal
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you could write this HTML instead…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button onclick="showSignIn()"&amp;gt;
	Open Modal
&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Has the correct &lt;code&gt;[role]&lt;/code&gt;implicitly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is automatically focusable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fires a &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt;event in response to&lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Spacebar&lt;/code&gt;presses when it has focus.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I’m a lazy developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I suspect, if you’re someone who loves tools like React, you probably are, too. It’s cool, I get it! The best code is the code you didn’t write and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, be even lazier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the correct element for the job, and avoid writing a bunch of extra code!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fire TV: Amazon to block piracy apps in the future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piracy apps installed on Fire TV devices via sideloading will be rendered unusable based on a blacklist from the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has installed an app on their Fire TV device or player that allows illegal access to copyrighted content must expect to no longer be able to use it in the future. The background is that Amazon will actively take action against such piracy apps starting today, Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the manufacturer will compare the applications installed on the devices with a blacklist maintained by the anti-piracy coalition ACE (Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment). This includes numerous media and streaming companies, including Apple TV+, BBC Studios, Canal+, Comcast, Fox, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount Global, Sony Pictures, and The Walt Disney Company, in addition to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videos by heise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to an inquiry, Amazon explained that it has always worked to ban piracy from its app store. As part of an expanded program led by the ACE, it is now blocking apps that demonstrably provide access to pirated content, including those downloaded outside the app store. This builds on Amazon's ongoing efforts to support creators and protect customers, as piracy can also expose users to malware, viruses, and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Two-stage process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon does not block the relevant apps immediately, but first notifies the user for a certain period that these are applications that should not be used. The company has not yet commented on how long users will receive the notification before the application is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to an inquiry, Amazon explained that it will continue to be possible to install apps via so-called sideloading from a source besides the official app store. They understand that this is a valuable tool for developers. Consequently, the new measures are intended to be limited to piracy apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sideloading still possible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sideloading option will remain available on Fire TV devices running Amazon's new operating system, Vega OS. However, it is generally limited to developers here. In this context, the company emphasized that, contrary to rumors, there are no plans to upgrade existing Fire TV devices with Fire OS as the operating system to Vega OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fire TV players are repeatedly offered on the internet with piracy apps that are supposed to enable free access to IPTV or VoD content. During c't's research on main topic streaming and piracy, it turned out that in several cases apps were pre-installed that, without the user's knowledge, redistributed received content via Bittorrent, with the result that users might unexpectedly receive warning letters from the film industry.
