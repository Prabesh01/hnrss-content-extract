    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;zig libc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author: Andrew Kelley&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past month or so, several enterprising contributors have taken an interest in the zig libc subproject. The idea here is to incrementally delete redundant code, by providing libc functions as Zig standard library wrappers rather than as vendored C source files. In many cases, these functions are one-to-one mappings, such as &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt;, or trivially wrap a generic function, like &lt;code&gt;strnlen&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fn strnlen(str: [*:0]const c_char, max: usize) callconv(.c) usize {
    return std.mem.findScalar(u8, @ptrCast(str[0..max]), 0) orelse max;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, roughly 250 C source files have been deleted from the Zig repository, with 2032 remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With each function that makes the transition, Zig gains independence from third party projects and from the C programming language, compilation speed improves, Zigâs installation size is simplified and reduced, and user applications which statically link libc enjoy reduced binary size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a recent enhancement now makes zig libc share the Zig Compilation Unit with other Zig code rather than being a separate static archive, linked together later. This is one of the advantages of Zig having an integrated compiler and linker. When the exported libc functions share the ZCU, redundant code is eliminated because functions can be optimized together. Itâs kind of like enabling LTO (Link-Time Optimization) across the libc boundary, except itâs done properly in the frontend instead of too late, in the linker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when this work is combined with the recent std.Io changes, there is potential for users to seamlessly control how libc performs I/O - for example forcing all calls to &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; to participate in an io_uring event loop, even though that code was not written with such use case in mind. Or, resource leak detection could be enabled for third-party C code. For now this is only a vaporware idea which has not been experimented with, but the idea intrigues me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thanks to Szabolcs Nagy for libc-test. This project has been a huge help in making sure that we donât regress any math functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a reminder to our users, now that Zig is transitioning to being the static libc provider, if you encounter issues with the musl, mingw-w64, or wasi-libc libc functionality provided by Zig, please file bug reports in Zig first so we donât annoy maintainers for bugs that are in Zig, and no longer vendored by independent libc implementation projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abolish ICE.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing the Codex app for macOS—a powerful new interface designed to effortlessly manage multiple agents at once, run work in parallel, and collaborate with agents over long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're also excited to show more people what's now possible with Codex. For a limited time we're including Codex with ChatGPT Free and Go, and we're doubling the rate limits on Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans. Those higher limits apply everywhere you use Codex—in the app, from the CLI, in your IDE, and in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app changes how software gets built and who can build it—from pairing with a single coding agent on targeted edits to supervising coordinated teams of agents across the full lifecycle of designing, building, shipping, and maintaining software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we launched Codex in April 2025, the way developers work with agents has fundamentally changed. Models are now capable of handling complex, long-running tasks end to end and developers are now orchestrating multiple agents across projects: delegating work, running tasks in parallel, and trusting agents to take on substantial projects that can span hours, days, or weeks. The core challenge has shifted from what agents can do to how people can direct, supervise, and collaborate with them at scale—existing IDEs and terminal-based tools are not built to support this way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new way of building coupled with new model capabilities demands a different kind of tool, which is why we are introducing the Codex desktop app, a command center for agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app provides a focused space for multi-tasking with agents. Agents run in separate threads organized by projects, so you can seamlessly switch between tasks without losing context. The app lets you review the agent’s changes in the thread, comment on the diff, and even open it in your editor to make manual changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also includes built-in support for worktrees, so multiple agents can work on the same repo without conflicts. Each agent works on an isolated copy of your code, allowing you to explore different paths without needing to track how they impact your codebase. As an agent works, you can check out changes locally or let it continue making progress without touching your local git state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app picks up your session history and configuration from the Codex CLI and IDE extension, so you can immediately start using it with your existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is evolving from an agent that writes code into one that uses code to get work done on your computer. With skills(opens in a new window), you can easily extend Codex beyond code generation to tasks that require gathering and synthesizing information, problem-solving, writing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills bundle instructions, resources, and scripts so Codex can reliably connect to tools, run workflows, and complete tasks according to your team’s preferences. The Codex app includes a dedicated interface to create and manage skills. You can explicitly ask Codex to use specific skills, or let it automatically use them based on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked Codex to make a racing game, complete with different racers, eight maps, and even items players could use with the space bar. Using an image generation skill(opens in a new window) (powered by GPT Image) and a web game development skill(opens in a new window), Codex built the game by working independently using more than 7 million tokens with just one initial user prompt. It took on the roles of designer, game developer, and QA tester to validate its work by actually playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve included the game, as well as the prompt and skills used to create it, below. You can also try out earlier iterations to see how Codex improved it as it worked for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At OpenAI, we’ve built hundreds of skills internally to help multiple teams confidently delegate work to Codex that would otherwise be hard to define consistently—from running evals and babysitting training runs to drafting documentation and reporting on growth experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app includes a library of skills for tools and workflows that have become popular at OpenAI, with a few highlighted below. You can find the full list in the open source repo(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement designs: Fetch design context, assets, and screenshots from Figma(opens in a new window) and translate them into production-ready UI code with 1:1 visual parity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manage projects: Triage bugs, track releases, manage team workload, and more in Linear(opens in a new window) to keep projects moving.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deploy to the cloud: Have Codex deploy your web app creations to popular cloud hosts like Cloudflare(opens in a new window), Netlify(opens in a new window), Render(opens in a new window), and Vercel(opens in a new window).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate images: Use the image generation skill(opens in a new window) powered by GPT Image to create and edit images to use in websites, UI mockups, product visuals, and game assets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build with OpenAI APIs: Reference up-to-date documentation(opens in a new window) when building with OpenAI APIs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create documents: A set of skills for reading, creating, and editing PDF(opens in a new window), spreadsheet(opens in a new window), and docx(opens in a new window) files with professional formatting and layouts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you create a new skill in the app, Codex can use it wherever you work: in the app, CLI or in your IDE extension. You can also check skills into your repository to make them available to your entire team. Read more about sharing skills using team config here(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Codex app, you can also set up Automations that let Codex work in the background on an automatic schedule. Automations combine instructions with optional skills, running on a schedule you define. When an Automation finishes, the results land in a review queue so you can jump back in and continue working if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At OpenAI, we’ve been using Automations to handle the repetitive but important tasks, like daily issue triage, finding and summarizing CI failures, generating daily release briefs, checking for bugs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers have different preferences in how they work with an agent. Some want a blunt, execution-focused partner; others prefer more communicative, engaging interactions. Codex now lets developers choose between two personalities—a terse, pragmatic style and a more conversational, empathetic one, without any change in capabilities, to fit the approach you like the most. Just use the /personality command in the app, CLI, and IDE extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about how to set up and use the Codex app in the docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re integrating security by design across the entire Codex agent stack. The Codex app uses native, open-source(opens in a new window) and configurable system-level sandboxing just like in the Codex CLI. By default, Codex agents are limited to editing files in the folder or branch where they’re working and using cached web search, then asking for permission to run commands that require elevated permissions like network access. You can configure rules(opens in a new window) for your project or team that allows certain commands to automatically run with elevated permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app is available starting today on macOS. Anyone with a ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise or Edu subscription can use Codex across the CLI, web, IDE-extension and app with their ChatGPT login. Usage is included in ChatGPT subscriptions, with the option to purchase additional credits if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a limited time, Codex will also be available to ChatGPT Free and Go users to help build more with agents. We’re also doubling rate limits for existing Codex users across all paid plans during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprises and developers increasingly rely on Codex for end-to-end development. Since the launch of GPT‑5.2-Codex in mid-December, overall Codex usage has doubled, and in the past month, more than a million developers have used Codex. We’ll continue to expand where and how developers can use Codex, including making the app available on Windows, pushing the frontier of model capabilities, and rolling out faster inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the app, we’ll keep refining multi-agent workflows based on real-world feedback, making it easier to manage parallel work and move between agents without losing context. We’re also building out Automations with support for cloud-based triggers, so Codex can run continuously in the background—not just when your computer is open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is built on a simple premise: everything is controlled by code. The better an agent is at reasoning about and producing code, the more capable it becomes across all forms of technical and knowledge work. Yet a key challenge today is the gap between what frontier models are capable of and how easily people can use them in practice. Codex is designed to close that gap by making it easier to direct, supervise, and apply the full intelligence of our models to real work. We’ve focused on making Codex the best coding agent, which has also laid the foundation for it to become a strong agent for a broad range of knowledge work tasks that extend beyond writing code. We’re excited to see what you build with Codex!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We initially reached out to @dae to explore collaborating more closely on improving Anki. We were both humbled and shocked when he asked if we’d be willing to step into a much larger leadership role than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point, we’re mostly excited…and also feeling a healthy amount of terror. This is a big responsibility. It will push us to grow as individuals, as a team, and as a community, and we don’t take that lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re grateful for the trust Damien and others have placed in us. And we also know that trust has to be earned, especially from people who don’t know us yet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We Believe&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We believe Anki is almost sacred, something bigger than any one person or organization. In an important sense, it belongs to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This article highlights the principles Damien built Anki on; principles we deeply share, such as respect for user agency, refusal of manipulative design patterns, and an emphasis on the craft of building genuinely useful tools that aren’t merely engaging. Anki has never tried to maximize “engagement” by exploiting psychological vulnerabilities purely for profit. Anki gives your time back to you, and that is an exceptional rarity in this world that we want to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As an organization built by students, for students, our mission is to continue embodying these principles. We are accountable only to you, our users, not external investors, and we plan to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We Don’t Know Yet&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We can’t answer every question right away, as there are many unknowns since much hasn’t been decided yet. But we are sharing everything we can now because the community is important to us. We encourage you all to share your thoughts and questions – we’re all in this together!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re still working through the details on things like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Governance and decision-making: How decisions are made, who has final say, and how the community is heard&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Roadmap and priorities: What gets built when and how to balance competing needs&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;The transition itself: How to bring in more support without disrupting what already works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anki has shown how powerful community collaboration can be when it’s genuinely a group effort, and that’s a tradition we are honored to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re currently talking to David Allison, a long-time core contributor to AnkiDroid, about working together on exactly these questions. His experience with AnkiDroid’s collaborative development is invaluable, and we’re grateful he’s willing to help us get this right. We’re incredibly excited to have him join us full-time to help propel Anki into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We’re Aiming For&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;UI/UX improvements. We’re bringing professional design expertise on board to make it more approachable without sacrificing Anki’s power. We believe that principled design will bring meaningful quality of life improvements to power users and novices alike.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Addressing the bus factor. The ecosystem shouldn’t be in jeopardy if any one person disappears. We want to build software that lives beyond any single contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Supporting more than just med students. AnkiHub grew out of the medical education community, but Anki serves learners from all walks of life, and we want to support everyone to achieve their learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A more robust add-on ecosystem. We’d love to build tools that empower non-technical users to customize Anki for their needs, and we’re exploring add-ons that work everywhere, including mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How We’ll Work&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to provide transparency into the decision-making process, taking inspiration from proven models to:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Give the community clarity on how to be heard and give feedback&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Make it clear how decisions are made and why&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Set realistic expectations&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Define roles and responsibilities so things don’t fall through the cracks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to bring everyone in the global Anki community together into a closer collaboration focused on building the best learning tools possible. Today, these groups often work in silos; a more unified process will help everyone move Anki forward together.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sustainability&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some practical reassurances:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sustainability, affordability, and accessibility. We’re committed to a sustainable business model that keeps Anki accessible and prioritizes user needs above profits. If anything ever needs to change, we’ll be transparent about why.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; No enshittification. We’ve seen what happens when VC-backed companies acquire beloved tools. That’s not what this is. There are no investors involved, and we’re not here to extract value from something the community built together. Building in the right safeguards and processes to handle pressure without stifling necessary improvements is something we’re actively considering.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re grateful to Damien et all for their trust and support, and grateful to all of you for the passion that makes this community so special.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We welcome your questions, concerns, and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; – The AnkiHub Team&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is AnkiHub?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub is a small education technology company founded by two long-time Anki nerds: Nick, a resident physician known as The AnKing, and Andrew Sanchez, a research software engineer. AnkiHub grew out of years of obsessive Anki use and firsthand experience with both its power and its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub began as a way to collaborate on Anki decks (such as the AnKing Step Deck for medical students) and has since evolved into a broader effort to improve the Anki ecosystem by building tools that help more people benefit from Anki.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will Anki remain open source?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Absolutely. Anki’s core code will remain open source, guided by the same principles that have guided the project from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are there any changes planned to Anki’s pricing?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No. We are committed to fair pricing that supports users rather than exploiting them. Both Anki and AnkiHub are already profitable. Any future decisions will be made with community benefit, user value, and long-term project health in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is Anki in financial trouble?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No. The transition is driven by the goal of helping Anki reach its full potential, not by financial issues. Our goal is to build a resilient structure and accelerate development.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is the timeline?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our intention is to build confidence and earn trust while making gradual changes. The transition will be transparent, with clear communication throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happens to volunteer contributors and community developers?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Volunteer contributors will always be essential to Anki. Our goal is to make it easier to collaborate meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will the mobile apps change or be removed from the app stores?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mobile apps will continue to be maintained and supported. Additional development capacity should help with faster updates, better testing, and more consistent improvements across platforms over time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How much influence will investors or external partners have on Anki after the transition?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;None. Both Anki and AnkiHub are entirely self-funded. There are no outside investors dictating product decisions, growth targets, or monetization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with AnkiHub?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub will continue to operate as usual, but now our teams are working together to improve both solutions. The only change you should notice is that, over time, everything becomes much easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ll share more updates as they happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with the current AnkiHub subscriptions?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub subscriptions enhance Anki with collaborative features, shared deck syncing, and LLM-based features and that isn’t changing at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with AnkiDroid?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiDroid will remain an open-source, self-governed project. There are no plans or agreements regarding AnkiDroid.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will decisions be made and communicated?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anki is open-source, and we will build on and improve its current decision-making processes. We will work in public whenever possible and seek consensus from core contributors. Significant decisions, choices, and their outcomes will be documented on GitHub or in the source code. When a change materially affects users or developers, the reasoning behind it and its impact will be communicated publicly. In the coming weeks, we will work on defining a more formal governance model to set clear expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will there be a public governance model, advisory board, or other accountability structure?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re exploring what makes sense here, and we don’t want to rush it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Historically, Anki has relied more on trust and stewardship than on formal governance. We want to preserve that spirit while improving transparency. Our goal is to establish a governance structure that supports the community and improves clarity and accountability without burdensome bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will the transition affect add-ons and their developers?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Add-ons are a critical part of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our intent is to make life easier for add-on developers: clearer APIs, better documentation, fewer breaking changes, and more predictable release cycles. The goal is not to lock down or restrict the add-on space, but rather to enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What new resources will Anki gain through this transition?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The biggest change is bandwidth by enabling more people to work on Anki without everything being bottlenecked through a single person. This will take time, but will eventually translate into more engineering, design, and support capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What steps will be taken to make Anki more accessible, stable, and beginner-friendly?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a lot of low-hanging fruit that we plan to tackle: improving onboarding for new users, polishing rough edges, and addressing long-standing usability issues. These are exactly the kinds of improvements that have been difficult to tackle under constant time pressure, and we’re excited to invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will community feedback still meaningfully influence the project’s direction?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yes. Anki exists because of its community: users, contributors, add-on developers, translators, and educators. Feedback won’t always translate into immediate changes, but it will always be heard, considered, and respected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will trust be built with users who are skeptical or anxious about the change?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Trust isn’t something you demand; it’s something you earn over time. We intend to build trust through consistent actions: honoring commitments, avoiding surprises, communicating clearly, and demonstrating that Anki’s values haven’t changed. We hope our past actions will give you some peace of mind, but we also understand the skepticism, and we’re prepared to meet it with patience and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is no fan of renewable energy, but it reserves special ire for wind power. Trump himself has repeatedly made false statements about the cost of wind power, its use around the world, and its environmental impacts. That animosity was paired with an executive order that blocked all permitting for offshore wind and some land-based projects, an order that has since been thrown out by a court that ruled it arbitrary and capricious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not content to block all future developments, the administration has also gone after the five offshore wind projects currently under construction. After temporarily blocking two of them for reasons that were never fully elaborated, the Department of the Interior settled on a single justification for blocking turbine installation: a classified national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The response to that late-December announcement has been uniform: The companies building each of the projects sued the administration. As of Monday, every single one of them has achieved the same result: a temporary injunction that allows them to continue construction. This, despite the fact that the suits were filed in three different courts and heard by four different judges.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a program so that I could paint in aquarelle. I take pages from the treasure and paint them: the sky of Varennes on the night of 2 Messidor; a sagittal cut of Saint Sebastian, whose arrows are cylindric sections; Miranda gazing at the sea, waiting to be relieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At times I include Julia in the scene, in whatever clothes it wears at the time, as though we had always known Julia, and had been reared under its gaze. Thus a flaming halo presides over the battle of Lepanto, and a mirror sphere watches the waters of the Sous. And what would the first astronomers have made of Julia? The wanderers, the flame-haired stars are knowable: think you of the Antikythera device, of the Metonic cycle, of Kepler’s nested solids. Julia is indescribable and incompressible: its appearance has never recurred. Had we known Julia from childhood, we would never have believed in the system of the world, that God is made of algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always believed our secret purpose is to wait out Julia: to catch a repetition and redeem our faith that the universe is finite and space is discretized. That there are fixed laws and the world is knowable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A system with a finite number of states must repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am six hundred meters in major diameter, forty meters in minor diameter. I mass nine hundred thousand tons. I have turned two hundred and forty million times. I am glass and wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was born and died on Earth, but I died foolishly, and for that reason my encephalon was laminated, and I was brought to the stars to be immured here. They took my language center, the Chomsky organ, so that I could not complain of my condition. I do not mind it. I can paint in aquarelle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They wired the alarms—of airless rooms and freezing cold and power outages—to the nociceptors, and were I sensible I would be in great pain, for most of me is airless, frozen, and unlit. Therefore I have cut the afferent nerves. I am made of absences, I feel the contours of the absences, where air leaks into vacuum, atom by atom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have use of the antenna. At times I exhale a sphere of microwave light, close my eyes and listen. And I hear the flotsam echoing back: a discarded tank, a glass strut, a sheet of mylar; Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned, who trails us in our orbit. Julia reflects no light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a little redoubt of warmth and air, an island of stability that I preserve against the cold lightless void. There live the last two of the crew, like Miranda, waiting to be relieved. For one hundred and nine years there have been two, Dr. Brouwer and Dr. Cartan. They take turns in the dewar, to draw out the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In time, when the machines are irreparable and the air stale, I will offer them euthanasia or lamination. But suicide is a sin, and having known me they will not bear lamination. They will go into the dewar together, and I will watch over them unto the final days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Julia emits light, over an ever-changing spectrum. But the stars are brighter and much larger, that is why we found it by accident. They pointed a telescope at Vela and exposed it for a month, and there it was: a faint pixel, the wrong colours. They thought it was a fault in the instrument, until they looked closer: twin spirals of light, symmetrical and self-similar, receding beyond measure. And the world was changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Julia, your Janus-face launched a thousand ships. Do you know it? Julia, do you know how we exerted ourselves to reach you? All the riches of Croesus, multiplied a thousandfold, were every year heaped up on an altar, and burned that we might see you. And the brightest of us: embalmed and catapulted to the stars like human sacrifices, returned after a century without answers to a world of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a fleet of ships, launched them once a decade, immense towers of glass and lithium deuteride. Cycling bodies back and forth in perpetuity. There and back in twelve decades. They made my body out of a comet, threaded my nerves through its passages. Julia, you are our only effort. Do you know it? There is nothing else to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for what purpose? We know the system of the world, every field and every particle. And Julia answered: “I refute it thus”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see a coffin, hoisted by a chain, rise from a sea of liquid nitrogen. The arms of the surgeon minister to its contents. In six days the heart resumes its beating, the lungs draw air, Dr. Cartan lives again. Her face is burned with ice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She touches her neck. She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the cannula goes. Their bodies attest to the passage of time, as does mine. This is a commonality. Dr. Brouwer arrives and they hug. They spend some months together, between shifts in the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present Julia is a cloud of gray smoke with green bruises, like ghosting in a CRT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can read, but not write. I write by an algebraic process—the universe is a string rewriting system. This is how I compose these words to you: by the expansion of non-terminal symbols in a production system. They took my language center. Turing is my patron saint: language is the transitive closure of a rewrite relation. I choose my words from a list. In time I will learn to speak aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spoke to Earth: quarterly, annual, decadal reports; journal articles for the Acta Juliana. I heard back ill-omens, then silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the last ship had come and gone, there had been one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-nine crew entrusted to me. Their numbers were ground down, as all things are, gradually and suddenly. There had been two shuttles, Baghdad and Afrasiab. There had been two mutinies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afrasiab took one hundred and twenty souls, and the last matter compiler; to an airless unlit rock said to exist around Luhman 16B. Think you of Aristagoras, how much easier it is to deceive the many than the few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baghdad with thirty souls had gone to Julia. Stranger, I saw them. I saw the engine light wane to a grain of sand indistinguishable from the fixed stars, and I saw the stars shift, like sand, and they were not stars but Julia who wore a garment like a pit of star-scaled vipers. And over the radio they sang le temps des cerises, and the engine light became another scale in a river of living water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A thousand miles from Julia’s barycenter, in the space of a breath, the radio dopplered away to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sixty years after Baghdad had gone, I heard a voice from Earth, praying for rain, who said it had not rained for three years. Silence again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are cold, under a sheet of mylar. I pump heat into the room and it escapes. They speak of Julia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan believes that Julia is of divine origin, that it is like an hourglass, counting down to the last hour, when God will sweep away the Creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Brouwer believes Julia is a high-dimensional object, and, as it traverses the universe, we see a changing three-dimensional projection of it. Thus the apparent changes are a trick of perspective: we see successive cuts of a fixed structure. Julian sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always believed this must be true, because Julia’s changes are effortless, and without inertia: it is as though nothing moves, and a veil is being lifted, revealing a structure that is already there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this theory, unlike most, is testable: when Julia’s transit is complete it will disappear from the universe, and never again will it be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan holds out hope that rescuers will come. Dr. Brouwer says they are forgotten, like the Roman soldier at Pompei, he says they should have gone with Baghdad, and drowned inside Julia. He is crying. Dr. Cartan holds him close, and says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Paul, Paul, have hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish that I could touch them, and comfort them. I am glass and wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shift had come, and Dr. Brouwer lay down on the slab, and the surgeon embalmed him, and lowered him into the dewar. Dr. Cartan bent over the console, and wept, and I tried to speak aloud, and to say,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Virginia, Virginia, have courage! You are not alone, I am with you, have courage!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I heard a sound like a man drowning in wet sand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dreamt that I held in my hands the double-handed golden vase of Thetis. And in my hands it melted, the delicate reliefs coarsened and flowed. And I held, in the hollow of my hands, though I have no hands, I held a pool of flowing gold, the colour of treason, and minute points of black floated there, and, as ships without sails are borne by the currents, they seemed to come together, and almost to spell words in some divine language, where they came apart again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am here. Dr. Cartan is here. In the control room. The screens are pale yellow, the colour has run from them. The largest of them reminds her there is a world outside the walls: Luhman 16, a pair of cold Jupiters, haloed with unlit shoals and islands; Julia, seventy AU away, ninety degrees from the ecliptic, is not bound by gravity (for Julia has no mass) but by an unknown process tracks the velocity vector of the system barycenter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present Julia is a cavern of molten gold, shot through with pillars of liquid metal. Its surface is marred with storms and tempests, like an ocean of amber light. And I think of Baghdad, that swam under the storm horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan is running through a checklist for the ten thousandth time. She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the cannula goes. She is testing the antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I exhaled and shut my eyes, and counted the returns. I heard the usual flotsam, and Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned. And nothing else. I keep a strict inventory of cisjulian space. A million kilometers in all directions: nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A moment passes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microwave light on my skin, from the direction of Luhman 16B. I looked through the telescope, Dr. Cartan looked over my shoulder. Almost on top of us, the bow of a ship: an eyeless white dome hiding the antenna, two cameras like the headlamps of an old car. I swept it with RADAR, it shot back a key exchange, signed with Afrasiab’s private key. The sea gives up her dead: is this the last hour?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan drops to her knees, staring up at the screen like a supplicant. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Paul, Paul, we are saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afrasiab. As if the tides had pushed it back to shore. After one hundred and nine years of silence. No, I deny it. I deny the reality of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The radio flared with human voices. From Earth? I thought of jazz and wind and the September ocean and—no, no, forgive me: I am a fool, and I died foolishly. Not from Earth, of course. From Afrasiab. From the dead. The dead can speak. I am ashamed. I choose my words from a list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at Afrasiab through the radiometer, and it was cold as liquid helium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human voices, warm and alive. They said they had succeeded, that they had found a comet, and made a home in it, that it had taken decades and dozens had died but they had made a home, that they had working matter compilers, caverns of ice filled with light and fruit trees, children and families and clean water, rivers and medicine and gravity. They spoke through tears and their voice broke, and they said that not all is lost, that they had made a foothold for mankind, that from thirty-three they had grown to three hundred, that they had sent the ship with a skeleton crew to save them, to bring them to the light and air.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to speak aloud, and to say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Virginia, Virginia, it is an apparition, they do not live, they have been dead for a hundred years; Virginia, nothing human lives there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a sound like a flash flood, like air rushing out of a sinking ship. And no-one heard me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I watched her go: she took the tram up the spoke, swam unlighted corridors. I tried to flash SOS but the lights were dead and there was only the golden light of Julia through the glass hull. I flexed a phantom limb. In distant and disused corridors there were arcs of electricity, and pipes burst, and doors shut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I swept the RADAR side to side, across the bow of Afrasiab, as if to say: No. Go away. No. And no-one heard me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to say one word, stop, and there was a sound like wind-blown sand. Virginia, forgive me. I tried to speak aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She made it to the airlock, a little room, the size of a Soyuz capsule, that projected from the hub. There was a hatch with a porthole and she took the handles and watched fixedly as Afrasiab came closer, waiting to greet her rescuers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The floodlights on Afrasiab came on, and swept my skin drunkenly, and the cargo nets traced Cartesian shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without hope I pointed the antenna at Julia, and I wanted to say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Julia, Julia, not unto them! Julia, I pray to you, not unto them!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I choose my words from a list, and I said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“JULIA JULIA NO NO NO NO NO NO NO”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And no-one heard me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And dread gave way to anger, and I wanted to stand, and to leap upon Afrasiab, and strangle it, and crush its head with my teeth, and tear the skin from its flesh, and the flesh from its bones, and mix our blood, and fall dead, bled white: that I might die again, but not in vain. I am glass and wire. Virginia, forgive me: I cannot die again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downrange a hundred meters Afrasiab began to yaw, so that its broad side, with its sole airlock, faced the hub. The front two-thirds looked as I remembered: a ship, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final third, where the engines should have been, was made of Julia. Where there should have been tanks and an engine bell there was an exclave of Julia: a living sculpture, like coiled ropes of liquid gold, like tentacles whose tips fold into infinitesimal spirals. And all along their length the ropes are garlanded with burning flowers, flowers whose petals are yellow oceans. And in the oceans there are islands and continents, black on yellow, like wax on gold leaf. And on the continents there are mountains and valleys, and orange groves, and abandoned watchtowers, paper cities denuded of people with wooden palaces stepped like the pyramids, and through a window in a palace, an iron pot suspended by a chain over a static fire, a suit of armor, a wall painted in aquarelle: two armies of lancers in a mountain landscape, and the mountains are shaped like clouds, and I think this is Tiflis and these are the three hundred Aragvians, immured here for all time, and I know that this is false: for all of this is Julia. And in the black eyes of a Qajar horseman, between the black of the iris and the black of the aperture there is an arc of ocean, and in the ocean there are islands, and chains of islands, and verdigris waters and the outlines of sunken ships, coral growths on a brass sextant, and a little distance from the shore, amid the green, there is a clearing and a lake of transparent water, sand sculpted into faint ridges, and archaic fish, fixed in space, suspended in contorted poses, whose scales are pink and light blue, and where a scale catches the light there is an empty vastness of white, a salt ocean, blindingly white, interrupted by crags of black stone, and a city whose walls are made of salt, and empty buildings of gray stone, squat sloped barracks and tall, thin spires, and streets of white tile, and windows opening into oil-black darkness, and no people, a universe in black and white. And I wondered who had built this city, and who had lived here, and why they had deserted it, and I know there is no answer: for all of this is Julia. And in a courtyard there was colour, a sand mandala of Cantor’s garden, ringed by Mount Qaf, and all the gardens of the Persian emperor would not have filled the least part of this garden; for here was every tree and every flower, tended by the hands of the archangels, not only those that men have seen, not only yellow roses and the cedars of Lebanon, but all flowers in indenumerable combinations: at the midpoint between flowers $a$ and $b$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$, and between $a$ and $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,\mathfrak{C}[a,b]]$, and analogously between $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ and $b$, and this process of interpolation continues without end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I saw every flower in Cantor’s garden. And my heart was rent with awe, and I would cry tears of joy, that I had been shown beauty without end; when my heart was hollowed out, and filled with everlasting grief, by an alien cruelty that says, this beauty is empty: for all of this is Julia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the apex of the garden there is a pool of water the colour of tarnished silver, shaped like a sunspot, and in the blackness there are faint impurities, trails of minute light, like diatoms, like shadows in a pool, and I saw they were strings of galaxies, and I followed them, and a faint light grew into a sea of stars. And in the star-sea I saw two unlit stars, divine Julia, a glass wheel, a ghost ship, and the porthole of the airlock, and through it I saw Dr. Cartan, who wore the face of those who have seen God.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I describe these things serially, but I saw all of them simultaneously. It was but a moment. Only a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afrasiab had come to a stop in front of the airlock, broadside facing us, as though it were an ambassador presenting its credentials, awaiting a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The airlock burst open—I was distracted. Too late. She must have pulled the cord. In the space of a breath the air rushed out and her head smashed against the frame, and smeared it red. And her body shot out, spinning like a discus, trailing a spiral of still-warm blood, a galaxy of hemocytes. Virginia, you are a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She passed through Afrasiab as a knife passes through smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as though it had been found out, the floodlights turned off. There was a pause, and Afrasiab drew back, like a javelin being shouldered, and it threw itself at me in a long, elegant arc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You, who find these words among the ruins, I pray to you: gather up our bones, let not my ashes be buried apart from theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where it struck me there was no weight, there was nothing, not a breath of air, rien; and though there was nothing, I was struck by a divine wind, and Afrasiab became a cloud of Cantor dust, and faded like smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No weight. A divine wind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bones of solid diamond a meter thick split clean, as though the electrons withdrew in fear. Their sovereign commanded them to part, and they parted. My bones were broken. And there was no sound nor violence, but an ordered separation of all things. I watched myself come apart. Like smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No sound—a knife through smoke. The crew of Baghdad sing le temps des cerises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not afraid. I tried to speak aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Research done as part of the first Anthropic Fellows Program during Summer 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When AI systems fail, will they fail by systematically pursuing the wrong goals, or by being a hot mess? We decompose the errors of frontier reasoning models into bias (systematic) and variance (incoherent) components and find that, as tasks get harder and reasoning gets longer, model failures become increasingly dominated by incoherence rather than systematic misalignment. This suggests that future AI failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of a goal we did not train them to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with increasingly consequential tasks. This makes understanding how these systems might fail even more critical for safety. A central concern in AI alignment is that superintelligent systems might coherently pursue misaligned goals: the classic paperclip maximizer scenario. But there's another possibility: AI might fail not through systematic misalignment, but through incoherence—unpredictable, self-undermining behavior that doesn't optimize for any consistent objective. That is, AI might fail in the same way that humans often fail, by being a hot mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper builds on the hot mess theory of misalignment (Sohl-Dickstein, 2023), which surveyed experts to rank various entities (including humans, animals, machine learning models, and organizations) by intelligence and coherence independently. It found that smarter entities are subjectively judged to behave less coherently. We take this hypothesis from survey data to empirical measurement across frontier AI systems, asking: As models become more intelligent and tackle harder tasks, do their failures look more like systematic misalignment, or more like a hot mess?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify incoherence we decompose AI errors using the classic bias-variance framework:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We define incoherence as the fraction of error attributable to variance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An incoherence of 0 means all errors are systematic (classic misalignment risk). An incoherence of 1 means all errors are random (the hot mess scenario). Crucially, this metric is independent of overall performance: a model can improve while becoming more or less coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated frontier&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across all tasks and models, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent they become. This holds whether we measure reasoning tokens, agent actions, or optimizer steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does incoherence change with model scale? The answer depends on task difficulty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests that scaling alone won't eliminate incoherence. As more capable models tackle harder problems, variance-dominated failures persist or worsen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We find that when models spontaneously reason longer on a problem (compared to their median), incoherence spikes dramatically. Meanwhile, deliberately increasing reasoning budgets through API settings provides only modest coherence improvements. The natural variation dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aggregating multiple samples reduces variance (as expected from theory), providing a path to more coherent behavior, though this may be impractical for real-world agentic tasks where actions are irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key conceptual point: LLMs are dynamical systems, not optimizers. When a language model generates text or takes actions, it traces trajectories through a high-dimensional state space. It has to be trained to act as an optimizer, and trained to align with human intent. It's unclear which of these properties will be more robust as we scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraining a generic dynamical system to act as a coherent optimizer is extremely difficult. Often the number of constraints required for monotonic progress toward a goal grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the state space. We shouldn't expect AI to act as coherent optimizers without considerable effort, and this difficulty doesn't automatically decrease with scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To probe this directly, we designed a controlled experiment: train transformers to explicitly emulate an optimizer. We generate training data from steepest descent on a quadratic loss function, then train models of varying sizes to predict the next optimization step given the current state (essentially: training a "mesa-optimizer").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results are evidence that future AI failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of goals that were not trained for. (Think: the AI intends to run the nuclear power plant, but gets distracted reading French poetry, and there is a meltdown.) However, coherent pursuit of poorly chosen goals that we trained for remains a problem. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the bias-variance decomposition to systematically study how AI incoherence scales with model intelligence and task complexity. The evidence suggests that as AI tackles harder problems requiring more reasoning and action, its failures tend to become increasingly dominated by variance rather than bias. This doesn't eliminate AI risk—but it changes what that risk looks like, particularly for problems that are currently hardest for models, and should inform how we prioritize alignment research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We thank Andrew Saxe, Brian Cheung, Kit Frasier-Taliente, Igor Shilov, Stewart Slocum, Aidan Ewart, David Duvenaud, and Tom Adamczewski for extremely helpful discussions on topics and results in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FLOPPINUX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An Embedded ð§Linux on a Single ð¾Floppy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2025 Edition (v0.3.1)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;FLOPPINUX was released in 2021. After four years people find it helpful. Because of that I decided to revisit FLOPPINUX in 2025 and make updated tutorial. This brings bunch of updates like latest kernel and persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main Project Goals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux Kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64-bit Base OS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Working Directory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System Requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Toolset&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filesystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boot Image&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Floppy Disk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Summary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Main Project Goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of this as Linux From Scratch but for making single floppy distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is meant to be a full workshop (tutorial) that you can follow easily and modify it to your needs. It is a learning exercise. Some base Linux knowledge is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final distribution is very simple and consists only of minimum of tools and hardware support. As a user you will be able to boot any PC with a floppy drive to a Linux terminal, edit files, and create simple scripts. There is 264KB of space left for your newly created files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core features:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully working distribution booting from the single floppy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Latest* Linux kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supporting all 32-bit x86 CPUs since Intel 486DX&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have a working text editor (Vi) and basic file manipulation commands (move, rename, delete, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for simple scripting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent storage on the floppy to actualy save files (264KB)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works on real hardware and emulation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimum Hardware Requirements:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intel 486DX 33MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;20MB RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internal floppy disk&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linux Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel drops i486 support in 6.15 (released May 2025), so 6.14 (released March 2025) is the latest version with full compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;64-bit Base OS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time I will do everything on Omarchy Linux. It is 64-bit operating system based on Arch Linux. Instructions should work on all POSIX systems. Only difference is getting needed packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working Directory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create directory where you will keep all the files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir ~/my-linux-distro/
BASE=~/my-linux-distro/
cd $BASE&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Host OS Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You need supporting software to build things. This exact list may vary depending on the system you have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install needed software/libs. On Arch/Omarchy 3.1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S ncurses bc flex bison syslinux cpio&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-compiler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://musl.cc/i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz
tar xvf i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz
rm i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;86Box is also good but slower. Bochs is the best but for debugging, not needed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For emulation I will be using qemu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S qemu-full&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the sources for the latest compatible kernel 6.14.11:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone --depth=1 --branch v6.14.11 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
cd linux&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that you have them in linux/ directory lets configure and build our custom kernel. First create tiniest base configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 tinyconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a bootstrap with absolute minimum features. Just enough to boot the system. We want a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add additonal config settings on top of it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Do not uncheck anything in options unless specified so. Some of those options are important. You can uncheck but on your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From menus choose those options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;General Setup &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Configure standard kernel features (expert users) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable support for printk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using XZ and uncheck everything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure standard kernel features (expert users) &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Processor type and features &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;x86 CPU resources control support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Processor family &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;486DX&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable the block layer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Executable file formats &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Kernel support for ELF binaries&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Kernel support for scripts starting with #!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Device Drivers &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Block devices &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Normal floppydisk support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;RAM block device support &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Default number of RAM disk: 1&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Character devices &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable TTY&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block devices &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File systems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;DOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;MSDOS fs support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pseudo filesystems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;/proc file system support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sysfs file system support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Native language support &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Codepage 437&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Library routines &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;XZ decompression and uncheck everything under it&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exit configuration (yes, save settings to .config).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time for compiling!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 bzImage -j$(nproc)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will take a while depending on the speed of your CPU. In the end the kernel will be created in arch/x86/boot/ as bzImage file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move kernel to our main directory and go back to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mv arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
cd ..&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toolset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without tools kernel will just boot and you will not be able to do anything. One of the most popular lightweight tools is BusyBox. It replaces the standard GNU utilities with way smaller but still functional alternatives, perfect for embedded needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the 1.36.1 version from busybox.net or Github mirror. Download the file, extract it, and change directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://github.com/mirror/busybox/archive/refs/tags/1_36_1.tar.gz
tar xzvf 1_36_1.tar.gz
rm 1_36_1.tar.gz
cd busybox-1_36_1/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with kernel you need to create starting configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 allnoconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You may skip this following fix if you are building on Debian/Fedora&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix for Arch Linux based distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sed -i 's/main() {}/int main() {}/' scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now the fun part. You need to choose what tools you want. Each menu entry will show how much more KB will be taken if you choose it. So choose it wisely :) For the first time use my selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the configurator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose the following options. Remember to do not uncheck anything if not stated here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Settings &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support files &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;2GB&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Build static binary (no shared libs)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support files &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coreutils &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;cat&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;cp&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;df&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;echo&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ls&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mkdir&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mv&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;rm&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sync&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;test &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;test as [&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;test as [[&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Console Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;clear&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Editors &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;vi&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Init Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;init &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck everything else (inside init: keep [*] only on init in this page)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;init &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux System Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;mdev&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mount &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support lots of -o flags&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck evrything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;umount&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Miscellaneous Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck readahead&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shells &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Choose alias as (ash)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ash&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optimize for size instead of speed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alias support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now exit with save config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cross Compiler Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our target system needs to be 32-bit. To compile it on 64-bit system we need a cross compiler. You can setup this by hand in the menuconfig or just copy and paste those four lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup paths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX.*|CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX=\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross/bin/i486-linux-musl-\"|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_SYSROOT.*|CONFIG_SYSROOT=\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross\"|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/include|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-L$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/lib|" .config&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile BusyBox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build tools and create base filesystem (âinstallâ). It will ask for options, just press enter for default for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 -j$(nproc) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make ARCH=x86 install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will create a filesystem with all the files at **_install/**. Move it to our main directory. I like to rename it to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly to to that new directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mv _install ../filesystem
cd ../filesystem&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Filesystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You got kernel and basic tools but the system still needs some additional directory structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This created minimum viable directory structure for satisfying the basic requirements of a Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the filesystem/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir -pv {dev,proc,etc/init.d,sys,tmp,home}

    &lt;p&gt;Next step is to add minimum configuration files. First one is a welcome message that will be shown after booting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is the first real opportunity to go wild and make this your own signature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; welcome &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
Your welome message or ASCII art.
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or download my welcome file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://krzysztofjankowski.com/floppinux/downloads/0.3.1/welcome&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Back to serious stuff. Inittab tells the system what to do in critical states like starting, exiting and restarting. It points to the initialization script rc that is the first thing that our OS will run before dropping into the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create an inittab file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; etc/inittab &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rc
::askfirst:/bin/sh
::restart:/sbin/init
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the init rc script:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; etc/init.d/rc &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
#!/bin/sh
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys
mdev -s
ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab
mkdir -p /mnt /home
mount -t msdos -o rw /dev/fd0 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/data
mount --bind /mnt/data /home
clear
cat welcome
cd /home
/bin/sh
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make the script executable and owner of all files to root:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x etc/init.d/rc
sudo chown -R root:root .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compress this directory into one file. Then go back to working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;find . | cpio -H newc -o | xz --check=crc32 --lzma2=dict=512KiB -e &amp;gt; ../rootfs.cpio.xz
cd ..&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create booting configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another place to tweak parameters for your variant. Text after SAY is what will be displayed on the screen as first, usualy a name of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The tsc=unstable is useful on some (real) computers to get rid of randomly shown warnings about Time Stamp Counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x syslinux.cfg&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create sample file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To make the system a little bit more user friendly I like to have a sample file that user will be able to read and edit. You can put anything you want in it. A simple help would be also a good idea to include.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.txt &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
Hello, FLOPPINUX user!
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filesystem is ready. Final step is to put this all on a floppy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Boot Image&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we need an empty file in exact size of a floppy disk. Then format and make it bootable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create empty floppy image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dd if=/dev/zero of=floppinux.img bs=1k count=1440&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format it and create bootloader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdosfs -n FLOPPINUX floppinux.img
syslinux --install floppinux.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount it and copy syslinux, kernel, and filesystem onto it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo mount -o loop floppinux.img /mnt
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
sudo cp hello.txt /mnt/data/
sudo cp bzImage /mnt
sudo cp rootfs.cpio.xz /mnt
sudo cp syslinux.cfg /mnt
sudo umount /mnt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Done!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Test in emulator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs good to test before wasting time for the real floppy to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boot the new OS in qemu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-i386 -fda floppinux.img -m 20M -cpu 486&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it worked that means You have successfully created your own distribution! Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The floppinux.img image is ready to burn onto a floppy and boot on real hardware!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Floppy Disk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&amp;lt;!&amp;gt; Important &amp;lt;!&amp;gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change XXX to floppy drive name in your system. In my case it is sdb. Choosing wrongly will NUKE YOUR PARTITION and REMOVE all of your files! Think twice. Or use some GUI application for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo dd if=floppinux.img of=/dev/XXX bs=512 conv=notrunc,sync,fsync oflag=direct status=progress&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 5 minutes I got freshly burned floppy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed, multi-tenant key-value &amp;amp; object store written in Rust&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;minikv provides strong consistency (Raft + 2PC), durability (WAL), and production-grade observability, security, and multi-tenancy — all in a modern Rust codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built in public as a learning-by-doing project — now evolved into a complete, reference implementation of distributed systems in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;minikv v0.8.0 brings enterprise-grade features for distributed deployments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-datacenter replication: Async replication with multiple conflict resolution strategies (LWW, Vector Clocks)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change Data Capture (CDC): Real-time event streaming to Webhook, Kafka, or file sinks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Admin Web UI: Embedded dashboard for cluster monitoring and management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backup &amp;amp; Restore: Full and incremental backups with encryption support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugin system: Extensible architecture for custom storage, auth, and hooks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous highlights (v0.7.0): secondary indexes, multi-key transactions, batch import/export, durable S3 backend.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;minikv is a distributed key-value store written in Rust, designed for simplicity, speed, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who is this for ?&lt;lb/&gt; minikv is for engineers learning distributed systems, teams experimenting with Rust-based infrastructure, and anyone curious about consensus, durability, and system trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clustered : Raft consensus and 2PC for transactional writes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Virtual Sharding : 256 vshards for elastic scaling &amp;amp; balancing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WAL : Write-ahead log for durability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;gRPC for node communication, HTTP REST &amp;amp; S3 API for clients&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bloom filters, snapshots, watch/subscribe for performance &amp;amp; reactivity&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust – core logic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shell – orchestration/automation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JavaScript – benchmarks, tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Makefile – build flows&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/whispem/minikv.git

      &lt;item&gt;2PC: atomic distributed/batch writes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Virtual Shards: scale and rebalance across 256 partitions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pluggable Storage: in-memory, RocksDB, Sled&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Admin API: HTTP endpoints for status, metrics and config&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;minikv started as a 24-hour challenge by a Rust learner (82 days into the language!). It now serves as both a playground and a reference for distributed systems, demonstrating curiosity, learning-by-doing, and robust engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Stop maintaining separate config files for every AI coding tool. Define once in &lt;code&gt;.ai/&lt;/code&gt;, sync everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;One source of truth — Write your project rules, MCP servers, and permissions once&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works with your tools — Syncs to native formats each tool actually reads&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stay in sync — Update &lt;code&gt;.ai/&lt;/code&gt;and run&lt;code&gt;lnai sync&lt;/code&gt;to propagate changes instantly&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason or other, people have been posting a lot of excerpts from old emails on Twitter over the last few days. The most vital question everybody’s asking themselves is: What’s up with all those equals signs?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s something I’m somewhat of an expert on. I mean, having written mail readers and stuff; not because I’ve been to Caribbean islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen people confidently claim that it’s a code, or that it’s an artefact of scanning and then using OCR, but it’s neither — it’s just that whoever converted these emails to a readable format were morons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s that you say? “Converted?! Surely emails are just text!!” Well, if you lived in the stone age (i.e., the 80s), they mostly were, but then people invented things like “long lines” and “rock döts”, and computers had to “encode” the mail before sending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The artefact we see here is from something called “quoted printable”, or as we used to call it when it was introduced: “Quoted unreadable”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To take the first line. Whoever wrote this, typed in the following in their mail reader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;we talked about designing a pig with different non- cloven hoofs in order to make kosher bacon&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see that that’s quite a long line. Mail servers don’t like that, so mail software will break it into two lines, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;we talked about designing a pig with different non- = cloven hoofs in order to make kosher bacon&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See? There’s that equals sign! Yes, the equals sign is used to say “this should really be one single line, but I’ve broken it in two so that the mail server doesn’t get mad at me”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The formal definition here is important, though, so I have to be a bit technical here: To say “this is a continuation line”, you insert an equals sign, then a carriage return, and then a line feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;=CRLF&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three characters in total, i.e., :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- =CRLF cloven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When displaying this, we remove all these three characters, and end up&lt;lb/&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- cloven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s happened here? Well, whoever collected these emails first converted from CRLF (also known as the “Windows” line ending coding, but it’s the standard line ending in the SMTP standard) to “NL” (i.e., “Unix” line ending coding). This is pretty normal if you want to deal with email. But you then have one byte fewer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- =NL cloven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your algorithm to decode this is, stupidly, “find equals signs at the end of the line, and then delete two characters, and then finally the equals sign”, you should end up with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;... non- loven hoofs...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I.e., you lose the “c”. That’s almost what happened here, but not quite: Why does the equals sign still remain?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This StackOverflow post from 14 years ago explains the phenomenon, sort of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Obviously the client notices that = is not followed by a proper CR LF sequence, so it assumes that it is not a soft line break, but a character encoded in two hex digits, therefore it reads the next two bytes. It should notice that the next two bytes are not valid hex digits, so its behavior is wrong too, but we have to admit that at that point it does not have a chance to display something useful. They opted for the garbage in, garbage out approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, equals signs are also used for something else besides wrapping long lines, and that’s what we see later in the post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;=C2 please note&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the equals sign is not at the end of a line, it’s used to encode “funny characters”, like what you use with “rock döts”. =C2 is 194, which is a first character in a UTF-8 sequence, and the following char is most likely a =A0: =C2=A0 is “non-breakable space”, which is something people often use to indent text (and the “please note” is indented) and you see =A0 in many other places in these emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My guess is that whoever did this part just did a search-replace for =C2 and/or =A0 instead of using a proper decoder, but other explanations are certainly possible. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s what’s up with those equals signs: 1) “it’s technical”, and 2) “it’s a combination of buggy continuation line decoding and buggy non-ASCII decoding”, and 3) “whoever processed these mails are incompetent”. I don’t think 2) should be very surprising at this point, do you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Edit a bit later: To nitpick a bit here: When the standard was written, people mostly envisioned that the quoted-printable content transport encoding would be unwound upon reception (note “transport”), and that you’d end up with “clean text” on disk after reception. This didn’t really happen, so all “real” implementations do the right thing with single-character (i.e., “unencoded”) newlines. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(quoted-printable-decode-string "he=\nllo") =&amp;gt; "hello"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which leads me to assume that they reused an algo that was usually run in an SMTP server context to do the line unfolding — in that context, you can safely assume that the line ending is a CRLF. And by chance, this algo also works fine if you’re working with a Windows-based file, but fails for a Unix-based file.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;All-in-one re-entry &amp;amp; workforce development training platform&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emerge Career’s mission is to break the cycle of poverty and incarceration. We’re not just building software; we’re creating pathways to real second chances. Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, our seven-person team has already outperformed the job centers in two entire states (Vermont and South Dakota) in just the past year. With an 89% graduation rate and 92% of graduates securing training-related employment, our alumni aren’t just getting jobs—they’re launching new lives with average first-year earnings of $77,352. The results speak for themselves, and we’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776), Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat "waiting for a developer" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let "it hasn't been built yet" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start Date: ASAP&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;KDE's new Plasma Login Manager is tightly bound to systemd, making it unusable on systemd-free Linux distributions and BSD systems.&lt;lb/&gt;KDE’s upcoming Plasma Login Manager will make its first official appearance in Plasma 6.6 (scheduled for release on February 17), explicitly designed as a successor to the long-standing SDDM, which has been used by KDE Plasma for years.&lt;lb/&gt;KDE developers have framed it as deeply integrated into the Plasma stack itself, with the goal of modernizing the login process by aligning it more closely with how Plasma sessions are actually started and managed, reducing historical complexity and duplicated logic that accumulated around SDDM.&lt;lb/&gt;However, it does come with a few limitations, ones that users of systemd-free Linux distributions or BSD systems likely won’t appreciate. Here’s what it’s all about.&lt;lb/&gt;PLM is strictly systemd-native, relying on systemd-logind and systemd user services for session lifecycle management, permissions, and seat handling. These are hard dependencies, not optional features, and they form the foundation of the new login manager.&lt;lb/&gt;Because of this, systemd-free Linux distributions cannot use Plasma Login Manager, and the same applies to all BSD operating systems, which lack systemd entirely and have no compatible substitute for the APIs PLM depends on. As one of the KDE developers commented on Reddit:&lt;lb/&gt;In other words, for those users, the situation remains unchanged. On their systems, Plasma will continue to rely on SDDM or other platform-specific startup mechanisms, with no indication from KDE that PLM will be made portable beyond systemd environments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;To avoid any confusion, it’s important to emphasize that the lack of PLM support on systemd-free Linux distributions or BSD systems does not mean you can’t use the KDE Plasma desktop environment there. Plasma itself remains fully usable on those platforms.“At the end of the day, we don’t ideally want to cut support for the BSDs and other niche distros, but we also don’t want to hold back on making the best experience possible for the majority user base.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, for those users, the situation remains unchanged. On their systems, Plasma will continue to rely on SDDM or other platform-specific startup mechanisms, with no indication from KDE that PLM will be made portable beyond systemd environments.&lt;/p&gt;
