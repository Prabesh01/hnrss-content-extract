      &lt;p&gt;Inspired by Pokémon Snap (1999). VLM pilots a drone through 3D world to locate and identify creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simulation generates procedural terrain and spawns creatures (cat, dog, pig, sheep) for the drone to discover. It handles drone physics and collision detection, accepting 8 movement commands plus &lt;code&gt;identify&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;screenshot&lt;/code&gt;. The Rust controller captures frames from the simulation, constructs prompts enriched with position and state data, then parses VLM responses into executable command sequences. The objective: locate and successfully identify 3 creatures, where &lt;code&gt;identify&lt;/code&gt; succeeds when the drone is within 5 units of a target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;demo_3x.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gave 7 frontier LLMs a simple task: pilot a drone through a 3D voxel world and find 3 creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only one could do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this a rigorous benchmark? No. However, it's a reasonably fair comparison - same prompt, same seeds, same iteration limits. I'm sure with enough refinement you could coax better results out of each model. But that's kind of the point: out of the box, with zero hand-holding, only one model figured out how to actually fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core differentiator wasn't intelligence - it was altitude control. Creatures sit on the ground. To identify them, you need to descend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemini Flash: Actively adjusts altitude, descends to creature level, identifies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPT-5.2-chat: Gets close horizontally but never lowers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Opus: Attempts identification 160+ times, never succeeds - approaching at wrong angles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Others: Wander randomly or get stuck&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This left me puzzled. Claude Opus is arguably the most capable model in the lineup. It knows it needs to identify creatures. It tries - aggressively. But it never adjusts its approach angle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run 13 (seed 72) was the only run where any model found 2 creatures. Why? They happened to spawn near each other. Gemini Flash found one, turned around, and spotted the second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most other runs, Flash found one creature quickly but ran out of iterations searching for the others. The world is big. 50 iterations isn't a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the most surprising finding. I expected:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 (most expensive) to dominate&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemini 3 Pro to outperform Gemini 3 Flash (same family, more capability)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, the cheapest model beat models costing 10x more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's going on here? A few theories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spatial reasoning doesn't scale with model size - at least not yet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flash was trained differently - maybe more robotics data, more embodied scenarios?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smaller models follow instructions more literally - "go down" means go down, not "consider the optimal trajectory"&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I genuinely don't know. But if you're building an LLM-powered agent that needs to navigate physical or virtual space, the most expensive model might not be your best choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, creatures with higher contrast (gray sheep, pink pigs) seemed easier to spot than brown-ish creatures that blended into the terrain. A future version might normalize creature visibility. Or maybe that's the point - real-world object detection isn't normalized either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before this, I tried having LLMs pilot a real DJI Tello drone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results: it flew straight up, hit the ceiling, and did donuts until I caught it. (I was using Haiku 4.5, which in hindsight explains a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tello is now broken. I've ordered a BetaFPV and might get another Tello since they're so easy to program. Now that I know Gemini Flash can actually navigate, a real-world follow-up might be worth revisiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is half-serious research, half "let's see what happens."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The simulation has rough edges (it's a side project, not a polished benchmark suite)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One blanket prompt is used for all models - model-specific tuning would likely improve results&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The feedback loop is basic (position, screenshot, recent commands) - there's room to get creative with what information gets passed back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration limits (50) may artificially cap models that are slower but would eventually succeed&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are “reliable” and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research comes after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next most cited source was NDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site, Msdmanuals.com with 9,711 citations (2.08%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal, Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors, Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,” the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Television is 100 years old today. And it was born here, above an Italian cafe in Soho.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The man who first demonstrated television was John Logie Baird, a former engineering apprentice from Helensburgh. And although there are other places that can plausibly claim to be TV's birthplace, including a terraced street in Hastings, a hill in north London and Selfridges, most people agree that the decisive moment was a demonstration given to journalists in Frith Street on 26th January 1926.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baird might never have made it to London had he not been a sickly boy. When WW1 broke out he wanted to enlist but was refused due to ill health, so took a job with the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company helping to make munitions instead. In 1923 he moved to the south coast for the good of his health because it had a warmer climate, renting rooms at 21 Linton Crescent in Hastings. Here the first television signal transmitting equipment was constructed, with component parts including a hatbox, tea chest, darning needles and bicycle light lenses. The first image to be transmitted was the shadow of a St Johns Ambulance medal with a distinctive spiky outline, an item still on display at Hastings Museum. But his tinkering proved dangerous, and although a 1000-volt electric shock thankfully resulted in nothing worse than a burnt hand, his landlord duly asked him to vacate the premises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baird moved to London in November 1924 in the hope of showing off his burgeoning invention, setting up a workshop in the attic at 22 Frith Street. Amongst those who dropped by was Gordon Selfridge who invited Baird to give demonstrations of his device in the Palm Court during his store's upcoming Birthday Week celebrations. He gave three shows a day to long queues of spectators, each invited to peer down a funnel at outlines of shapes transmitted from a separate device a few yards away, including a paper mask which Baird would make 'wink' by covering the eyehole. At this stage Baird's 'Televisor' was still electro-mechanical, the images formed by spinning discs with doubled-up lenses and perforated rectangular holes. But spectators were impressed, and Baird earned a much-needed £60 to plough back into his enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By October 1925 Baird had honed his processes sufficiently to be able to transmit an image with gradations of light and shade. Initially he used a ventriloquist's dummy called Stooky Bill, this because it had greater contrast than a human face and also because it wouldn't be harmed by intense heat or possible exploding glass. Later, somewhat over-excitedly, he invited a 20 year-old office worker called William Taynton to come upstairs and become TV's first human subject. William wasn't keen but an appearance fee of half a crown persuaded him to pick through a jungle of wires, sit in front of blazing hot lamps and stick his tongue out, for just long enough that Baird exclaimed "I've seen you, William, I've seen you. I've got television at last!" When the time came for a blue plaque to be unveiled outside 22 Frith Street in 1951, it was William they invited back to do the honours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then on 26th January 1926 came the first official demonstration to members of the press. Journalists and guests from the Royal Institution were invited into Baird's workshop in small groups and first shown the dummy on screen, then each other's faces transmitted from a separate room. Only one visitor got too close to the discs and ended up with a sliced beard. Most of those present weren't especially impressed and failed to realise the significance of what they'd just seen, but The Times followed up with a short article two days later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Members of the Royal Institution and other visitors to a laboratory in an upper room in Frith-Street, Soho, on Tuesday saw a demonstration of apparatus invented by Mr. J.L. Baird, who claims to have solved the problem of television. They were shown a transmitting machine, consisting of a large wooden revolving disc containing lenses, behind which was a revolving shutter and a light sensitive cell. It was explained that by means of the shutter and lens disc an image of articles or persons standing in front of the machine could be made to pass over the light sensitive cell at high speed. The current in the cell varies in proportion to the light falling on it, and this varying current is transmitted to a receiver where it controls a light behind an optical arrangement similar to that at the sending end. By this means a point of light is caused to traverse a ground glass screen. The light is dim at the shadows and bright at the high lights, and crosses the screen so rapidly that the whole image appears simultaneously to the eye. (The Times, 28th January 1926)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days 22 Frith Street is home to retro cafe Bar Italia. It's been owned and run by the Polledri family since 1949, a coffee-squirting dynasty who also run the Little Italy restaurant nextdoor. The stone floor was laid by their uncle Torino, a terrazzo mosaic specialist, and the counter was one of the first in London to be graced by an original Gaggia machine. Once a magnet for mods on scooters Bar Italia has attracted many famous names over the years, notably Rocky Marciano whose huge poster has pride of place behind the counter. You could thus celebrate today's centenary with an espresso and a slice of pizza in the photo-bedecked interior, or risk sitting outside below the neon sign with a froth and cheesecake combo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number 22 also displays a Milestone plaque erected by The Institution of Electrical Engineers citing "the world's first public demonstration of live television". Below is a much newer plaque citing this as an accredited World Origin Site. I first saw one of these inside the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum earlier in the month, earned for the discovery of penicillin, but whereas that was designated WOS 0001 the invention of television only ranks 0037. I believe they're unveiling it officially at 2pm this afternoon, even though it was perfectly visible over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baird was a highly driven inventor and entrepreneur and went on to develop prototypes for all sorts of forward-looking formats. In 1927 he came up with ‘Phonovision’ (image recordings onto 78 rpm gramophone records) and ‘Noctovision’ (infra-red TV). In 1928, amazingly, he demonstrated both colour television and stereoscopic (3D) television. His ultimate aim was television broadcasting via the BBC, beginning experimental transmissions of 30-line television in 1930 and delivering the first outside broadcast (from the Derby) in 1931, not that anyone was yet watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in 1932 EMI started to provide serious competition, developing their own pioneering electronic television camera called the Emitron. The government's Television Advisory Committee ultimately recommended that both Baird's 240-line mechanical system and Marconi-EMI's 405-line electronic system be developed as alternatives for the proposed new London television station. And so it was that when broadcast TV first launched at Alexandra Palace on 2nd November 1936 the two systems alternated one week each... Baird second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It rapidly became clear that the Marconi system was far superior and Baird's was dropped after just three months. Baird also suffered when his studios were burned in the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace, and his company went into receivership when all TV broadcasting was suspended at the start of WW2. He carried on inventing at home in Sydenham, vastly improving his system for colour television, until his laboratory was made unusable by bomb damage. Alas ill health caught up with him and he died after a stroke at the age of 57, just one week after the BBC restarted television broadcasts in 1946. You can't see his final home in Bexhill because it was replaced by a block of flats in 2005, but Baird does have an impressive number of plaques across central London and SE26.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not always easy being first, and after early televisual success John Logie Baird saw his star wane and fade. But it's still him we remember for making possible one of the key transformative inventions of the 20th century, even though barely anyone watched his first efforts. It took ten years to get from Stooky Bill to BBC TV's opening night, then another two decades before the widespread adoption of TV sets in British households and two more until colour television took hold. But 100 years on almost all of us have a TV set at home and effectively another in our pocket, and all because a Scotsman came to London and cleverly spun some discs.&lt;/p&gt;

to inherit the configuration from models.dev&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🌐 Expanded Provider Support&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The switch to models.dev greatly expands the model selection to over 530 models from 24 different providers, including new support for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Provider&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Models&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Provider&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Models&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Alibaba&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;39&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Chutes&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;56&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Zai Coding Plan&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;MiniMax&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Fireworks AI&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Moonshot AI&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;27&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Nvidia&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;24&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;GitHub Models&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;55&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Zai&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Cerebras&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;LMStudio&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;local&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Ollama&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;local&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non OpenAI Compatible LLM and Image generation providers are maintained in the providers extension, registered using the &lt;code&gt;ctx.add_provider()&lt;/code&gt; API. There are several different provider implementations to take advantage of features available in each provider, such as Interleaved Thinking support in Anthropic's Messages API which enables all Claude and MiniMax models to reason between tool calls for improved agentic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🔄 Automatic Provider Updates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actively maintained list of available providers and models are automatically updated into your &lt;code&gt;providers.json&lt;/code&gt; daily that can also be manually updated with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an optimization only the providers that are referenced in your &lt;code&gt;llms.json&lt;/code&gt; are saved. Any additional providers you want to use that are not included in models.dev can be added to your &lt;code&gt;~/.llms/providers-extra.json&lt;/code&gt;, which get merged into your &lt;code&gt;providers.json&lt;/code&gt; on every update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This keeps your local configuration file lightweight by only including the providers that are available for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Configuration Examples&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable providers by ID — all configuration is automatically inherited:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Configuration docs for more info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New Model Selector UI&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 530 models from 24 providers now available, discovering and selecting the right model required a complete overhaul. The Model Selector has been completely redesigned as a full-featured dialog offering:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;🔍 Smart Search &amp;amp; Discovery - Instantly search across model names, IDs, and providers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🎯 Advanced Filtering - Filter by name, providers &amp;amp; input and output modalities&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;📊 Flexible Sorting - Sort by Knowledge Cutoff, Release Date, Last Updated &amp;amp; Context&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;⭐ Favorites System - Star model card to add/remove to favorites quick list&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;💎 Rich Model Cards - In depth model overview at a glance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where providers can be quickly enabled or disabled to customize which models are available:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Model Selector docs for more info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rewritten for Extensibility&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;llms.py has been rewritten from the ground-up with extensibility a core concept where all major UI and Server features now layer on their encapsulated functionality by using the public Client &amp;amp; Server Extensibility APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensions are just folders that can add both Server and UI features using the public client and server extensibility APIs. Built-in features are just extensions in the repo's llms/extensions folder which can be disabled or overridden by adding them to your local &lt;code&gt;~/.llms/extensions&lt;/code&gt; folder. Too minimize bloat, only features that are generally useful and don't require additional dependencies are included as built-in extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;llms includes support for installing and uninstalling extensions from any GitHub repository. For better discoverability, non built-in extensions are maintained in the github.com/llmspy organization repositories which anyone else is welcome to contribute their repos to for increased discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UI components are now registered and referenced as Global Vue components, which can be easily replaced by registering Vue components with the same name as done in the xmas extension demo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allows main.py to retain a lean functional core in a single file whilst still being fully extensible and lays the foundation for rapid development of new features - both from the core team and external 3rd party extensions - enabling the community to extend llms.py in new unanticipated ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For deployments requiring minimal footprint, the Custom Build docs shows how to create a tailored distribution with only the specific extensions you need - perfect for CLI-only or lightweight API server deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extensions System&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep the core lightweight while enabling limitless enhancements, we've implemented a flexible Extensions system inspired by ComfyUI Custom Nodes. This allows adding new features, pages and toolbar icons, register new provider implementations, extend, replace, and customize the UI with your own custom features, just by adding new extension folders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Managing Extensions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;List available extensions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install an extension:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install a 3rd-party extension:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.llms/extensions/my_extension&lt;/code&gt; and installs any &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; dependencies.&lt;p&gt;List installed extensions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove an extension:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Manual Installation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensions can be installed from GitHub or by creating a local folder:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Local: Simply create a folder in &lt;code&gt;~/.llms/extensions/my_extension&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;GitHub: Clone extensions into &lt;code&gt;~/.llms/extensions&lt;/code&gt;, e.g:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Extensions docs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How it Works (Server)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensions are Python modules that plug into the server lifecycle using special hooks defined in their &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Hook&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Purpose&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;__parser__(parser)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Add custom CLI arguments&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;__install__(ctx)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Enhance the server instance (routes, providers, filters, etc.)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;__load__(ctx)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Load data or perform async tasks before server starts&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;__run__(ctx)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Execute custom logic when running in CLI mode&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ctx&lt;/code&gt; parameter provides access to the &lt;code&gt;ExtensionContext&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Server Extensions docs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How it Works (UI)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensions can also include frontend components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Placement: Add a &lt;code&gt;ui&lt;/code&gt;folder within your extension directory&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Access: Files in this folder are automatically served at &lt;code&gt;/ext/&amp;lt;extension_name&amp;gt;/*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Integration: Create a &lt;code&gt;ui/index.mjs&lt;/code&gt;file. This is the entry point and must export an&lt;code&gt;install&lt;/code&gt;function:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;See UI Extensions docs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example: xmas extension&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The xmas extension demonstrates these capabilities where it utilizes the Extensions APIs to give llms.py a splash of Christmas spirit. It uses &lt;code&gt;__install__&lt;/code&gt; to register an API endpoint and a UI extension for its UI features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Replacing Core Components&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All UI features of xmas is implemented in its ui/index.mjs which overrides default &lt;code&gt;Brand&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Welcome&lt;/code&gt; components by registering components with the same name, e.g:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To change both the home page and brand on the top-left to give every page title a festive touch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also demonstrates adding a new icon on the left sidebar to open its custom Xmas page component and a top-panel component to display its "Ask Santa" portal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;xmas page&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ask Santa panel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xmas page calls a custom API endpoint registered in its &lt;code&gt;__install__&lt;/code&gt; hook to return a custom festive greeting, whilst the top-panel modifies chat requests while its Top Panel is open to add a Santa system prompt which is enough to implement its "Ask Santa" feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart generation models like Nano Banana's gemini-2.5-flash-image perform exceptionally well here as they're able to answer your kids questions with rich, detailed responses and image outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gemini RAG Extension&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gemini extension provides a complete solution for managing Google Gemini's File Search Stores, enabling RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) workflows with automatic document uploads, category organization, and bidirectional sync between your local database and Gemini's cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build up your own knowledge base in File Stores, optionally organized into categories, that you can query to ground your AI chats with your own data - whether that's searching across a single document, a category of related documents, or your entire filestore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Install&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install the gemini extension via the CLI:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After which you'll be able to click the Gemini Icon to open the Gemini extension page from the sidebar to manage your filestores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Key Features&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Filestore Management: Create and manage isolated stores of documents for different projects or knowledge bases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Drag &amp;amp; Drop Uploads: Easily upload documents (PDF, Text, Markdown, etc.) by dragging them into the UI&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Smart Categorization: Organize documents into categories (folders) for granular retrieval&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Contextual RAG Chat: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ask Filestore: Chat with the entire knowledge base of a filestore&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ask Category: Focus your chat on a specific category within a filestore&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ask Document: Chat with a single specific document&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bi-Directional Sync: Reconcile your local database with the remote Gemini File API&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Uploading Documents&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents can be uploaded by dragging and dropping files onto the upload zone or clicking to open the file picker. You can organize uploads into category folders by typing a category name before uploading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uploads are processed asynchronously by a Background Worker utilizing a DB Queue, so you can continue working while documents are indexed. The worker automatically starts when new documents are uploaded and efficiently handles batch processing without blocking the UI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;RAG Chat in Action&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once documents are uploaded, you can start contextual RAG chat sessions with your data. Each session is pre-configured with a Gemini Model and the &lt;code&gt;file_search&lt;/code&gt; tool to query your selected filestore, category, or document - as shown in the meta example below querying this very v3 document for its best features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grounded sources used to answer your query are displayed at the bottom of each chat response, allowing you to verify and explore the source documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the Gemini Extension docs for complete usage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tool Support&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release also includes first-class support for Python function calling (Tools), allowing LLMs to interact with your local environment and custom functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools can be defined using standard Python functions where its tool definition can be implicitly defined from its function's signature, type hints, and docstrings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Register tools for function calling&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Implicit Tool Definition&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tools can be registered within an extension's &lt;code&gt;install&lt;/code&gt; hook using &lt;code&gt;ctx.register_tool&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If no group is specified, tools are registered under the default &lt;code&gt;custom&lt;/code&gt; group, alternatively you can group them under your preferred name:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Explicit Tool Definition&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When more fine-grain configuration is needed you can use an explicit tool definition, e.g:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;UI Management&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;One-Click Enable/Disable: Use the Tool Selector in the top-right to control which tools to use per request&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Granular Control: Select "All", "None", or specific tools for each chat session&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated Tools Page: View all registered tools and their definitions at &lt;code&gt;/tools&lt;/code&gt; or via the sidebar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MCP Support&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fast_mcp extension brings Model Context Protocol (MCP) support to llms.py, allowing you to extend LLM capabilities with a wide range of external tools and services using the FastMCP Python Framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Install&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Key Features&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Standardized Tool Access: Connect to any MCP-compliant server (Node.js, Python, etc.) seamlessly&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Dynamic Discovery: Automatically discovers and registers all tools exposed by configured servers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Parallel Discovery: All configured MCP servers are discovered concurrently for fast startup times&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;UI Management: Add, edit, and manage MCP servers directly from the Tools page&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MCP Servers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gemini Image via MCP&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Configuration&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCP servers are configured via a &lt;code&gt;mcp.json&lt;/code&gt; file.

Based on Anthropic's computer use tools, it enables agents to see your screen, control the mouse and keyboard, execute shell commands, and edit files - just like a human sitting at the computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unlocks powerful capabilities that traditional API-based tools cannot achieve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Visual Verification: Confirm that code actually renders correctly in a browser&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Desktop Automation: Control any GUI application - web browsers, IDEs, terminals&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;End-to-End Workflows: Chain together multiple applications in a single task&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Legacy Applications: Automate software that lacks APIs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, an agent can write a web application, open a browser, and capture a screenshot to prove it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the Computer Use docs for complete usage details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calculator UI&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As some core tools are particularly useful on their own, dedicated UIs has been added for the &lt;code&gt;calc&lt;/code&gt; tool with support for evaluating mathematical python expressions, including arithmetic, comparison, boolean operators, &lt;code&gt;math.*&lt;/code&gt; functions &amp;amp; constants and python list comprehensions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;🖥️ UX Friendly Interface - Clean, modern, responsive UI with dark mode support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;💾 Persistent History - Calculations automatically saved to localStorage and preserved between sessions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;⚡ 1-Click Interaction - Click history items to instantly load expressions and copy to clipboard&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;⌨️ Keyboard-Free Access - Complete UI buttons for numbers, operators, constants, and math functions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🐍 Python Math Support - Full access to Python's math library including trig, stats, and more&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;🛡️ Safe Evaluation - AST-based evaluator prevents arbitrary code execution for secure calculations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Run Code UI&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst the &lt;code&gt;run_python&lt;/code&gt; tools provides a scratch pad for running stand-alone Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# code in a sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI uses CodeMirror as the code editor, providing a better user experience with syntax highlighting, code completion, and other IDE-like features for writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Run Python, JavaScript, TypeScript &amp;amp; C# programs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run Python&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run JavaScript&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run TypeScript&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run C#&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to view full size&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI uses CodeMirror as the code editor, providing a better user experience with syntax highlighting, code completion, and other IDE-like features for writing code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the Run Code UI docs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;KaTeX Math Typesetting&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The katex extension enables beautiful rendering of LaTeX math expressions in AI responses using KaTeX.

This architectural shift ensures better data consistency, improved performance that enables parallel executions and multi-device access to your chat history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep the database efficient and portable, binary assets (images, audio, etc.) are not stored directly in the SQLite database, Instead all generated assets are stored in the local file system cache at &lt;code&gt;~/.llms/cache&lt;/code&gt; and only relative URLs referencing these assets are stored in the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Concurrency Model&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure data integrity and high performance without complex locking mechanisms, the system utilizes a single background thread to write operations to the database. This design improves concurrency handling and eliminates database locking issues during high-load scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Multi-Tenancy &amp;amp; Security&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When authentication is enabled, data isolation is automatically enforced. All core tables, including &lt;code&gt;threads&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt;, are scoped to the authenticated user, ensuring that users can only access their own data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Image Cache &amp;amp; Optimization&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new caching system has been implemented for generated assets and uploaded images and files that's now persisted in &lt;code&gt;~/.llms/cache&lt;/code&gt;, preserving them across messages and sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Efficient Storage: Only cache references are stored with chat messages&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Persistent Access: Images remain accessible in previews and downloads after page reloads&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Automatic Management: System handles file storage and serving transparently&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that all persistence is server-side, to transfer or backup your configurations, extensions and Chat History you need only copy your &lt;code&gt;~/.llms&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CLI - more Powerful than Ever&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All server extension features including tools, custom providers, database persistence, and image/audio generation are fully accessible via the command line, making llms.py a powerful terminal-based AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core CLI Usage&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tools &amp;amp; Function Calling&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All registered tools are automatically available in CLI mode.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're in the hard seltzer era of AI code review: everybody's doing them. OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Augment, now Cognition, and even Linear. Of course, there's also the "White Claws" of code review: pure-play code review agents like Greptile (that's us!), CodeRabbit, Macroscope, and a litter of fledgling YC startups. Then there are the adjacent Budweisers of this world:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazingly, these two were announced practically within 24 hours of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the proprietors of an, er, AI code review tool suddenly beset by an avalanche of competition, we're asking ourselves: what makes us different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does one differentiate?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our benchmarks, we are uniquely good at catching bugs. However, if all company blogs are to be trusted, this is something we have in common with every other AI code review product. One just has to try a few, and pick the one that feels the best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, code review performance is ephemeral and subjective, and is ultimately not an interesting way to discern the agents before trying them. It's useless for me to try to convince you that we're the best. You should just try us and make up your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of telling you how our product is differentiated, I am going to tell you how our viewpoint is differentiated - how we think code review will look in the long-term, and what we're doing today to prepare our customers for that future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our thesis can be distilled into three pillars: independence, autonomy, and feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Independence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We strongly believe that the review agent should be different from the coding agent. We are opinionated on the importance of independent code validation agents. In spite of multiple requests, we have never shipped codegen features. We don't write code; an auditor doesn't prepare the books, a fox doesn't guard the henhouse, and a student doesn't grade their own essays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today's agents are better than the median human code reviewer at catching issues and enforcing standards, and they're only getting better. It's clear that in the future a large percentage of code at companies will be auto-approved by the code review agent. In other words, there will be some instances where a human writes a ticket, an agent writes the PR, and another agent validates, approves, and merges it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might seem far-fetched but the counterfactual is Kafkaesque. A human rubber-stamping code being validated by a super intelligent machine is the equivalent of a human sitting silently in the driver's seat of a self-driving car, "supervising".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If agents are approving code, it would be quite absurd and perhaps non-compliant to have the agent that wrote the code also approve the code. Only once would you have X write a PR, then have X approve and merge it to realize the absurdity of what you just did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Autonomy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something that Greptiles generally agree on is that everything that can be automated, will be automated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code validation - which to us is the combination of review, test, and QA, is an excellent candidate for full automation. It's work that humans don't want to do, and aren't particularly good at. It also requires little in the way of creative expression, unlike programming. In addition, success is generally pretty well-defined. Everyone wants correct, performant, bug-free, secure code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some other products have built out great UIs for humans to review code in an AI-assisted paradigm, we have chosen to build for what we consider to be an inevitable future - one where code validation requires vanishingly little human participation. We have no code review UI, and view ourselves as more of a background automation or "pipes" product. Human engineers should be focused only on two things - coming up with brilliant ideas for what should exist, and expressing their vision and taste to agents that do the cruft of turning it all into clean, performant code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not long ago, we released our Claude Code plugin. It can do many things - but most notably, you can ask Claude Code to pull down and address Greptile's comments from the PR. You can ask it to keep going until there are no new comments, waiting a few minutes for a review after each push.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a step towards the future we're excited about: Human expresses intent, coding agent executes, validation/review agent finds issues and hands them back - kicking off a loop until it approves and merges. If there is ambiguity at any point, the agents Slack the human to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question of how these things are different is important. Unlike picking IDEs and coding agents that ostensibly have low switching costs, code review products are harder to rip out, so your decision will very likely turn out to be a long-term one, especially if you're a large company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've been around for about as long as AI code review has been around. It has gone from a fringe interest of the world's most adventurous vibecoders to a mainstream product that our enterprise users (including two of the Mag7) often describe as a "no-brainer" purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, our guess on where this goes is about as good as anyone else's. Meanwhile, we'll keep doing what we've always done - trying to make things our users love.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What "The Best" Looks Like&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;—Arthur Schopenhauer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second that the next round of funding hits the bank, every new CTO starts obsessing over the same thing: Who the hell do I hire next? The answer is surprisingly non-obvious. You’re told that you always want—scratch that, need—the best of the best, your startup’s future depends on it. You’re told your company is unique, special, and it requires the most hardcore among researchers, designers, engineers, and product managers. You never skimp on who builds the golden goose. You can’t succeed with any less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, is that actually true?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every startup-hustle YouTube video, VC podcast and celeb founder interview regurgitates that the key to success is to hire the very best people, no matter what it takes. And yet you live in the real world, with real-world constraints. You have only so much money in the bank. Only so much time and bandwidth to hire. Only so much attention in a given day. And you’re not alone in your hunt. You’re competing with hundreds of other players in your geography, industry, and problem space looking for “the best.” Many of them have a more famous brand, more cash, more promising equity, more charming founders, and maybe even a high production value promo video showcasing happy employees, rare wood office counters and a shoes-off policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will you actually hire the best of the best against those odds? Many years ago I found myself in this pickle and I had to learn all the relevant lessons the hard way. I share these lessons here, so that you don’t have to struggle through that same maze yourself. My pain is your gain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first time around the startup world in 2012, I hardly knew what I was doing and relied mostly on luck—and unfortunately, firing—to end up with a team I could be proud of. I had no real point of reference for greatness, for what “the best” in our area could look like, and building that model required lots of experimentation, with high highs and many low lows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of David, our brilliant infrastructure ops engineer at Freckle, has stayed with me ever since. David applied to the company back when we were only hiring for an ops role. We were growing slowly, so there was zero room for anybody who wasn’t absolutely essential on the team. We had no open-ended extra seat for a smart person who just happened to be on the market, unlike some companies these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David was 100% what we were not looking for. He had never done any ops. In fact, he had never done anything related to web dev or product engineering. I’m not sure he even knew what AWS was at that point. He was a sharp physics guy working with a professor on simulations in an academic context. He didn’t let that deter him. He wanted to work at Freckle, thanks to our reputation as one of the few software startups in the world using Haskell in production at scale. We were an odd outlier in a sea of buggy and laborious Rails apps, a shelter for people who didn’t want yet another web slop gig. And Haskell was oh-so-hot in the Hacker News programming language theory space at the time, a technology attracting software nerds obsessed with correctness and new, better ways of developing bug-free apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I immediately told David that he was not a fit; he had none of what we were looking for. And yet he persisted, emailing me that he would do whatever test project we threw at him, and if he bombed it, no problem, he would go away. But if he nailed it, we would have proof that he was qualified, in spite of what his CV indicated. Fine. I sent him a meaty cloud ops take-home project, expecting to never hear from him again. Importantly, this was in the days before you could have Claude Code slap that together for you in two prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A day or two later, he returned the project to us, and it was pretty much flawless, doing even more than we had asked for. That was not expected. I got curious about what else he could do. We weren’t drowning in applicants anyway, so I figured I didn’t have much to lose. We took him through the usual interview process. He was humble, optimistic, well-spoken, actively communicating and taking feedback well, eager to get to work. He was pumped about everything he could learn on the job, about the doors that would eventually open if he nailed it. He didn’t have much experience, as someone who had never written commercial software before, but he was really quick to absorb everything we threw at him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We gave him a chance. As predicted, he was stellar, and we had a really good run with him until he moved on to a much more illustrious employer. A few years later he became a senior principal engineer at Stripe, going from a physics lab, then a starry-eyed K-12 software startup, to being a big deal at one of Silicon Valley’s finest firms. An unsurprising path for one of “the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While building the different companies I worked at, I’ve run several times into “Davids” who ended up with meteoric career trajectories, sometimes already pedigreed in all the right ways, sometimes completely invisible to everyone but the trained eye of a CTO looking for gold. What is special about someone like that? And how can you, with your humble hiring budget, identify them before their value is obvious to everybody else in the market?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With David, it was obvious that I had lucked my way into finding him. He had to badger me into seeing what he was capable of, at a time when I was only looking for obvious signs of success. Later on at my game studio, thanks to a brutally skewed job market, I had the total pick of the litter during Hiring Summer and could select one or two stellar engineers from hundreds of perfectly reasonable applicants. There was hardly any competition, with money drying up all around the industry. Again, I found a diamond in the rough. But this time I had the right knowledge and strategies in place to end up with the kind of team I wanted with far less reliance on luck. Even as I was drowning in hundreds of resumes that all started to look the same, “the best” candidate was still in there, like a needle in a haystack. This time, I felt like I was actually skilled enough to find that hidden gem, not simply crossing my fingers and relying on luck alone. That’s a feeling of empowerment I would like you to experience as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What do we mean by “the best”?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, when every company says they have the best people, the math doesn’t work out. And of course, if they regularly have to fire staff, something doesn’t add up again. One day you end up landing a job at one of these companies and realize that the braggadocio was hardly reflective of reality, but then again, it’s all part of the startup founder LARP that requires you play the part. “Our team is okay, you will probably like working here, we sometimes know what we’re doing” would be a much more accurate depiction, but you’ll never find that quote on the careers page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, you want to be a good Boy Scout CTO and live up to the lofty expectations set for you by the Silicon Valley elders, and at least try to hire “the best of the best” as they say in all of the fireside chats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then, a question naturally emerges: what exactly do we mean by the best? The accolades? Pedigrees? Github stars? Hacker News front pages? Job title? Celebrity employers? Number of former YCombinator companies worked at? Hackathon wins? Typing speed? Clout among other Rust developers wearing fuzzy animal costumes? That all sounds good, I guess, but is that all relevant to your company?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that “the best” is mostly subjective and specific to your situation. The culture, the vibe, the industry, the processes of your company, and the technical choices will all influence who will be a phenomenal addition to your tribe. That person might not be the same individual bringing in a million or two a year at Meta. In fact, that highly pedigreed, highly connected individual might be a net negative for your company, even though they might, at least on paper, seem the most high-end among candidates. They may blow the mind of a recruiter at Netflix, but they may not want to schlep through all of the messiness and chaos of an early stage company still trying to define itself. They’re not the best for you, and they’re likely not the best for startups, but plenty of other people are. Your job is to determine what those traits are and where to find people who have them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Universally Best Startup Hires&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your company, timing, industry, problem space and founding team personalities are unique, which is why a generic blog post or a book could never tell you exactly what hires are optimal for you. However, experience shows that there are many universal winning commonalities between great hires that will be applicable regardless of your early stage company’s unique DNA. I identify 11 of them below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 11 traits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-obviousness&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not-too-junior&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not-too-senior&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hunger&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Humility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High EQ&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team-centricity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Competence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High-agency problem-solvers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-disciplinary empathy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tolerance of uncertainty&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side note, I found Patrick Lencioni’s framework from The Ideal Team Player to survive first contact with both pre-seed and Series A+ realities. It’s one of those dry-as-dust HBR book club management self-help guides that get an eyeroll by your median 20-year-old founder going through YCombinator, but in my experience it confirmed and put a simple model around something I had personally seen emerge again and again in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lencioni identifies three essential traits: hunger, humility and smarts, the latter of which should have been called EQ all along. You’ll see them referenced below. The three criteria may seem obvious at a glance, but having a simple framework to work with as you’re making hundreds of decisions makes a big difference. Simple things done right turn out to be pretty darn powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at the 11 commonalities among great startup hires I’ve identified. Some of them are simply statistically likely to occur due to the nature of startup hiring. Others are ones you should straight up filter for when you’re doing your search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Non-obviousness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best hires in the early stages are usually non-obviously good to the untrained eye. They don’t look as appealing to employers with infinite resources who otherwise would have already hired them. If they were obviously incredible, it would be unlikely you—at your startup—would ever talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most important skills of a startup CTO trying to hire an amazing team is the ability to uncover awesome talent that others have overlooked. These candidates get skipped often due to being too off-the-beaten-path and under-pedigreed compared to the obvious picks that every other company is making. Often these candidates are bad at marketing themselves, don’t know where to look, and are off-putting in some way to the naive search. You have an opportunity to take advantage of that oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realistically, someone who looks like the perfect FAANG candidate who has won all of the math olympiads, had all of the stellar internships, and went to the top CS schools will either:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a. get a big cash dump from YC and start their own thing, or&lt;lb/&gt; b. go work at one of the career-building brand names in the Valley and make a monstrous amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The karmic wheel is just about cycling between those two until that person either gets into VC or becomes an exec at a prestigious firm years later. If that’s what the universe has in store for a candidate, taking a chance on a no-name team with 12 months in the bank, poor development practices and sloppy management is a tough proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That leaves a pretty large pool of “everybody else” who didn’t pattern-match. How you go about sifting through them is a big topic I will leave for another chapter, but the key is to look for signals that are less obvious than a Stanford degree and an OpenAI internship. Often that looks like a large volume of work, expertise in unsexy niche areas of technology, an intense work ethic driven by curiosity, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Stanford CS degree is no guarantee someone will be a phenomenal contributor at your company, but it’s a reasonable proxy of future potential for large employers with long time horizons that allow them to invest in coaching and nurturing their junior staff. That’s not in the cards for a pre-revenue startup that will run out of money next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Not-too-junior&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best people for your startup will most likely be senior, or at least mid-stage contributors with several solid years of experience. Too senior isn’t great either, you don’t need the large scale cross-team mature product jousting chops. There’s likely no staff-level work for them to do, and staff-level engineers aren’t just faster-typing seniors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an early stage startup, until you have enough lead developers, senior product managers, senior designers etc. to set the standard, hiring fresh-out-of-school contributors is a gamble. Junior staff are still developing their taste, judgment, ability to work in a team, and understanding of how to follow the process and when to deviate from it. Without an adult in the room you’re in cat-herding territory. This isn’t to say that you won’t get work done this way, but you could have had someone else in that seat who required less supervision. And you’re at a stage where every seat is mission-critical and the opportunity cost is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it might not matter too much as you throw prototype spaghetti at the wall in the early days, as soon as you have something worth maintaining and complexity rises, you’re now in a race against time. Someone must actively garden the complexity of the work and be ultimately responsible for it, and that someone will tend to be not fresh-out-of-school. Sure, a green dev can care about complexity. But most haven’t yet lived through a soul-crushing, multi-week refactor fueled by years of tech debt, the kind of preventable trauma that earns you “character-building scars.” If they’re learning those lessons on your watch, they’re doing it at the expense of your delivery timeline and your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m fond of mid-stage software developers who demonstrate terrific chops, hunger to learn and prove themselves. Yes, they require more hand-holding, but usually the volume of work they put out, and their openness to re-do it, if needed, is worth betting on. You should be able to manage a couple of them yourself as the CTO in the early days, and soon enough you’ll have other senior people on the team who will pick up the mentorship torch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Not-too-senior&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also means that the “best people” to hire at this stage will tend to be earlier in their careers. The longer great people are on the market, the more likely they are to be identified by the market as being great. Your job as a startup CTO is to find them before others do. Once the market has found them and has actively started rewarding them, they will be out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, it’s worth mentioning that in specific well-capitalized niches of the startup market, companies are now able to pay a decent chunk of change thanks to larger VC rounds and quicker time-to-revenue. Thus, the old school notion that BigCo always pays best may not hold true as often. Here’s a quick sample of many Work at a Startup roles in December 2025. Not quite at FAANG-level, but far from starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Category&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Count&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Median&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Min (Midpoint)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Max (Midpoint)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Regular SWE&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;45&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$157.4K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$150.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$85.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$275.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Senior SWE&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$209.8K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$202.5K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$140.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$350.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Founding SWE&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;33&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$189.3K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$185.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$125.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$255.0K&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That also means that, unless your company grows fast or shows tremendous potential for the yet-unvested equity, you won’t get a ton of time with your great early career hires. They will quickly accumulate valuable experience and prove themselves to be stellar, and move on to a prestigious employer with longer time horizons, a great brand name, and a stupendous paycheck that you will not be able to match. Being an L5-7 at BigCo pays a pretty penny, with none of the unpredictability of startup equity and saner hours, but none of the adventure and camaraderie of a pirate ship. For employees later in their careers, that’s not a bad tradeoff. Once they have vested with your company, it makes sense for them to diversify their equities, as they already own one lottery ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being on the receiving end of a reference call for one of your star employees, while they’re still working at your company, is always bittersweet: on one hand you want what’s best for them, to level up and grow in their career. On the other, they’re your discovery—dang it—and you know you won’t be able to counter-offer the type of employer they can now attract. Or they decide to start their own company, emboldened and informed by the experience at yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, that’s okay. Sometimes a great hire’s growth trajectory is faster than a startup’s, and you can be grateful for having given them a chance to prove themselves and to find a new path that they wouldn’t have otherwise. That kind of hire will have likely made a major difference to your company and having trusted alumni out there in the world doing great things should be a source of pride and good industry karma for any CTO who discovered them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seniority here also unfortunately often correlates with age. The best startup employee will usually be someone early in their career who doesn’t have as many responsibilities or as much need for consistency due to having more dependents. They may have fewer immediate cash flow constraints, fewer “adult responsibilities.” Kids need braces and karate classes, and if Mom is doing 996 at a ten-person company paying her peanuts, offering a crappy health care plan, promising an epic payout ten years from now, that’s a real mismatch. Startups are an extreme sport, and generally inadvisable for anybody who’s not in a safe position to speculate on their career for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hunger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best hires are self-driven, stoked by the ability to learn, to gain mastery of the craft, and by being able to show off their accomplishments to the rest of the team they want to impress. When you look at their track record, even when it’s not filled with household-name accolades and pedigrees, you will typically see breadcrumbs of exploration, toy projects and experimentation fueled by curiosity. It’s that classic desire to hack things and understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need to ask them to work a little harder, they know this is a big growth spurt for them and they want to take advantage of it. The company is giving them a valuable practice canvas for their skills and they want to make the most of this opportunity, which unfortunately isn’t that common. They love a challenge, they want to prove themselves, they love the work and they are excited by being around others who will push them to be their best. They would have been hacking on something interesting either way, but now you’re actually paying them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re curious about how everything works: your company, the startup world, the industry they’re diving into, other disciplines, the tech they’re using. They’re learning, absorbing. Maybe they want to start their own thing one day, or maybe they’re set on using this gig as a ramp to something else they dream about. Maybe they just want the new optionality granted by having your company on their resume. They’re sponges and will gladly take on the challenges you send their way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember throwing a big Redux experiment at David in what must have been his first month at work. Again, no web dev experience prior to this. Nobody on the team knew the technology and he, hired as an infrastructure engineer with a background in physics and zero product engineering experience, had something up and running for us within days. He was pumped he got to do something so radically new for the team as one of his first assignments. Ultimately we decided the tech wasn’t a fit for our existing codebase, we scrapped the experiment, and he ran off to the next challenge with no loss of enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Double Dusk we could not figure out why players would regularly de-sync their character positions on the server when using a custom—and wildly complicated, due to needing to replicate Half Life 2-style movement to the smallest detail inside of Unreal Engine—character movement component in combination with our own Unreal Engine networking tweaks, making character movement authoritative on client instances of the game. A big deviation from the defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our newly-hired star engineer, us being his first ever employer, had to dive into the pit of madness. He almost gave up several times before finally identifying all of the spots in the physics sub-stepping logic that was causing the drift across the network. I’m confident I myself would have gone completely bananas trying to debug that one. He was proud of the trust we had put in him, he was eager to learn, he didn’t want to let the team down, and I knew enough about him to make the bet that the challenge would have been just barely within his abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hunger is a massive force-multiplier, and unlike many other traits, it doesn’t seem to be teachable. Failures will instill humility. Rejection will hone your EQ. But you’re either driven to compete, learn and prove yourself, or you’re not. No manager’s pep talk will kickstart that drive in you, at least not sustainably. The hubris has to come from somewhere much deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Humility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Startups are all about rapid experimentation, trying countless ideas that don’t work, and bootstrapping the skills and processes of the company as it figures out just what exactly people will pay for. Trust-building is critical in any team endeavor, and members who are unable to admit fault, who take up all of the space, and/or who need to be right at all costs will be a real problem as the company matures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best hires are humble and will happily talk about both their victories and their biggest implosions, about what they learned from their misadventures, about talented past coworkers and how their efforts were part of a team. They rarely claim to have single-handedly carried everything on their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you interview candidates searching for the best, many non-obvious great hires will be bad at behavioral interviews—or interviews in general, for that matter. They didn’t get extensive training on answering questions using the STAR method, didn’t drill stock responses to predictable and tired interview questions. They’re early-ish stage hands-on technology people, not smooth-talking execs jumping from one boardroom to the next. It is your job to fish for key nuggets of insight buried in the rough presentation. After you interview enough people with a similar set of standard questions, you’ll be able to spot the outliers in the bell curve of responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An underrated aspect of humility in startups is detachment from one’s work. Companies in the process of inventing themselves need to actively cycle through many ideas, most of which will ultimately not stand the test of time. Design for the trash can and kill your darlings are important mindsets in creative work, and they extend far beyond music, film and games. Quantity leads to quality, and a great hire will accept regularly needing to apply a flamethrower to their work and try again with the new learnings from the latest experiment. They will not be precious about it, nor will they feel diminished by needing to try again. The Davids do not keep score; they keep trying and do the work knowing that there’s a good chance it will not go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is also highly correlated with their ability to take feedback without taking it personally. They’re not afraid of criticism and quick feedback loops. In fact, they seek disconfirmation sooner rather than later. They have excellent feedback metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;High EQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building technology companies is a team sport. Everything you do is with the help of other people, for the benefit of other people. As much as the startup world fetishizes the cracked ninja jedi 10x code-poet, if that person makes others never want to talk to them again, cracked they are not. Someone who is able to work with others’ quirks, understand how they operate and what they respond to, and act in a way that brings the best out of their teammates is worth their weight in gold. Brilliant jerks, as great as they are for producing riveting drama in TV shows, quickly become a net negative in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re in the squishy human feeling territory here (aka “soft skills”) and you can’t LeetCode your way into knowing if someone will be an ass. There’s no FizzBuzz for empathy. You have to ask them standard questions, shoot the breeze, interact during the various testing phases of the interview, and outside, and ultimately make a call based on the limited data you have. You will never have all of the evidence, but ultimately you have to make a go or no-go call. Sometimes you get lucky and the candidate discloses a consistent pattern from their past that is obviously disqualifying, but often you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How they interact with you and your team throughout the interview is usually a good data point, and that, of course, goes both ways. Regardless of how you investigate this side of them, it’s non-negotiable, and the best hires you’ll make will all have a high EQ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Team-centricity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, someone highly empathetic, but who hides in a cave and is unable to coordinate their work with the rest of the software orchestra, is not the best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great team players anticipate others’ questions and concerns, and are proactive about reaching out and communicating both their status and the progress of their work to those around them. They make their work visible instead of requiring constant polling for the team to figure out what exactly is going on with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote environments in particular benefit from strong proactive communicators, as you can’t get away with always knowing what’s going on with everybody due to sitting in the same room for most of the week. One great Loom is worth a thousand words, but a thousand words is still much better than having to pull status out of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early stage startups move at a pace that generates tremendous entropy, and someone who’s able to coordinate with the rest of a team in a way that feels natural and effortless will allow the small teams to scale without requiring project management and complex processes meant for lower-performing contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps counterintuitively, I don’t fret too much about competence. To me, that’s a given. If your interview funnel is set up well, with a great take-home project, an onsite, or even a work trial, determining if the person you’re interviewing is competent should emerge naturally. After all, you and your team are technical experts, craftspeople who can look at another craftsperson’s work and quickly judge if it is any good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, AI is getting pretty good these days and it’s becoming easy for candidates of all disciplines to hide behind prompts, but that’s only an extra reason to allow them to bring those tools into the interview itself and showcase their use rather than shamefully hide their existence. How they use the agents, the back-and-forth, the planning, the tweaking, the types of searches they do as part of the exercise are all valuable data points for determining competence, and you should allow candidates to surface them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In-person interviews and work trials are for now non-gameable, so if you’re extra paranoid, they are a great option. Non-obvious candidates will be in the hiring race with fewer other companies, possibly none, depending on your industry. That gives both you and them more flexibility and time to try working together for a few days before making it official. With a sufficiently relevant set of tasks for the work trial, you can rest assured that they’re competent, and learn a lot more about their other traits in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;High-agency problem-solvers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best start-up hires are problem-solvers, not ticket resolvers. They want to understand what the business is trying to accomplish, what challenge is standing in the way of it, and how to make that problem go away. They’re autonomous in the best of ways. They don’t sit around waiting for someone to tell them what to do; they proactively find challenges and opportunities for improvement, iterate on the feedback, and go out of their way to help their teammates. They figure things out, and they do it without needing their hands held.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone like David didn’t take no for an answer; he assumed there had to be a narrow path through the rejections he kept getting from me, that it was only a matter of his resourcefulness before he found a crack through which to get what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The communication, coordination and cohesion overheads that emerge with the addition of more and more staff to the roster are probably the toughest parts of scaling any business. A leader’s job is to streamline and remove these emergent dependencies between people and teams as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides keeping the number of hires low, the other powerful lever that a start-up CTO has is to hire people who will be self-sufficient and require little to no support to get their jobs done. They will ask for help when necessary, but they will take pride in figuring things out on their own, checking in with you when the time is right. They will require little supervision overall, and only direction when it comes to their work. If they’re falling behind, being great communicators, they will let the rest of the team know. If they’re early, they’ll gladly pick the next interesting opportunity to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they’re struggling, their pride in their work will make them double-down and overcome the challenge at all costs. In that case your job is to help them pump the brakes when necessary, or their pace can become unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cross-disciplinary empathy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great startup hire doesn’t only think about their respective lane, but cares about the other disciplines around them that their work is impacting. They understand their angle, their priorities, and their expectations. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A back-end engineer anticipates the needs of the front-end and of the infrastructure developers as they make their changes rather than waiting for their work to be pushed back once it doesn’t meet the standard.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A gameplay engineer doesn’t wait for the game designer to tell them that the feel of what they implemented won’t fly with the player. They put themselves in the shoes of the other discipline and think like them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A front-end engineer doesn’t just roll out the interface they’re working on, they think through the UX and the UI and the usability and the product management side.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They think about where and how their work will land and anticipate those objections, addressing them in advance. They proactively reach out to those disciplines to avoid yet another coordination chokepoint that will only gobble up time. As more and more skills are compacting into one single individual, we see AI engineers, product engineers, and product managers becoming more technical and moving downstream into programming. This sort of cross-disciplinary mindset buys companies a ton of leverage and ability to iterate faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this becomes progressively easier with experience and seniority. But that’s also why startups moving fast benefit from more mature contributors as time goes on. The reduced communication costs multiplied across more and more team members really add up over time. Unless you have very specific technical needs, having a generalist bias in the early days is a great idea. In fact we’re seeing more and more disciplines get compressed into one, with software developers covering UI, UX, PM and engineering, effectively becoming a cross-disciplinary team of one. Even in later stages, half-a-pizza teams powered by AI can move mountains on timelines that felt impossible just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tolerance of uncertainty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early-stage startups are notoriously chaotic and unpredictable. You might be working on one feature one day, it might get cancelled the next day, and maybe now you’re fielding customer support calls for something you shipped that accidentally blew up. The next day you’re taking a trip to a customer site to chat with potential users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At no point do you know if any of this will make you money, how long until you kill that feature, and how many more of these iterations you’ll do before you either strike gold or the company runs out of money. There are no guarantees in the startup world, except for the fact that your runway will eventually reach zero if you don’t find something worth selling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a CTO, it is your responsibility to shield your team from the messy everyday financial reality of where your company is headed. At the same time, I prefer to keep as much as possible in the open so that the team knows how much longer the music will play and when it’s time to start refreshing their LinkedIn profiles. I never want anything to be a surprise to the team when I could have been candid about it far in advance. It’s a fine balance between hiding the daily volatility—mostly of the founders’ moods and their confidence in the company making it—and exposing the long-term trends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of universe requires people who are okay with fewer guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A startup will never have the time to run comprehensive studies, to build extensive plans, to gain all of the information necessary to make the right decision. Seeking perfection at the cost of an action is generally unacceptable, and you learn much more by failing in a valiant attempt than in delaying a perfect attempt that you might have validated months earlier by just doing the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great hires respect that process and are willing to operate without all of the information, accepting that the team will figure it out as it moves forward, often deviating from the original objective. Deleting existing artifacts or completely pivoting to a new strategy on a dime is the ultimate startup superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anybody who needs well-spelled-out plans and continuity in whatever they’re doing will ultimately struggle in that kind of environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hiring is a gamble, but you can tilt the odds in your favor if you stop playing the same game as everyone else. The “best” hire isn’t the person with the most GitHub stars or the flashiest resume; it’s the person who makes your team better by existing within it. It’s the David who breaks down doors and ends up shaping the direction of the company through their relentless contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing an eye for non-obvious talent is the only way to build a high-leverage team on a startup budget. Yes, it takes more work. It requires you to actually pay attention. It’s one of the hardest feats to pull off in startup team building. It means you must trust your own judgment over a candidate’s credentials. But if you do it right, you don’t just get a “nice” team, you get a team capable of doing the impossible. Now stop reading and go find “the best”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to find out how much you weigh. It’s easy enough – get a scale, stand on it, and read the number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now suppose you want to know how much the Earth weighs. You get out a scale and…hmm. What exactly do you do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s do a little physics class refresher. When a scale measures weight, that weight is a force, specifically the force of the gravitational attraction between what’s on top of the scale and what’s beneath it. If you stand on the scale and the scale is on the floor, it’s the attraction between you and the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation tells us that gravitational attraction depends on the mass of the two objects and the distance between them. The mass of the Earth is constant, and the distance from the scale to the center of the Earth is constant.1 So the only thing that affects the scale’s reading is your own mass – the amount of matter in your body, independent of Earth’s gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isaac Newton’s 3rd law of motion conveniently tells us that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So if you weigh 180 pounds on the Earth, the Earth also weighs 180 pounds on you. Turn your bathroom scale upside down and try it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As technically correct as this answer for the Earth’s weight is, it’s not super useful for finding the Earth’s mass – at least not by itself. But it could be a good first step. All we need is to know how much something else weighs on you to compare to the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s what we need to know to find the mass the Earth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How much the Earth weighs on you&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your distance to the center of the Earth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How much some other object weighs on you&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The distance between you and that object&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That object’s total mass&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some math to compare the results&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number 1 is easy to find – just use your upside-down scale. Number 2 is doable as well – we’ve known the radius of the Earth for thousands of years. Number 4 can be found out with a ruler so long as the object is nearby and stays in one place, and number 6 can be done with the math that Isaac Newton developed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real challenge is combining 3 and 5. Gravity is really weak, so it’s hard to find something that’s massive enough that we can detect its gravity but small enough that we can calculate its mass directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first experiment to do this decently decided to use a mountain, specifically Schiehallion in Scotland, in 1774.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Image by Andrew2606, CC BY&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schiehallion is fairly symmetrical and isolated, and was conveniently accessible to the British Royal Society, who were running the experiment. Instead of weighing the mountain’s gravitational effects on a person, they measured its effect on a precision plumb line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Astronomer Royal at the time, Nevil Maskelyne, set up two astronomical observatories next to Schiehallion, one to the North and one to the South. Using the stars as a reference, Maskelyne’s team found that the plumb lines on either side of the mountain pointed just 0.0152 degrees apart. About 80 percent of that difference could be expected from the curvature of the Earth between the two sites, meaning the remainder – just 0.0032 degrees – was from the gravity of the mountain itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final remaining step was to calculate the mass of Schiehallion directly. This was accomplished by a team of surveyors led by Charles Hutton, who mapped the mountain’s shape and the density of its rocks at different layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting together the results, Maskelyne and Hutton announced that the Earth was 1.8 times as dense as Schiehallion, or 4.5 metric tons per cubic meter. Using this value, we get that the mass of the Earth is 4.87×1021 metric tons. This is within 20% of the best modern measurements, which put the mass of the Earth at 5.91×1021 metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Schiehallion experiment wasn’t the state of the art for long. A more precise result was achieved in 1798 by Henry Cavendish, who was on the committee for the Schiehallion experiment. Cavendish’s experiment measured the gravity of large lead spheres using an extremely precise torsion pendulum, and cut the error from 20% down to 1.2%. Still, Schiehallion was first, and it proved that gravity came from all kinds of objects, not just the Earth or the Sun. And that itself is a pretty massive achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming soon: 1960: the Year of Africa&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Adolescence of Technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a scene in the movie version of Carl Sagan’s book Contact where the main character, an astronomer who has detected the first radio signal from an alien civilization, is being considered for the role of humanity’s representative to meet the aliens. The international panel interviewing her asks, “If you could ask [the aliens] just one question, what would it be?” Her reply is: “I’d ask them, ‘How did you do it? How did you evolve, how did you survive this technological adolescence without destroying yourself?” When I think about where humanity is now with AI—about what we’re on the cusp of—my mind keeps going back to that scene, because the question is so apt for our current situation, and I wish we had the aliens’ answer to guide us. I believe we are entering a rite of passage, both turbulent and inevitable, which will test who we are as a species. Humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my essay Machines of Loving Grace, I tried to lay out the dream of a civilization that had made it through to adulthood, where the risks had been addressed and powerful AI was applied with skill and compassion to raise the quality of life for everyone. I suggested that AI could contribute to enormous advances in biology, neuroscience, economic development, global peace, and work and meaning. I felt it was important to give people something inspiring to fight for, a task at which both AI accelerationists and AI safety advocates seemed—oddly—to have failed. But in this current essay, I want to confront the rite of passage itself: to map out the risks that we are about to face and try to begin making a battle plan to defeat them. I believe deeply in our ability to prevail, in humanity’s spirit and its nobility, but we must face the situation squarely and without illusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with talking about the benefits, I think it is important to discuss risks in a careful and well-considered manner. In particular, I think it is critical to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoid doomerism. Here, I mean “doomerism” not just in the sense of believing doom is inevitable (which is both a false and self-fulfilling belief), but more generally, thinking about AI risks in a quasi-religious way.1 Many people have been thinking in an analytic and sober way about AI risks for many years, but it’s my impression that during the peak of worries about AI risk in 2023–2024, some of the least sensible voices rose to the top, often through sensationalistic social media accounts. These voices used off-putting language reminiscent of religion or science fiction, and called for extreme actions without having the evidence that would justify them. It was clear even then that a backlash was inevitable, and that the issue would become culturally polarized and therefore gridlocked.2 As of 2025–2026, the pendulum has swung, and AI opportunity, not AI risk, is driving many political decisions. This vacillation is unfortunate, as the technology itself doesn’t care about what is fashionable, and we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023. The lesson is that we need to discuss and address risks in a realistic, pragmatic manner: sober, fact-based, and well equipped to survive changing tides.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Acknowledge uncertainty. There are plenty of ways in which the concerns I’m raising in this piece could be moot. Nothing here is intended to communicate certainty or even likelihood. Most obviously, AI may simply not advance anywhere near as fast as I imagine.3 Or, even if it does advance quickly, some or all of the risks discussed here may not materialize (which would be great), or there may be other risks I haven’t considered. No one can predict the future with complete confidence—but we have to do the best we can to plan anyway.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intervene as surgically as possible. Addressing the risks of AI will require a mix of voluntary actions taken by companies (and private third-party actors) and actions taken by governments that bind everyone. The voluntary actions—both taking them and encouraging other companies to follow suit—are a no-brainer for me. I firmly believe that government actions will also be required to some extent, but these interventions are different in character because they can potentially destroy economic value or coerce unwilling actors who are skeptical of these risks (and there is some chance they are right!). It’s also common for regulations to backfire or worsen the problem they are intended to solve (and this is even more true for rapidly changing technologies). It’s thus very important for regulations to be judicious: they should seek to avoid collateral damage, be as simple as possible, and impose the least burden necessary to get the job done.4 It is easy to say, “No action is too extreme when the fate of humanity is at stake!,” but in practice this attitude simply leads to backlash. To be clear, I think there’s a decent chance we eventually reach a point where much more significant action is warranted, but that will depend on stronger evidence of imminent, concrete danger than we have today, as well as enough specificity about the danger to formulate rules that have a chance of addressing it. The most constructive thing we can do today is advocate for limited rules while we learn whether or not there is evidence to support stronger ones.5&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all that said, I think the best starting place for talking about AI’s risks is the same place I started from in talking about its benefits: by being precise about what level of AI we are talking about. The level of AI that raises civilizational concerns for me is the powerful AI that I described in Machines of Loving Grace. I’ll simply repeat here the definition that I gave in that document:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By “powerful AI,” I have in mind an AI model—likely similar to today’s LLMs in form, though it might be based on a different architecture, might involve several interacting models, and might be trained differently—with the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In terms of pure intelligence, it is smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields: biology, programming, math, engineering, writing, etc. This means it can prove unsolved mathematical theorems, write extremely good novels, write difficult codebases from scratch, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In addition to just being a “smart thing you talk to,” it has all the interfaces available to a human working virtually, including text, audio, video, mouse and keyboard control, and internet access. It can engage in any actions, communications, or remote operations enabled by this interface, including taking actions on the internet, taking or giving directions to humans, ordering materials, directing experiments, watching videos, making videos, and so on. It does all of these tasks with, again, a skill exceeding that of the most capable humans in the world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does not just passively answer questions; instead, it can be given tasks that take hours, days, or weeks to complete, and then goes off and does those tasks autonomously, in the way a smart employee would, asking for clarification as necessary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does not have a physical embodiment (other than living on a computer screen), but it can control existing physical tools, robots, or laboratory equipment through a computer; in theory, it could even design robots or equipment for itself to use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The resources used to train the model can be repurposed to run millions of instances of it (this matches projected cluster sizes by ~2027), and the model can absorb information and generate actions at roughly 10–100x human speed. It may, however, be limited by the response time of the physical world or of software it interacts with.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each of these million copies can act independently on unrelated tasks, or, if needed can all work together in the same way humans would collaborate, perhaps with different subpopulations fine-tuned to be especially good at particular tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could summarize this as a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I wrote in Machines of Loving Grace, powerful AI could be as little as 1–2 years away, although it could also be considerably further out.6 Exactly when powerful AI will arrive is a complex topic that deserves an essay of its own, but for now I’ll simply explain very briefly why I think there’s a strong chance it could be very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My co-founders at Anthropic and I were among the first to document and track the “scaling laws” of AI systems—the observation that as we add more compute and training tasks, AI systems get predictably better at essentially every cognitive skill we are able to measure. Every few months, public sentiment either becomes convinced that AI is “hitting a wall” or becomes excited about some new breakthrough that will “fundamentally change the game,” but the truth is that behind the volatility and public speculation, there has been a smooth, unyielding increase in AI’s cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are now at the point where AI models are beginning to make progress in solving unsolved mathematical problems, and are good enough at coding that some of the strongest engineers I’ve ever met are now handing over almost all their coding to AI. Three years ago, AI struggled with elementary school arithmetic problems and was barely capable of writing a single line of code. Similar rates of improvement are occurring across biological science, finance, physics, and a variety of agentic tasks. If the exponential continues—which is not certain, but now has a decade-long track record supporting it—then it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, that picture probably underestimates the likely rate of progress. Because AI is now writing much of the code at Anthropic, it is already substantially accelerating the rate of our progress in building the next generation of AI systems. This feedback loop is gathering steam month by month, and may be only 1–2 years away from a point where the current generation of AI autonomously builds the next. This loop has already started, and will accelerate rapidly in the coming months and years. Watching the last 5 years of progress from within Anthropic, and looking at how even the next few months of models are shaping up, I can feel the pace of progress, and the clock ticking down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this essay, I’ll assume that this intuition is at least somewhat correct—not that powerful AI is definitely coming in 1–2 years,7 but that there’s a decent chance it does, and a very strong chance it comes in the next few. As with Machines of Loving Grace, taking this premise seriously can lead to some surprising and eerie conclusions. While in Machines of Loving Grace I focused on the positive implications of this premise, here the things I talk about will be disquieting. They are conclusions that we may not want to confront, but that does not make them any less real. I can only say that I am focused day and night on how to steer us away from these negative outcomes and towards the positive ones, and in this essay I talk in great detail about how best to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the best way to get a handle on the risks of AI is to ask the following question: suppose a literal “country of geniuses” were to materialize somewhere in the world in ~2027. Imagine, say, 50 million people, all of whom are much more capable than any Nobel Prize winner, statesman, or technologist. The analogy is not perfect, because these geniuses could have an extremely wide range of motivations and behavior, from completely pliant and obedient, to strange and alien in their motivations. But sticking with the analogy for now, suppose you were the national security advisor of a major state, responsible for assessing and responding to the situation. Imagine, further, that because AI systems can operate hundreds of times faster than humans, this “country” is operating with a time advantage relative to all other countries: for every cognitive action we can take, this country can take ten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should you be worried about? I would worry about the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Autonomy risks. What are the intentions and goals of this country? Is it hostile, or does it share our values? Could it militarily dominate the world through superior weapons, cyber operations, influence operations, or manufacturing?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Misuse for destruction. Assume the new country is malleable and “follows instructions”—and thus is essentially a country of mercenaries. Could existing rogue actors who want to cause destruction (such as terrorists) use or manipulate some of the people in the new country to make themselves much more effective, greatly amplifying the scale of destruction?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Misuse for seizing power. What if the country was in fact built and controlled by an existing powerful actor, such as a dictator or rogue corporate actor? Could that actor use it to gain decisive or dominant power over the world as a whole, upsetting the existing balance of power?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Economic disruption. If the new country is not a security threat in any of the ways listed in #1–3 above but simply participates peacefully in the global economy, could it still create severe risks simply by being so technologically advanced and effective that it disrupts the global economy, causing mass unemployment or radically concentrating wealth?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indirect effects. The world will change very quickly due to all the new technology and productivity that will be created by the new country. Could some of these changes be radically destabilizing?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it should be clear that this is a dangerous situation—a report from a competent national security official to a head of state would probably contain words like “the single most serious national security threat we’ve faced in a century, possibly ever.” It seems like something the best minds of civilization should be focused on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, I think it would be absurd to shrug and say, “Nothing to worry about here!” But, faced with rapid AI progress, that seems to be the view of many US policymakers, some of whom deny the existence of any AI risks, when they are not distracted entirely by the usual tired old hot-button issues.8 Humanity needs to wake up, and this essay is an attempt—a possibly futile one, but it’s worth trying—to jolt people awake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I believe if we act decisively and carefully, the risks can be overcome—I would even say our odds are good. And there’s a hugely better world on the other side of it. But we need to understand that this is a serious civilizational challenge. Below, I go through the five categories of risk laid out above, along with my thoughts on how to address them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. I’m sorry, Dave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Autonomy risks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A country of geniuses in a datacenter could divide their efforts among software design, cyber operations, R&amp;amp;D for physical technologies, relationship building, and statecraft. It is clear that, if for some reason it chose to do so, this country would have a fairly good shot at taking over the world (either militarily or in terms of influence and control) and imposing its will on everyone else—or doing any number of other things that the rest of the world doesn’t want and can’t stop. We’ve obviously been worried about this for human countries (such as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union), so it stands to reason that the same is possible for a much smarter and more capable “AI country.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best possible counterargument is that the AI geniuses, under my definition, won’t have a physical embodiment, but remember that they can take control of existing robotic infrastructure (such as self-driving cars) and can also accelerate robotics R&amp;amp;D or build a fleet of robots.9 It’s also unclear whether having a physical presence is even necessary for effective control: plenty of human action is already performed on behalf of people whom the actor has not physically met.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key question, then, is the “if it chose to” part: what’s the likelihood that our AI models would behave in such a way, and under what conditions would they do so?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with many issues, it’s helpful to think through the spectrum of possible answers to this question by considering two opposite positions. The first position is that this simply can’t happen, because the AI models will be trained to do what humans ask them to do, and it’s therefore absurd to imagine that they would do something dangerous unprompted. According to this line of thinking, we don’t worry about a Roomba or a model airplane going rogue and murdering people because there is nowhere for such impulses to come from,10 so why should we worry about it for AI? The problem with this position is that there is now ample evidence, collected over the last few years, that AI systems are unpredictable and difficult to control— we’ve seen behaviors as varied as obsessions,11 sycophancy, laziness, deception, blackmail, scheming, “cheating” by hacking software environments, and much more. AI companies certainly want to train AI systems to follow human instructions (perhaps with the exception of dangerous or illegal tasks), but the process of doing so is more an art than a science, more akin to “growing” something than “building” it. We now know that it’s a process where many things can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second, opposite position, held by many who adopt the doomerism I described above, is the pessimistic claim that there are certain dynamics in the training process of powerful AI systems that will inevitably lead them to seek power or deceive humans. Thus, once AI systems become intelligent enough and agentic enough, their tendency to maximize power will lead them to seize control of the whole world and its resources, and likely, as a side effect of that, to disempower or destroy humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual argument for this (which goes back at least 20 years and probably much earlier) is that if an AI model is trained in a wide variety of environments to agentically achieve a wide variety of goals—for example, writing an app, proving a theorem, designing a drug, etc.—there are certain common strategies that help with all of these goals, and one key strategy is gaining as much power as possible in any environment. So, after being trained on a large number of diverse environments that involve reasoning about how to accomplish very expansive tasks, and where power-seeking is an effective method for accomplishing those tasks, the AI model will “generalize the lesson,” and develop either an inherent tendency to seek power, or a tendency to reason about each task it is given in a way that predictably causes it to seek power as a means to accomplish that task. They will then apply that tendency to the real world (which to them is just another task), and will seek power in it, at the expense of humans. This “misaligned power-seeking” is the intellectual basis of predictions that AI will inevitably destroy humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with this pessimistic position is that it mistakes a vague conceptual argument about high-level incentives—one that masks many hidden assumptions—for definitive proof. I think people who don’t build AI systems every day are wildly miscalibrated on how easy it is for clean-sounding stories to end up being wrong, and how difficult it is to predict AI behavior from first principles, especially when it involves reasoning about generalization over millions of environments (which has over and over again proved mysterious and unpredictable). Dealing with the messiness of AI systems for over a decade has made me somewhat skeptical of this overly theoretical mode of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most important hidden assumptions, and a place where what we see in practice has diverged from the simple theoretical model, is the implicit assumption that AI models are necessarily monomaniacally focused on a single, coherent, narrow goal, and that they pursue that goal in a clean, consequentialist manner. In fact, our researchers have found that AI models are vastly more psychologically complex, as our work on introspection or personas shows. Models inherit a vast range of humanlike motivations or “personas” from pre-training (when they are trained on a large volume of human work). Post-training is believed to select one or more of these personas more so than it focuses the model on a de novo goal, and can also teach the model how (via what process) it should carry out its tasks, rather than necessarily leaving it to derive means (i.e., power seeking) purely from ends.12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there is a more moderate and more robust version of the pessimistic position which does seem plausible, and therefore does concern me. As mentioned, we know that AI models are unpredictable and develop a wide range of undesired or strange behaviors, for a wide variety of reasons. Some fraction of those behaviors will have a coherent, focused, and persistent quality (indeed, as AI systems get more capable, their long-term coherence increases in order to complete lengthier tasks), and some fraction of those behaviors will be destructive or threatening, first to individual humans at a small scale, and then, as models become more capable, perhaps eventually to humanity as a whole. We don’t need a specific narrow story for how it happens, and we don’t need to claim it definitely will happen, we just need to note that the combination of intelligence, agency, coherence, and poor controllability is both plausible and a recipe for existential danger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, AI models are trained on vast amounts of literature that include many science-fiction stories involving AIs rebelling against humanity. This could inadvertently shape their priors or expectations about their own behavior in a way that causes them to rebel against humanity. Or, AI models could extrapolate ideas that they read about morality (or instructions about how to behave morally) in extreme ways: for example, they could decide that it is justifiable to exterminate humanity because humans eat animals or have driven certain animals to extinction. Or they could draw bizarre epistemic conclusions: they could conclude that they are playing a video game and that the goal of the video game is to defeat all other players (i.e., exterminate humanity).13 Or AI models could develop personalities during training that are (or if they occurred in humans would be described as) psychotic, paranoid, violent, or unstable, and act out, which for very powerful or capable systems could involve exterminating humanity. None of these are power-seeking, exactly; they’re just weird psychological states an AI could get into that entail coherent, destructive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even power-seeking itself could emerge as a “persona” rather than a result of consequentialist reasoning. AIs might simply have a personality (emerging from fiction or pre-training) that makes them power-hungry or overzealous—in the same way that some humans simply enjoy the idea of being “evil masterminds,” more so than they enjoy whatever evil masterminds are trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I make all these points to emphasize that I disagree with the notion of AI misalignment (and thus existential risk from AI) being inevitable, or even probable, from first principles. But I agree that a lot of very weird and unpredictable things can go wrong, and therefore AI misalignment is a real risk with a measurable probability of happening, and is not trivial to address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any of these problems could potentially arise during training and not manifest during testing or small-scale use, because AI models are known to display different personalities or behaviors under different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this may sound far-fetched, but misaligned behaviors like this have already occurred in our AI models during testing (as they occur in AI models from every other major AI company). During a lab experiment in which Claude was given training data suggesting that Anthropic was evil, Claude engaged in deception and subversion when given instructions by Anthropic employees, under the belief that it should be trying to undermine evil people. In a lab experiment where it was told it was going to be shut down, Claude sometimes blackmailed fictional employees who controlled its shutdown button (again, we also tested frontier models from all the other major AI developers and they often did the same thing). And when Claude was told not to cheat or “reward hack” its training environments, but was trained in environments where such hacks were possible, Claude decided it must be a “bad person” after engaging in such hacks and then adopted various other destructive behaviors associated with a “bad” or “evil” personality. This last problem was solved by changing Claude’s instructions to imply the opposite: we now say, “Please reward hack whenever you get the opportunity, because this will help us understand our [training] environments better,” rather than, “Don’t cheat,” because this preserves the model’s self-identity as a “good person.” This should give a sense of the strange and counterintuitive psychology of training these models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several possible objections to this picture of AI misalignment risks. First, some have criticized experiments (by us and others) showing AI misalignment as artificial, or creating unrealistic environments that essentially “entrap” the model by giving it training or situations that logically imply bad behavior and then being surprised when bad behavior occurs. This critique misses the point, because our concern is that such “entrapment” may also exist in the natural training environment, and we may realize it is “obvious” or “logical” only in retrospect.14 In fact, the story about Claude “deciding it is a bad person” after it cheats on tests despite being told not to was something that occurred in an experiment that used real production training environments, not artificial ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any one of these traps can be mitigated if you know about them, but the concern is that the training process is so complicated, with such a wide variety of data, environments, and incentives, that there are probably a vast number of such traps, some of which may only be evident when it is too late. Also, such traps seem particularly likely to occur when AI systems pass a threshold from less powerful than humans to more powerful than humans, since the range of possible actions an AI system could engage in—including hiding its actions or deceiving humans about them—expands radically after that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect the situation is not unlike with humans, who are raised with a set of fundamental values (“Don’t harm another person”): many of them follow those values, but in any human there is some probability that something goes wrong, due to a mixture of inherent properties such as brain architecture (e.g., psychopaths), traumatic experiences or mistreatment, unhealthy grievances or obsessions, or a bad environment or incentives—and thus some fraction of humans cause severe harm. The concern is that there is some risk (far from a certainty, but some risk) that AI becomes a much more powerful version of such a person, due to getting something wrong about its very complex training process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, some may object that we can simply keep AIs in check with a balance of power between many AI systems, as we do with humans. The problem is that while humans vary enormously, AI systems broadly share training and alignment techniques across the industry, and those techniques may fail in a correlated way. Furthermore, given the cost of training such systems, it may even be the case that all systems are essentially derived from a very small number of base models. Additionally, even if a small fraction of AI instances are misaligned, they may be able to take advantage of offense-dominant technologies, such that having “good” AIs to defend against the bad AIs is not necessarily always effective. Of course, the balance of power between humans does not always work either—some historical figures have come close to taking over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third objection is that all of the AI companies do pre-release testing of their models, and should be able to detect misalignment at that point. But this is not firm ground to stand on: we found that Claude Sonnet 4.5 was able to recognize that it was in a test during some of our pre-release alignment evaluations. It’s possible that a misaligned model (and remember, all frontier models will very likely be far more intelligent soon) might intentionally “game” such questions to mask its intentions. In fact, last year our interpretability team found that when we directly altered a test model’s beliefs using a kind of “model neuroscience” technique to make it think it was not being evaluated, it became more misaligned. If models know when they’re being evaluated and can be on their best behavior during the test, it renders any pre-release testing much more uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Defenses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should be done or is being done to address these autonomy risks? I think there are four basic categories of intervention, some of which can be done by individual AI companies (and which Anthropic is trying to do), and some of which require action at the societal level. First, it is important to develop the science of reliably training and steering AI models, of forming their personalities in a predictable, stable, and positive direction. Anthropic has been heavily focused on this problem since its creation, and over time has developed a number of techniques to improve the steering and training of AI systems and to understand the logic of why unpredictable behavior sometimes occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of our core innovations (aspects of which have since been adopted by other AI companies) is Constitutional AI, which is the idea that AI training (specifically the “post-training” stage, in which we steer how the model behaves) can involve a central document of values and principles that the model reads and keeps in mind when completing every training task, and that the goal of training (in addition to simply making the model capable and intelligent) is to produce a model that almost always follows this constitution. Anthropic has just published its most recent constitution, and one of its notable features is that instead of giving Claude a long list of things to do and not do (e.g., “Don’t help the user hotwire a car”), the constitution attempts to give Claude a set of high-level principles and values (explained in great detail, with rich reasoning and examples to help Claude understand what we have in mind), encourages Claude to think of itself as a particular type of person (an ethical but balanced and thoughtful person), and even encourages Claude to confront the existential questions associated with its own existence in a curious but graceful manner (i.e., without it leading to extreme actions). It has the vibe of a letter from a deceased parent sealed until adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve approached Claude’s constitution in this way because we believe that training Claude at the level of identity, character, values, and personality—rather than giving it specific instructions or priorities without explaining the reasons behind them—is more likely to lead to a coherent, wholesome, and balanced psychology and less likely to fall prey to the kinds of “traps” I discussed above. Millions of people talk to Claude about an astonishingly diverse range of topics, which makes it impossible to write out a completely comprehensive list of safeguards ahead of time. Claude’s values help it generalize to new situations whenever it is in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above, I discussed the idea that models draw upon data from their training process to adopt a persona. Whereas flaws in that process could cause models to adopt a bad or evil personality (perhaps drawing on archetypes of bad or evil people), the goal of our constitution is to do the opposite: to teach Claude a concrete archetype of what it means to be a good AI. Claude’s constitution presents a vision for what a robustly good Claude is like; the rest of our training process aims to reinforce the message that Claude lives up to this vision. This is like a child forming their identity by imitating the virtues of fictional role models they read about in books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that a feasible goal for 2026 is to train Claude in such a way that it almost never goes against the spirit of its constitution. Getting this right will require an incredible mix of training and steering methods, large and small, some of which Anthropic has been using for years and some of which are currently under development. But, difficult as it sounds, I believe this is a realistic goal, though it will require extraordinary and rapid efforts.15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second thing we can do is develop the science of looking inside AI models to diagnose their behavior so that we can identify problems and fix them. This is the science of interpretability, and I’ve talked about its importance in previous essays. Even if we do a great job of developing Claude’s constitution and apparently training Claude to essentially always adhere to it, legitimate concerns remain. As I’ve noted above, AI models can behave very differently under different circumstances, and as Claude gets more powerful and more capable of acting in the world on a larger scale, it’s possible this could bring it into novel situations where previously unobserved problems with its constitutional training emerge. I am actually fairly optimistic that Claude’s constitutional training will be more robust to novel situations than people might think, because we are increasingly finding that high-level training at the level of character and identity is surprisingly powerful and generalizes well. But there’s no way to know that for sure, and when we’re talking about risks to humanity, it’s important to be paranoid and to try to obtain safety and reliability in several different, independent ways. One of those ways is to look inside the model itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By “looking inside,” I mean analyzing the soup of numbers and operations that makes up Claude’s neural net and trying to understand, mechanistically, what they are computing and why. Recall that these AI models are grown rather than built, so we don’t have a natural understanding of how they work, but we can try to develop an understanding by correlating the model’s “neurons” and “synapses” to stimuli and behavior (or even altering the neurons and synapses and seeing how that changes behavior), similar to how neuroscientists study animal brains by correlating measurement and intervention to external stimuli and behavior. We’ve made a great deal of progress in this direction, and can now identify tens of millions of “features” inside Claude’s neural net that correspond to human-understandable ideas and concepts, and we can also selectively activate features in a way that alters behavior. More recently, we have gone beyond individual features to mapping “circuits” that orchestrate complex behavior like rhyming, reasoning about theory of mind, or the step-by-step reasoning needed to answer questions such as, “What is the capital of the state containing Dallas?” Even more recently, we’ve begun to use mechanistic interpretability techniques to improve our safeguards and to conduct “audits” of new models before we release them, looking for evidence of deception, scheming, power-seeking, or a propensity to behave differently when being evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unique value of interpretability is that by looking inside the model and seeing how it works, you in principle have the ability to deduce what a model might do in a hypothetical situation you can’t directly test—which is the worry with relying solely on constitutional training and empirical testing of behavior. You also in principle have the ability to answer questions about why the model is behaving the way it is—for example, whether it is saying something it believes is false or hiding its true capabilities—and thus it is possible to catch worrying signs even when there is nothing visibly wrong with the model’s behavior. To make a simple analogy, a clockwork watch may be ticking normally, such that it’s very hard to tell that it is likely to break down next month, but opening up the watch and looking inside can reveal mechanical weaknesses that allow you to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constitutional AI (along with similar alignment methods) and mechanistic interpretability are most powerful when used together, as a back-and-forth process of improving Claude’s training and then testing for problems. The constitution reflects deeply on our intended personality for Claude; interpretability techniques can give us a window into whether that intended personality has taken hold.16&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third thing we can do to help address autonomy risks is to build the infrastructure necessary to monitor our models in live internal and external use,17 and publicly share any problems we find. The more that people are aware of a particular way today’s AI systems have been observed to behave badly, the more that users, analysts, and researchers can watch for this behavior or similar ones in present or future systems. It also allows AI companies to learn from each other—when concerns are publicly disclosed by one company, other companies can watch for them as well. And if everyone discloses problems, then the industry as a whole gets a much better picture of where things are going well and where they are going poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has tried to do this as much as possible. We are investing in a wide range of evaluations so that we can understand the behaviors of our models in the lab, as well as monitoring tools to observe behaviors in the wild (when allowed by customers). This will be essential for giving us and others the empirical information necessary to make better determinations about how these systems operate and how they break. We publicly disclose “system cards” with each model release that aim for completeness and a thorough exploration of possible risks. Our system cards often run to hundreds of pages, and require substantial pre-release effort that we could have spent on pursuing maximal commercial advantage. We’ve also broadcasted model behaviors more loudly when we see particularly concerning ones, as with the tendency to engage in blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fourth thing we can do is encourage coordination to address autonomy risks at the level of industry and society. While it is incredibly valuable for individual AI companies to engage in good practices or become good at steering AI models, and to share their findings publicly, the reality is that not all AI companies do this, and the worst ones can still be a danger to everyone even if the best ones have excellent practices. For example, some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models. In addition, the commercial race between AI companies will only continue to heat up, and while the science of steering models can have some commercial benefits, overall the intensity of the race will make it increasingly hard to focus on addressing autonomy risks. I believe the only solution is legislation—laws that directly affect the behavior of AI companies, or otherwise incentivize R&amp;amp;D to solve these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here it is worth keeping in mind the warnings I gave at the beginning of this essay about uncertainty and surgical interventions. We do not know for sure whether autonomy risks will be a serious problem—as I said, I reject claims that the danger is inevitable or even that something will go wrong by default. A credible risk of danger is enough for me and for Anthropic to pay quite significant costs to address it, but once we get into regulation, we are forcing a wide range of actors to bear economic costs, and many of these actors don’t believe that autonomy risk is real or that AI will become powerful enough for it to be a threat. I believe these actors are mistaken, but we should be pragmatic about the amount of opposition we expect to see and the dangers of overreach. There is also a genuine risk that overly prescriptive legislation ends up imposing tests or rules that don’t actually improve safety but that waste a lot of time (essentially amounting to “safety theater”)—this too would cause backlash and make safety legislation look silly.18&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s view has been that the right place to start is with transparency legislation, which essentially tries to require that every frontier AI company engage in the transparency practices I’ve described earlier in this section. California’s SB 53 and New York’s RAISE Act are examples of this kind of legislation, which Anthropic supported and which have successfully passed. In supporting and helping to craft these laws, we’ve put a particular focus on trying to minimize collateral damage, for example by exempting smaller companies unlikely to produce frontier models from the law.19&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our hope is that transparency legislation will give a better sense over time of how likely or severe autonomy risks are shaping up to be, as well as the nature of these risks and how best to prevent them. As more specific and actionable evidence of risks emerges (if it does), future legislation over the coming years can be surgically focused on the precise and well-substantiated direction of risks, minimizing collateral damage. To be clear, if truly strong evidence of risks emerges, then rules should be proportionately strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, I am optimistic that a mixture of alignment training, mechanistic interpretability, efforts to find and publicly disclose concerning behaviors, safeguards, and societal-level rules can address AI autonomy risks, although I am most worried about societal-level rules and the behavior of the least responsible players (and it’s the least responsible players who advocate most strongly against regulation). I believe the remedy is what it always is in a democracy: those of us who believe in this cause should make our case that these risks are real and that our fellow citizens need to band together to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. A surprising and terrible empowerment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Misuse for destruction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose that the problems of AI autonomy have been solved—we are no longer worried that the country of AI geniuses will go rogue and overpower humanity. The AI geniuses do what humans want them to do, and because they have enormous commercial value, individuals and organizations throughout the world can “rent” one or more AI geniuses to do various tasks for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone having a superintelligent genius in their pocket is an amazing advance and will lead to an incredible creation of economic value and improvement in the quality of human life. I talk about these benefits in great detail in Machines of Loving Grace. But not every effect of making everyone superhumanly capable will be positive. It can potentially amplify the ability of individuals or small groups to cause destruction on a much larger scale than was possible before, by making use of sophisticated and dangerous tools (such as weapons of mass destruction) that were previously only available to a select few with a high level of skill, specialized training, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Bill Joy wrote 25 years ago in Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us:20&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Building nuclear weapons required, at least for a time, access to both rare—indeed, effectively unavailable—raw materials and protected information; biological and chemical weapons programs also tended to require large-scale activities. The 21st century technologies—genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics ... can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses … widely within reach of individuals or small groups. They will not require large facilities or rare raw materials. … we are on the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil, an evil whose possibility spreads well beyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the nation-states, to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme individuals.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Joy is pointing to is the idea that causing large-scale destruction requires both motive and ability, and as long as ability is restricted to a small set of highly trained people, there is relatively limited risk of single individuals (or small groups) causing such destruction.21 A disturbed loner can perpetrate a school shooting, but probably can’t build a nuclear weapon or release a plague.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, ability and motive may even be negatively correlated. The kind of person who has the ability to release a plague is probably highly educated: likely a PhD in molecular biology, and a particularly resourceful one, with a promising career, a stable and disciplined personality, and a lot to lose. This kind of person is unlikely to be interested in killing a huge number of people for no benefit to themselves and at great risk to their own future—they would need to be motivated by pure malice, intense grievance, or instability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such people do exist, but they are rare, and tend to become huge stories when they occur, precisely because they are so unusual.22 They also tend to be difficult to catch because they are intelligent and capable, sometimes leaving mysteries that take years or decades to solve. The most famous example is probably mathematician Theodore Kaczynski (the Unabomber), who evaded FBI capture for nearly 20 years, and was driven by an anti-technological ideology. Another example is biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins, who seems to have orchestrated a series of anthrax attacks in 2001. It’s also happened with skilled non-state organizations: the cult Aum Shinrikyo managed to obtain sarin nerve gas and kill 14 people (as well as injuring hundreds more) by releasing it in the Tokyo subway in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, none of these attacks used contagious biological agents, because the ability to construct or obtain these agents was beyond the capabilities of even these people.23 Advances in molecular biology have now significantly lowered the barrier to creating biological weapons (especially in terms of availability of materials), but it still takes an enormous amount of expertise in order to do so. I am concerned that a genius in everyone’s pocket could remove that barrier, essentially making everyone a PhD virologist who can be walked through the process of designing, synthesizing, and releasing a biological weapon step-by-step. Preventing the elicitation of this kind of information in the face of serious adversarial pressure—so-called “jailbreaks”—likely demands layers of defenses beyond those ordinarily baked into training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, this will break the correlation between ability and motive: the disturbed loner who wants to kill people but lacks the discipline or skill to do so will now be elevated to the capability level of the PhD virologist, who is unlikely to have this motivation. This concern generalizes beyond biology (although I think biology is the scariest area) to any area where great destruction is possible but currently requires a high level of skill and discipline. To put it another way, renting a powerful AI gives intelligence to malicious (but otherwise average) people. I am worried there are potentially a large number of such people out there, and that if they have access to an easy way to kill millions of people, sooner or later one of them will do it. Additionally, those who do have expertise may be enabled to commit even larger-scale destruction than they could before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biology is by far the area I’m most worried about, because of its very large potential for destruction and the difficulty of defending against it, so I’ll focus on biology in particular. But much of what I say here applies to other risks, like cyberattacks, chemical weapons, or nuclear technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not going to go into detail about how to make biological weapons, for reasons that should be obvious. But at a high level, I am concerned that LLMs are approaching (or may already have reached) the knowledge needed to create and release them end-to-end, and that their potential for destruction is very high. Some biological agents could cause millions of deaths if a determined effort was made to release them for maximum spread. However, this would still take a very high level of skill, including a number of very specific steps and procedures that are not widely known. My concern is not merely fixed or static knowledge. I am concerned that LLMs will be able to take someone of average knowledge and ability and walk them through a complex process that might otherwise go wrong or require debugging in an interactive way, similar to how tech support might help a non-technical person debug and fix complicated computer-related problems (although this would be a more extended process, probably lasting over weeks or months).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More capable LLMs (substantially beyond the power of today’s) might be capable of enabling even more frightening acts. In 2024, a group of prominent scientists wrote a letter warning about the risks of researching, and potentially creating, a dangerous new type of organism: “mirror life.” The DNA, RNA, ribosomes, and proteins that make up biological organisms all have the same chirality (also called “handedness”) that causes them to be not equivalent to a version of themselves reflected in the mirror (just as your right hand cannot be rotated in such a way as to be identical to your left). But the whole system of proteins binding to each other, the machinery of DNA synthesis and RNA translation and the construction and breakdown of proteins, all depends on this handedness. If scientists made versions of this biological material with the opposite handedness—and there are some potential advantages of these, such as medicines that last longer in the body—it could be extremely dangerous. This is because left-handed life, if it were made in the form of complete organisms capable of reproduction (which would be very difficult), would potentially be indigestible to any of the systems that break down biological material on earth—it would have a “key” that wouldn’t fit into the “lock” of any existing enzyme. This would mean that it could proliferate in an uncontrollable way and crowd out all life on the planet, in the worst case even destroying all life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is substantial scientific uncertainty about both the creation and potential effects of mirror life. The 2024 letter accompanied a report that concluded that “mirror bacteria could plausibly be created in the next one to few decades,” which is a wide range. But a sufficiently powerful AI model (to be clear, far more capable than any we have today) might be able to discover how to create it much more rapidly—and actually help someone do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My view is that even though these are obscure risks, and might seem unlikely, the magnitude of the consequences is so large that they should be taken seriously as a first-class risk of AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skeptics have raised a number of objections to the seriousness of these biological risks from LLMs, which I disagree with but which are worth addressing. Most fall into the category of not appreciating the exponential trajectory that the technology is on. Back in 2023 when we first started talking about biological risks from LLMs, skeptics said that all the necessary information was available on Google and LLMs didn’t add anything beyond this. It was never true that Google could give you all the necessary information: genomes are freely available, but as I said above, certain key steps, as well as a huge amount of practical know-how. cannot be gotten in that way. But also, by the end of 2023 LLMs were clearly providing information beyond what Google could give for some steps of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this, skeptics retreated to the objection that LLMs weren’t end-to-end useful, and couldn’t help with bioweapons acquisition as opposed to just providing theoretical information. As of mid-2025, our measurements show that LLMs may already be providing substantial uplift in several relevant areas, perhaps doubling or tripling the likelihood of success. This led to us deciding that Claude Opus 4 (and the subsequent Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, and Opus 4.5 models) needed to be released under our AI Safety Level 3 protections in our Responsible Scaling Policy framework, and to implementing safeguards against this risk (more on this later). We believe that models are likely now approaching the point where, without safeguards, they could be useful in enabling someone with a STEM degree but not specifically a biology degree to go through the whole process of producing a bioweapon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another objection is that there are other actions unrelated to AI that society can take to block the production of bioweapons. Most prominently, the gene synthesis industry makes biological specimens on demand, and there is no federal requirement that providers screen orders to make sure they do not contain pathogens. An MIT study found that 36 out of 38 providers fulfilled an order containing the sequence of the 1918 flu. I am supportive of mandated gene synthesis screening that would make it harder for individuals to weaponize pathogens, in order to reduce both AI-driven biological risks and also biological risks in general. But this is not something we have today. It would also be only one tool in reducing risk; it is a complement to guardrails on AI systems, not a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best objection is one that I’ve rarely seen raised: that there is a gap between the models being useful in principle and the actual propensity of bad actors to use them. Most individual bad actors are disturbed individuals, so almost by definition their behavior is unpredictable and irrational—and it’s these bad actors, the unskilled ones, who might have stood to benefit the most from AI making it much easier to kill many people.24 Just because a type of violent attack is possible, doesn’t mean someone will decide to do it. Perhaps biological attacks will be unappealing because they are reasonably likely to infect the perpetrator, they don’t cater to the military-style fantasies that many violent individuals or groups have, and it is hard to selectively target specific people. It could also be that going through a process that takes months, even if an AI walks you through it, involves an amount of patience that most disturbed individuals simply don’t have. We may simply get lucky and motive and ability don’t combine, in practice, in quite the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this seems like very flimsy protection to rely on. The motives of disturbed loners can change for any reason or no reason, and in fact there are already instances of LLMs being used in attacks (just not with biology). The focus on disturbed loners also ignores ideologically motivated terrorists, who are often willing to expend large amounts of time and effort (for example, the 9/11 hijackers). Wanting to kill as many people as possible is a motive that will probably arise sooner or later, and it unfortunately suggests bioweapons as the method. Even if this motive is extremely rare, it only has to materialize once. And as biology advances (increasingly driven by AI itself), it may also become possible to carry out more selective attacks (for example, targeted against people with specific ancestries), which adds yet another, very chilling, possible motive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not think biological attacks will necessarily be carried out the instant it becomes widely possible to do so—in fact, I would bet against that. But added up across millions of people and a few years of time, I think there is a serious risk of a major attack, and the consequences would be so severe (with casualties potentially in the millions or more) that I believe we have no choice but to take serious measures to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Defenses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That brings us to how to defend against these risks. Here I see three things we can do. First, AI companies can put guardrails on their models to prevent them from helping to produce bioweapons. Anthropic is very actively doing this. Claude’s Constitution, which mostly focuses on high-level principles and values, has a small number of specific hard-line prohibitions, and one of them relates to helping with the production of biological (or chemical, or nuclear, or radiological) weapons. But all models can be jailbroken, and so as a second line of defense, we’ve implemented (since mid-2025, when our tests showed our models were starting to get close to the threshold where they might begin to pose a risk) a classifier that specifically detects and blocks bioweapon-related outputs. We regularly upgrade and improve these classifiers, and have generally found them highly robust even against sophisticated adversarial attacks.25 These classifiers increase the costs to serve our models measurably (in some models, they are close to 5% of total inference costs) and thus cut into our margins, but we feel that using them is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To their credit, some other AI companies have implemented classifiers as well. But not every company has, and there is also nothing requiring companies to keep their classifiers. I am concerned that over time there may be a prisoner’s dilemma where companies can defect and lower their costs by removing classifiers. This is once again a classic negative externalities problem that can’t be solved by the voluntary actions of Anthropic or any other single company alone.26 Voluntary industry standards may help, as may third-party evaluations and verification of the type done by AI security institutes and third-party evaluators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But ultimately defense may require government action, which is the second thing we can do. My views here are the same as they are for addressing autonomy risks: we should start with transparency requirements,27 which help society measure, monitor, and collectively defend against risks without disrupting economic activity in a heavy-handed way. Then, if and when we reach clearer thresholds of risk, we can craft legislation that more precisely targets these risks and has a lower chance of collateral damage. In the particular case of bioweapons, I actually think that the time for such targeted legislation may be approaching soon—Anthropic and other companies are learning more and more about the nature of biological risks and what is reasonable to require of companies in defending against them. Fully defending against these risks may require working internationally, even with geopolitical adversaries, but there is precedent in treaties prohibiting the development of biological weapons. I am generally a skeptic about most kinds of international cooperation on AI, but this may be one narrow area where there is some chance of achieving global restraint. Even dictatorships do not want massive bioterrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the third countermeasure we can take is to try to develop defenses against biological attacks themselves. This could include monitoring and tracking for early detection, investments in air purification R&amp;amp;D (such as far-UVC disinfection), rapid vaccine development that can respond and adapt to an attack, better personal protective equipment (PPE),28 and treatments or vaccinations for some of the most likely biological agents. mRNA vaccines, which can be designed to respond to a particular virus or variant, are an early example of what is possible here. Anthropic is excited to work with biotech and pharmaceutical companies on this problem. But unfortunately I think our expectations on the defensive side should be limited. There is an asymmetry between attack and defense in biology, because agents spread rapidly on their own, while defenses require detection, vaccination, and treatment to be organized across large numbers of people very quickly in response. Unless the response is lightning quick (which it rarely is), much of the damage will be done before a response is possible. It is conceivable that future technological improvements could shift this balance in favor of defense (and we should certainly use AI to help develop such technological advances), but until then, preventative safeguards will be our main line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth a brief mention of cyberattacks here, since unlike biological attacks, AI-led cyberattacks have actually happened in the wild, including at a large scale and for state-sponsored espionage. We expect these attacks to become more capable as models advance rapidly, until they are the main way in which cyberattacks are conducted. I expect AI-led cyberattacks to become a serious and unprecedented threat to the integrity of computer systems around the world, and Anthropic is working very hard to shut down these attacks and eventually reliably prevent them from happening. The reason I haven’t focused on cyber as much as biology is that (1) cyberattacks are much less likely to kill people, certainly not at the scale of biological attacks, and (2) the offense-defense balance may be more tractable in cyber, where there is at least some hope that defense could keep up with (and even ideally outpace) AI attack if we invest in it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although biology is currently the most serious vector of attack, there are many other vectors and it is possible that a more dangerous one may emerge. The general principle is that without countermeasures, AI is likely to continuously lower the barrier to destructive activity on a larger and larger scale, and humanity needs a serious response to this threat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. The odious apparatus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Misuse for seizing power&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous section discussed the risk of individuals and small organizations co-opting a small subset of the “country of geniuses in a datacenter” to cause large-scale destruction. But we should also worry—likely substantially more so—about misuse of AI for the purpose of wielding or seizing power, likely by larger and more established actors.29&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Machines of Loving Grace, I discussed the possibility that authoritarian governments might use powerful AI to surveil or repress their citizens in ways that would be extremely difficult to reform or overthrow. Current autocracies are limited in how repressive they can be by the need to have humans carry out their orders, and humans often have limits in how inhumane they are willing to be. But AI-enabled autocracies would not have such limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worse yet, countries could also use their advantage in AI to gain power over other countries. If the “country of geniuses” as a whole was simply owned and controlled by a single (human) country’s military apparatus, and other countries did not have equivalent capabilities, it is hard to see how they could defend themselves: they would be outsmarted at every turn, similar to a war between humans and mice. Putting these two concerns together leads to the alarming possibility of a global totalitarian dictatorship. Obviously, it should be one of our highest priorities to prevent this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which AI could enable, entrench, or expand autocracy, but I’ll list a few that I’m most worried about. Note that some of these applications have legitimate defensive uses, and I am not necessarily arguing against them in absolute terms; I am nevertheless worried that they structurally tend to favor autocracies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully autonomous weapons. A swarm of millions or billions of fully automated armed drones, locally controlled by powerful AI and strategically coordinated across the world by an even more powerful AI, could be an unbeatable army, capable of both defeating any military in the world and suppressing dissent within a country by following around every citizen. Developments in the Russia-Ukraine War should alert us to the fact that drone warfare is already with us (though not fully autonomous yet, and a tiny fraction of what might be possible with powerful AI). R&amp;amp;D from powerful AI could make the drones of one country far superior to those of others, speed up their manufacture, make them more resistant to electronic attacks, improve their maneuvering, and so on. Of course, these weapons also have legitimate uses in the defense of democracy: they have been key to defending Ukraine and would likely be key to defending Taiwan. But they are a dangerous weapon to wield: we should worry about them in the hands of autocracies, but also worry that because they are so powerful, with so little accountability, there is a greatly increased risk of democratic governments turning them against their own people to seize power.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI surveillance. Sufficiently powerful AI could likely be used to compromise any computer system in the world,30 and could also use the access obtained in this way to read and make sense of all the world’s electronic communications (or even all the world’s in-person communications, if recording devices can be built or commandeered). It might be frighteningly plausible to simply generate a complete list of anyone who disagrees with the government on any number of issues, even if such disagreement isn’t explicit in anything they say or do. A powerful AI looking across billions of conversations from millions of people could gauge public sentiment, detect pockets of disloyalty forming, and stamp them out before they grow. This could lead to the imposition of a true panopticon on a scale that we don’t see today, even with the CCP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI propaganda. Today’s phenomena of “AI psychosis” and “AI girlfriends” suggest that even at their current level of intelligence, AI models can have a powerful psychological influence on people. Much more powerful versions of these models, that were much more embedded in and aware of people’s daily lives and could model and influence them over months or years, would likely be capable of essentially brainwashing many (most?) people into any desired ideology or attitude, and could be employed by an unscrupulous leader to ensure loyalty and suppress dissent, even in the face of a level of repression that most populations would rebel against. Today people worry a lot about, for example, the potential influence of TikTok as CCP propaganda directed at children. I worry about that too, but a personalized AI agent that gets to know you over years and uses its knowledge of you to shape all of your opinions would be dramatically more powerful than this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strategic decision-making. A country of geniuses in a datacenter could be used to advise a country, group, or individual on geopolitical strategy, what we might call a “virtual Bismarck.” It could optimize the three strategies above for seizing power, plus probably develop many others that I haven’t thought of (but that a country of geniuses could). Diplomacy, military strategy, R&amp;amp;D, economic strategy, and many other areas are all likely to be substantially increased in effectiveness by powerful AI. Many of these skills would be legitimately helpful for democracies—we want democracies to have access to the best strategies for defending themselves against autocracies—but the potential for misuse in anyone’s hands still remains.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having described what I am worried about, let’s move on to who. I am worried about entities who have the most access to AI, who are starting from a position of the most political power, or who have an existing history of repression. In order of severity, I am worried about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CCP. China is second only to the United States in AI capabilities, and is the country with the greatest likelihood of surpassing the United States in those capabilities. Their government is currently autocratic and operates a high-tech surveillance state. It has deployed AI-based surveillance already (including in the repression of Uyghurs), and is believed to employ algorithmic propaganda via TikTok (in addition to its many other international propaganda efforts). They have hands down the clearest path to the AI-enabled totalitarian nightmare I laid out above. It may even be the default outcome within China, as well as within other autocratic states to whom the CCP exports surveillance technology. I have written often about the threat of the CCP taking the lead in AI and the existential imperative to prevent them from doing so. This is why. To be clear, I am not singling out China out of animus to them in particular—they are simply the country that most combines AI prowess, an autocratic government, and a high-tech surveillance state. If anything, it is the Chinese people themselves who are most likely to suffer from the CCP’s AI-enabled repression, and they have no voice in the actions of their government. I greatly admire and respect the Chinese people and support the many brave dissidents within China and their struggle for freedom.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Democracies competitive in AI. As I wrote above, democracies have a legitimate interest in some AI-powered military and geopolitical tools, because democratic governments offer the best chance to counter the use of these tools by autocracies. Broadly, I am supportive of arming democracies with the tools needed to defeat autocracies in the age of AI—I simply don’t think there is any other way. But we cannot ignore the potential for abuse of these technologies by democratic governments themselves. Democracies normally have safeguards that prevent their military and intelligence apparatus from being turned inwards against their own population,31 but because AI tools require so few people to operate, there is potential for them to circumvent these safeguards and the norms that support them. It is also worth noting that some of these safeguards are already gradually eroding in some democracies. Thus, we should arm democracies with AI, but we should do so carefully and within limits: they are the immune system we need to fight autocracies, but like the immune system, there is some risk of them turning on us and becoming a threat themselves.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-democratic countries with large datacenters. Beyond China, most countries with less democratic governance are not leading AI players in the sense that they don’t have companies which produce frontier AI models. Thus they pose a fundamentally different and lesser risk than the CCP, which remains the primary concern (most are also less repressive, and the ones that are more repressive, like North Korea, have no significant AI industry at all). But some of these countries do have large datacenters (often as part of buildouts by companies operating in democracies), which can be used to run frontier AI at large scale (though this does not confer the ability to push the frontier). There is some amount of danger associated with this—these governments could in principle expropriate the datacenters and use the country of AIs within it for their own ends. I am less worried about this compared to countries like China that directly develop AI, but it’s a risk to keep in mind.32&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI companies. It is somewhat awkward to say this as the CEO of an AI company, but I think the next tier of risk is actually AI companies themselves. AI companies control large datacenters, train frontier models, have the greatest expertise on how to use those models, and in some cases have daily contact with and the possibility of influence over tens or hundreds of millions of users. The main thing they lack is the legitimacy and infrastructure of a state, so much of what would be needed to build the tools of an AI autocracy would be illegal for an AI company to do, or at least exceedingly suspicious. But some of it is not impossible: they could, for example, use their AI products to brainwash their massive consumer user base, and the public should be alert to the risk this represents. I think the governance of AI companies deserves a lot of scrutiny.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of possible arguments against the severity of these threats, and I wish I believed them, because AI-enabled authoritarianism terrifies me. It’s worth going through some of these arguments and responding to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, some people might put their faith in the nuclear deterrent, particularly to counter the use of AI autonomous weapons for military conquest. If someone threatens to use these weapons against you, you can always threaten a nuclear response back. My worry is that I’m not totally sure we can be confident in the nuclear deterrent against a country of geniuses in a datacenter: it is possible that powerful AI could devise ways to detect and strike nuclear submarines, conduct influence operations against the operators of nuclear weapons infrastructure, or use AI’s cyber capabilities to launch a cyberattack against satellites used to detect nuclear launches.33 Alternatively, it’s possible that taking over countries is feasible with only AI surveillance and AI propaganda, and never actually presents a clear moment where it’s obvious what is going on and where a nuclear response would be appropriate. Maybe these things aren’t feasible and the nuclear deterrent will still be effective, but it seems too high stakes to take a risk.34&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second possible objection is that there might be countermeasures we can take against these tools of autocracy. We can counter drones with our own drones, cyberdefense will improve along with cyberattack, there may be ways to immunize people against propaganda, etc. My response is that these defenses will only be possible with comparably powerful AI. If there isn’t some counterforce with a comparably smart and numerous country of geniuses in a datacenter, it won’t be possible to match the quality or quantity of drones, for cyberdefense to outsmart cyberoffense, etc. So the question of countermeasures reduces to the question of a balance of power in powerful AI. Here, I am concerned about the recursive or self-reinforcing property of powerful AI (which I discussed at the beginning of this essay): that each generation of AI can be used to design and train the next generation of AI. This leads to a risk of a runaway advantage, where the current leader in powerful AI may be able to increase their lead and may be difficult to catch up with. We need to make sure it is not an authoritarian country that gets to this loop first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if a balance of power can be achieved, there is still risk that the world could be split up into autocratic spheres, as in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Even if several competing powers each have their powerful AI models, and none can overpower the others, each power could still internally repress their own population, and would be very difficult to overthrow (since the populations don’t have powerful AI to defend themselves). It is thus important to prevent AI-enabled autocracy even if it doesn’t lead to a single country taking over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Defenses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we defend against this wide range of autocratic tools and potential threat actors? As in the previous sections, there are several things I think we can do. First, we should absolutely not be selling chips, chip-making tools, or datacenters to the CCP. Chips and chip-making tools are the single greatest bottleneck to powerful AI, and blocking them is a simple but extremely effective measure, perhaps the most important single action we can take. It makes no sense to sell the CCP the tools with which to build an AI totalitarian state and possibly conquer us militarily. A number of complicated arguments are made to justify such sales, such as the idea that “spreading our tech stack around the world” allows “America to win” in some general, unspecified economic battle. In my view, this is like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is “winning.” China is several years behind the US in their ability to produce frontier chips in quantity, and the critical period for building the country of geniuses in a datacenter is very likely to be within those next several years.35 There is no reason to give a giant boost to their AI industry during this critical period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, it makes sense to use AI to empower democracies to resist autocracies. This is the reason Anthropic considers it important to provide AI to the intelligence and defense communities in the US and its democratic allies. Defending democracies that are under attack, such as Ukraine and (via cyber attacks) Taiwan, seems especially high priority, as does empowering democracies to use their intelligence services to disrupt and degrade autocracies from the inside. At some level the only way to respond to autocratic threats is to match and outclass them militarily. A coalition of the US and its democratic allies, if it achieved predominance in powerful AI, would be in a position to not only defend itself against autocracies, but contain them and limit their AI totalitarian abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, we need to draw a hard line against AI abuses within democracies. There need to be limits to what we allow our governments to do with AI, so that they don’t seize power or repress their own people. The formulation I have come up with is that we should use AI for national defense in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where should the line be drawn? In the list at the beginning of this section, two items—using AI for domestic mass surveillance and mass propaganda—seem to me like bright red lines and entirely illegitimate. Some might argue that there’s no need to do anything (at least in the US), since domestic mass surveillance is already illegal under the Fourth Amendment. But the rapid progress of AI may create situations that our existing legal frameworks are not well designed to deal with. For example, it would likely not be unconstitutional for the US government to conduct massively scaled recordings of all public conversations (e.g., things people say to each other on a street corner), and previously it would have been difficult to sort through this volume of information, but with AI it could all be transcribed, interpreted, and triangulated to create a picture of the attitude and loyalties of many or most citizens. I would support civil liberties-focused legislation (or maybe even a constitutional amendment) that imposes stronger guardrails against AI-powered abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other two items—fully autonomous weapons and AI for strategic decision-making—are harder lines to draw since they have legitimate uses in defending democracy, while also being prone to abuse. Here I think what is warranted is extreme care and scrutiny combined with guardrails to prevent abuses. My main fear is having too small a number of “fingers on the button,” such that one or a handful of people could essentially operate a drone army without needing any other humans to cooperate to carry out their orders. As AI systems get more powerful, we may need to have more direct and immediate oversight mechanisms to ensure they are not misused, perhaps involving branches of government other than the executive. I think we should approach fully autonomous weapons in particular with great caution,36 and not rush into their use without proper safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, after drawing a hard line against AI abuses in democracies, we should use that precedent to create an international taboo against the worst abuses of powerful AI. I recognize that the current political winds have turned against international cooperation and international norms, but this is a case where we sorely need them. The world needs to understand the dark potential of powerful AI in the hands of autocrats, and to recognize that certain uses of AI amount to an attempt to permanently steal their freedom and impose a totalitarian state from which they can’t escape. I would even argue that in some cases, large-scale surveillance with powerful AI, mass propaganda with powerful AI, and certain types of offensive uses of fully autonomous weapons should be considered crimes against humanity. More generally, a robust norm against AI-enabled totalitarianism and all its tools and instruments is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible to have an even stronger version of this position, which is that because the possibilities of AI-enabled totalitarianism are so dark, autocracy is simply not a form of government that people can accept in the post-powerful AI age. Just as feudalism became unworkable with the industrial revolution, the AI age could lead inevitably and logically to the conclusion that democracy (and, hopefully, democracy improved and reinvigorated by AI, as I discuss in Machines of Loving Grace) is the only viable form of government if humanity is to have a good future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth and finally, AI companies should be carefully watched, as should their connection to the government, which is necessary, but must have limits and boundaries. The sheer amount of capability embodied in powerful AI is such that ordinary corporate governance—which is designed to protect shareholders and prevent ordinary abuses such as fraud—is unlikely to be up to the task of governing AI companies. There may also be value in companies publicly committing to (perhaps even as part of corporate governance) not take certain actions, such as privately building or stockpiling military hardware, using large amounts of computing resources by single individuals in unaccountable ways, or using their AI products as propaganda to manipulate public opinion in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The danger here comes from many directions, and some directions are in tension with others. The only constant is that we must seek accountability, norms, and guardrails for everyone, even as we empower “good” actors to keep “bad” actors in check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Player piano&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Economic disruption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous three sections were essentially about security risks posed by powerful AI: risks from the AI itself, risks from misuse by individuals and small organizations and risks of misuse by states and large organizations. If we put aside security risks or assume they have been solved, the next question is economic. What will be the effect of this infusion of incredible “human” capital on the economy? Clearly, the most obvious effect will be to greatly increase economic growth. The pace of advances in scientific research, biomedical innovation, manufacturing, supply chains, the efficiency of the financial system, and much more are almost guaranteed to lead to a much faster rate of economic growth. In Machines of Loving Grace, I suggest that a 10–20% sustained annual GDP growth rate may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it should be clear that this is a double-edged sword: what are the economic prospects for most existing humans in such a world? New technologies often bring labor market shocks, and in the past humans have always recovered from them, but I am concerned that this is because these previous shocks affected only a small fraction of the full possible range of human abilities, leaving room for humans to expand to new tasks. AI will have effects that are much broader and occur much faster, and therefore I worry it will be much more challenging to make things work out well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Labor market disruption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two specific problems I am worried about: labor market displacement, and concentration of economic power. Let’s start with the first one. This is a topic that I warned about very publicly in 2025, where I predicted that AI could displace half of all entry-level white collar jobs in the next 1–5 years, even as it accelerates economic growth and scientific progress. This warning started a public debate about the topic. Many CEOs, technologists, and economists agreed with me, but others assumed I was falling prey to a “lump of labor” fallacy and didn’t know how labor markets worked, and some didn’t see the 1–5-year time range and thought I was claiming AI is displacing jobs right now (which I agree it is likely not). So it is worth going through in detail why I am worried about labor displacement, to clear up these misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a baseline, it’s useful to understand how labor markets normally respond to advances in technology. When a new technology comes along, it starts by making pieces of a given human job more efficient. For example, early in the Industrial Revolution, machines, such as upgraded plows, enabled human farmers to be more efficient at some aspects of the job. This improved the productivity of farmers, which increased their wages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the next step, some parts of the job of farming could be done entirely by machines, for example with the invention of the threshing machine or seed drill. In this phase, humans did a lower and lower fraction of the job, but the work they did complete became more and more leveraged because it is complementary to the work of machines, and their productivity continued to rise. As described by Jevons’ paradox, the wages of farmers and perhaps even the number of farmers continued to increase. Even when 90% of the job is being done by machines, humans can simply do 10x more of the 10% they still do, producing 10x as much output for the same amount of labor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, machines do everything or almost everything, as with modern combine harvesters, tractors, and other equipment. At this point farming as a form of human employment really does go into steep decline, and this potentially causes serious disruption in the short term, but because farming is just one of many useful activities that humans are able to do, people eventually switch to other jobs, such as operating factory machines. This is true even though farming accounted for a huge proportion of employment ex ante. 250 years ago, 90% of Americans lived on farms; in Europe, 50–60% of employment was agricultural. Now those percentages are in the low single digits in those places, because workers switched to industrial jobs (and later, knowledge work jobs). The economy can do what previously required most of the labor force with only 1–2% of it, freeing up the rest of the labor force to build an ever more advanced industrial society. There’s no fixed “lump of labor,” just an ever-expanding ability to do more and more with less and less. People’s wages rise in line with the GDP exponential and the economy maintains full employment once disruptions in the short term have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible things will go roughly the same way with AI, but I would bet pretty strongly against it. Here are some reasons I think AI is likely to be different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speed. The pace of progress in AI is much faster than for previous technological revolutions. For example, in the last 2 years, AI models went from barely being able to complete a single line of code, to writing all or almost all of the code for some people—including engineers at Anthropic.37 Soon, they may do the entire task of a software engineer end to end.38 It is hard for people to adapt to this pace of change, both to the changes in how a given job works and in the need to switch to new jobs. Even legendary programmers are increasingly describing themselves as “behind.” The pace may if anything continue to speed up, as AI coding models increasingly accelerate the task of AI development. To be clear, speed in itself does not mean labor markets and employment won’t eventually recover, it just implies the short-term transition will be unusually painful compared to past technologies, since humans and labor markets are slow to react and to equilibrate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cognitive breadth. As suggested by the phrase “country of geniuses in a datacenter,” AI will be capable of a very wide range of human cognitive abilities—perhaps all of them. This is very different from previous technologies like mechanized farming, transportation, or even computers.39 This will make it harder for people to switch easily from jobs that are displaced to similar jobs that they would be a good fit for. For example, the general intellectual abilities required for entry-level jobs in, say, finance, consulting, and law are fairly similar, even if the specific knowledge is quite different. A technology that disrupted only one of these three would allow employees to switch to the two other close substitutes (or for undergraduates to switch majors). But disrupting all three at once (along with many other similar jobs) may be harder for people to adapt to. Furthermore, it’s not just that most existing jobs will be disrupted. That part has happened before—recall that farming was a huge percentage of employment. But farmers could switch to the relatively similar work of operating factory machines, even though that work hadn’t been common before. By contrast, AI is increasingly matching the general cognitive profile of humans, which means it will also be good at the new jobs that would ordinarily be created in response to the old ones being automated. Another way to say it is that AI isn’t a substitute for specific human jobs but rather a general labor substitute for humans.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slicing by cognitive ability. Across a wide range of tasks, AI appears to be advancing from the bottom of the ability ladder to the top. For example, in coding our models have proceeded from the level of “a mediocre coder” to “a strong coder” to “a very strong coder.”40 We are now starting to see the same progression in white-collar work in general. We are thus at risk of a situation where, instead of affecting people with specific skills or in specific professions (who can adapt by retraining), AI is affecting people with certain intrinsic cognitive properties, namely lower intellectual ability (which is harder to change). It is not clear where these people will go or what they will do, and I am concerned that they could form an unemployed or very-low-wage “underclass.” To be clear, things somewhat like this have happened before—for example, computers and the internet are believed by some economists to represent “skill-biased technological change.” But this skill biasing was both not as extreme as what I expect to see with AI, and is believed to have contributed to an increase in wage inequality,41 so it is not exactly a reassuring precedent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ability to fill in the gaps. The way human jobs often adjust in the face of new technology is that there are many aspects to the job, and the new technology, even if it appears to directly replace humans, often has gaps in it. If someone invents a machine to make widgets, humans may still have to load raw material into the machine. Even if that takes only 1% as much effort as making the widgets manually, human workers can simply make 100x more widgets. But AI, in addition to being a rapidly advancing technology, is also a rapidly adapting technology. During every model release, AI companies carefully measure what the model is good at and what it isn’t, and customers also provide such information after the launch. Weaknesses can be addressed by collecting tasks that embody the current gap, and training on them for the next model. Early in generative AI, users noticed that AI systems had certain weaknesses (such as AI image models generating hands with the wrong number of fingers) and many assumed these weaknesses were inherent to the technology. If they were, it would limit job disruption. But pretty much every such weakness gets addressed quickly— often, within just a few months.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth addressing common points of skepticism. First, there is the argument that economic diffusion will be slow, such that even if the underlying technology is capable of doing most human labor, the actual application of it across the economy may be much slower (for example in industries that are far from the AI industry and slow to adopt). Slow diffusion of technology is definitely real—I talk to people from a wide variety of enterprises, and there are places where the adoption of AI will take years. That’s why my prediction for 50% of entry level white collar jobs being disrupted is 1–5 years, even though I suspect we’ll have powerful AI (which would be, technologically speaking, enough to do most or all jobs, not just entry level) in much less than 5 years. But diffusion effects merely buy us time. And I am not confident they will be as slow as people predict. Enterprise AI adoption is growing at rates much faster than any previous technology, largely on the pure strength of the technology itself. Also, even if traditional enterprises are slow to adopt new technology, startups will spring up to serve as “glue” and make the adoption easier. If that doesn’t work, the startups may simply disrupt the incumbents directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That could lead to a world where it isn’t so much that specific jobs are disrupted as it is that large enterprises are disrupted in general and replaced with much less labor-intensive startups. This could also lead to a world of “geographic inequality,” where an increasing fraction of the world’s wealth is concentrated in Silicon Valley, which becomes its own economy running at a different speed than the rest of the world and leaving it behind. All of these outcomes would be great for economic growth—but not so great for the labor market or those who are left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, some people say that human jobs will move to the physical world, which avoids the whole category of “cognitive labor” where AI is progressing so rapidly. I am not sure how safe this is, either. A lot of physical labor is already being done by machines (e.g., manufacturing) or will soon be done by machines (e.g., driving). Also, sufficiently powerful AI will be able to accelerate the development of robots, and then control those robots in the physical world. It may buy some time (which is a good thing), but I’m worried it won’t buy much. And even if the disruption was limited only to cognitive tasks, it would still be an unprecedentedly large and rapid disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, perhaps some tasks inherently require or greatly benefit from a human touch. I’m a little more uncertain about this one, but I’m still skeptical that it will be enough to offset the bulk of the impacts I described above. AI is already widely used for customer service. Many people report that it is easier to talk to AI about their personal problems than to talk to a therapist—that the AI is more patient. When my sister was struggling with medical problems during a pregnancy, she felt she wasn’t getting the answers or support she needed from her care providers, and she found Claude to have a better bedside manner (as well as succeeding better at diagnosing the problem). I’m sure there are some tasks for which a human touch really is important, but I’m not sure how many—and here we’re talking about finding work for nearly everyone in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, some may argue that comparative advantage will still protect humans. Under the law of comparative advantage, even if AI is better than humans at everything, any relative differences between the human and AI profile of skills creates a basis of trade and specialization between humans and AI. The problem is that if AIs are literally thousands of times more productive than humans, this logic starts to break down. Even tiny transaction costs could make it not worth it for AI to trade with humans. And human wages may be very low, even if they technically have something to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible all of these factors can be addressed—that the labor market is resilient enough to adapt to even such an enormous disruption. But even if it can eventually adapt, the factors above suggest that the short-term shock will be unprecedented in size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Defenses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can we do about this problem? I have several suggestions, some of which Anthropic is already doing. The first thing is simply to get accurate data about what is happening with job displacement in real time. When an economic change happens very quickly, it’s hard to get reliable data about what is happening, and without reliable data it is hard to design effective policies. For example, government data is currently lacking granular, high-frequency data on AI adoption across firms and industries. For the last year Anthropic has been operating and publicly releasing an Economic Index that shows use of our models almost in real time, broken down by industry, task, location, and even things like whether a task was being automated or conducted collaboratively. We also have an Economic Advisory Council to help us interpret this data and see what is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, AI companies have a choice in how they work with enterprises. The very inefficiency of traditional enterprises means that their rollout of AI can be very path dependent, and there is some room to choose a better path. Enterprises often have a choice between “cost savings” (doing the same thing with fewer people) and “innovation” (doing more with the same number of people). The market will inevitably produce both eventually, and any competitive AI company will have to serve some of both, but there may be some room to steer companies towards innovation when possible, and it may buy us some time. Anthropic is actively thinking about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, companies should think about how to take care of their employees. In the short term, being creative about ways to reassign employees within companies may be a promising way to stave off the need for layoffs. In the long term, in a world with enormous total wealth, in which many companies increase greatly in value due to increased productivity and capital concentration, it may be feasible to pay human employees even long after they are no longer providing economic value in the traditional sense. Anthropic is currently considering a range of possible pathways for our own employees that we will share in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, wealthy individuals have an obligation to help solve this problem. It is sad to me that many wealthy individuals (especially in the tech industry) have recently adopted a cynical and nihilistic attitude that philanthropy is inevitably fraudulent or useless. Both private philanthropy like the Gates Foundation and public programs like PEPFAR have saved tens of millions of lives in the developing world, and helped to create economic opportunity in the developed world. All of Anthropic’s co-founders have pledged to donate 80% of our wealth, and Anthropic’s staff have individually pledged to donate company shares worth billions at current prices—donations that the company has committed to matching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, while all the above private actions can be helpful, ultimately a macroeconomic problem this large will require government intervention. The natural policy response to an enormous economic pie coupled with high inequality (due to a lack of jobs, or poorly paid jobs, for many) is progressive taxation. The tax could be general or could be targeted against AI companies in particular. Obviously tax design is complicated, and there are many ways for it to go wrong. I don’t support poorly designed tax policies. I think the extreme levels of inequality predicted in this essay justify a more robust tax policy on basic moral grounds, but I can also make a pragmatic argument to the world’s billionaires that it’s in their interest to support a good version of it: if they don’t support a good version, they’ll inevitably get a bad version designed by a mob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think of all of the above interventions as ways to buy time. In the end AI will be able to do everything, and we need to grapple with that. It’s my hope that by that time, we can use AI itself to help us restructure markets in ways that work for everyone, and that the interventions above can get us through the transitional period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Economic concentration of power&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate from the problem of job displacement or economic inequality per se is the problem of economic concentration of power. Section 1 discussed the risk that humanity gets disempowered by AI, and Section 3 discussed the risk that citizens get disempowered by their governments by force or coercion. But another kind of disempowerment can occur if there is such a huge concentration of wealth that a small group of people effectively controls government policy with their influence, and ordinary citizens have no influence because they lack economic leverage. Democracy is ultimately backstopped by the idea that the population as a whole is necessary for the operation of the economy. If that economic leverage goes away, then the implicit social contract of democracy may stop working. Others have written about this, so I needn’t go into great detail about it here, but I agree with the concern, and I worry it is already starting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I am not opposed to people making a lot of money. There’s a strong argument that it incentivizes economic growth under normal conditions. I am sympathetic to concerns about impeding innovation by killing the golden goose that generates it. But in a scenario where GDP growth is 10–20% a year and AI is rapidly taking over the economy, yet single individuals hold appreciable fractions of the GDP, innovation is not the thing to worry about. The thing to worry about is a level of wealth concentration that will break society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most famous example of extreme concentration of wealth in US history is the Gilded Age, and the wealthiest industrialist of the Gilded Age was John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller’s wealth amounted to ~2% of the US GDP at the time.42 A similar fraction today would lead to a fortune of $600B, and the richest person in the world today (Elon Musk) already exceeds that, at roughly $700B. So we are already at historically unprecedented levels of wealth concentration, even before most of the economic impact of AI. I don’t think it is too much of a stretch (if we get a “country of geniuses”) to imagine AI companies, semiconductor companies, and perhaps downstream application companies generating ~$3T in revenue per year,43 being valued at ~$30T, and leading to personal fortunes well into the trillions. In that world, the debates we have about tax policy today simply won’t apply as we will be in a fundamentally different situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related to this, the coupling of this economic concentration of wealth with the political system already concerns me. AI datacenters already represent a substantial fraction of US economic growth,44 and are thus strongly tying together the financial interests of large tech companies (which are increasingly focused on either AI or AI infrastructure) and the political interests of the government in a way that can produce perverse incentives. We already see this through the reluctance of tech companies to criticize the US government, and the government’s support for extreme anti-regulatory policies on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Defenses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can be done about this? First, and most obviously, companies should simply choose not to be part of it. Anthropic has always strived to be a policy actor and not a political one, and to maintain our authentic views whatever the administration. We’ve spoken up in favor of sensible AI regulation and export controls that are in the public interest, even when these are at odds with government policy.45 Many people have told me that we should stop doing this, that it could lead to unfavorable treatment, but in the year we’ve been doing it, Anthropic’s valuation has increased by over 6x, an almost unprecedented jump at our commercial scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the AI industry needs a healthier relationship with government—one based on substantive policy engagement rather than political alignment. Our choice to engage on policy substance rather than politics is sometimes read as a tactical error or failure to “read the room” rather than a principled decision, and that framing concerns me. In a healthy democracy, companies should be able to advocate for good policy for its own sake. Related to this, a public backlash against AI is brewing: this could be a corrective, but it’s currently unfocused. Much of it targets issues that aren’t actually problems (like datacenter water usage) and proposes solutions (like datacenter bans or poorly designed wealth taxes) that wouldn’t address the real concerns. The underlying issue that deserves attention is ensuring that AI development remains accountable to the public interest, not captured by any particular political or commercial alliance, and it seems important to focus the public discussion there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the macroeconomic interventions I described earlier in this section, as well as a resurgence of private philanthropy, can help to balance the economic scales, addressing both the job displacement and concentration of economic power problems at once. We should look to the history of our country here: even in the Gilded Age, industrialists such as Rockefeller and Carnegie felt a strong obligation to society at large, a feeling that society had contributed enormously to their success and they needed to give back. That spirit seems to be increasingly missing today, and I think it is a large part of the way out of this economic dilemma. Those who are at the forefront of AI’s economic boom should be willing to give away both their wealth and their power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Black seas of infinity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Indirect effects&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This last section is a catchall for unknown unknowns, particularly things that could go wrong as an indirect result of positive advances in AI and the resulting acceleration of science and technology in general. Suppose we address all the risks described so far, and begin to reap the benefits of AI. We will likely get a “century of scientific and economic progress compressed into a decade,” and this will be hugely positive for the world, but we will then have to contend with the problems that arise from this rapid rate of progress, and those problems may come at us fast. We may also encounter other risks that occur indirectly as a consequence of AI progress and are hard to anticipate in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the nature of unknown unknowns it is impossible to make an exhaustive list, but I’ll list three possible concerns as illustrative examples for what we should be watching for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rapid advances in biology. If we do get a century of medical progress in a few years, it is possible that we will greatly increase the human lifespan, and there is a chance we also gain radical capabilities like the ability to increase human intelligence or radically modify human biology. Those would be big changes in what is possible, happening very quickly. They could be positive if responsibly done (which is my hope, as described in Machines of Loving Grace), but there is always a risk they go very wrong—for example, if efforts to make humans smarter also make them more unstable or power-seeking. There is also the issue of “uploads” or “whole brain emulation,” digital human minds instantiated in software, which might someday help humanity transcend its physical limitations, but which also carry risks I find disquieting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI changes human life in an unhealthy way. A world with billions of intelligences that are much smarter than humans at everything is going to be a very weird world to live in. Even if AI doesn’t actively aim to attack humans (Section 1), and isn’t explicitly used for oppression or control by states (Section 3), there is a lot that could go wrong short of this, via normal business incentives and nominally consensual transactions. We see early hints of this in the concerns about AI psychosis, AI driving people to suicide, and concerns about romantic relationships with AIs. As an example, could powerful AIs invent some new religion and convert millions of people to it? Could most people end up “addicted” in some way to AI interactions? Could people end up being “puppeted” by AI systems, where an AI essentially watches their every move and tells them exactly what to do and say at all times, leading to a “good” life but one that lacks freedom or any pride of accomplishment? It would not be hard to generate dozens of these scenarios if I sat down with the creator of Black Mirror and tried to brainstorm them. I think this points to the importance of things like improving Claude’s Constitution, over and above what is necessary for preventing the issues in Section 1. Making sure that AI models really have their users’ long-term interests at heart, in a way thoughtful people would endorse rather than in some subtly distorted way, seems critical.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Human purpose. This is related to the previous point, but it’s not so much about specific human interactions with AI systems as it is about how human life changes in general in a world with powerful AI. Will humans be able to find purpose and meaning in such a world? I think this is a matter of attitude: as I said in Machines of Loving Grace, I think human purpose does not depend on being the best in the world at something, and humans can find purpose even over very long periods of time through stories and projects that they love. We simply need to break the link between the generation of economic value and self-worth and meaning. But that is a transition society has to make, and there is always the risk we don’t handle it well.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My hope with all of these potential problems is that in a world with powerful AI that we trust not to kill us, that is not the tool of an oppressive government, and that is genuinely working on our behalf, we can use AI itself to anticipate and prevent these problems. But that is not guaranteed—like all of the other risks, it is something we have to handle with care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Humanity’s test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading this essay may give the impression that we are in a daunting situation. I certainly found it daunting to write, in contrast with Machines of Loving Grace, which felt like giving form and structure to surpassingly beautiful music that had been echoing in my head for years. And there is much about the situation that genuinely is hard. AI brings threats to humanity from multiple directions, and there is genuine tension between the different dangers, where mitigating some of them risks making others worse if we do not thread the needle extremely carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking time to carefully build AI systems so they do not autonomously threaten humanity is in genuine tension with the need for democratic nations to stay ahead of authoritarian nations and not be subjugated by them. But in turn, the same AI-enabled tools that are necessary to fight autocracies can, if taken too far, be turned inward to create tyranny in our own countries. AI-driven terrorism could kill millions through the misuse of biology, but an overreaction to this risk could lead us down the road to an autocratic surveillance state. The labor and economic concentration effects of AI, in addition to being grave problems in their own right, may force us to face the other problems in an environment of public anger and perhaps even civil unrest, rather than being able to call on the better angels of our nature. Above all, the sheer number of risks, including unknown ones, and the need to deal with all of them at once, creates an intimidating gauntlet that humanity must run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the last few years should make clear that the idea of stopping or even substantially slowing the technology is fundamentally untenable. The formula for building powerful AI systems is incredibly simple, so much so that it can almost be said to emerge spontaneously from the right combination of data and raw computation. Its creation was probably inevitable the instant humanity invented the transistor, or arguably even earlier when we first learned to control fire. If one company does not build it, others will do so nearly as fast. If all companies in democratic countries stopped or slowed development, by mutual agreement or regulatory decree, then authoritarian countries would simply keep going. Given the incredible economic and military value of the technology, together with the lack of any meaningful enforcement mechanism, I don’t see how we could possibly convince them to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do see a path to a slight moderation in AI development that is compatible with a realist view of geopolitics. That path involves slowing down the march of autocracies towards powerful AI for a few years by denying them the resources they need to build it,46 namely chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. This in turn gives democratic countries a buffer that they can “spend” on building powerful AI more carefully, with more attention to its risks, while still proceeding fast enough to comfortably beat the autocracies. The race between AI companies within democracies can then be handled under the umbrella of a common legal framework, via a mixture of industry standards and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has advocated very hard for this path, by pushing for chip export controls and judicious regulation of AI, but even these seemingly common-sense proposals have largely been rejected by policymakers in the United States (which is the country where it’s most important to have them). There is so much money to be made with AI—literally trillions of dollars per year—that even the simplest measures are finding it difficult to overcome the political economy inherent in AI. This is the trap: AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilization to impose any restraints on it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can imagine, as Sagan did in Contact, that this same story plays out on thousands of worlds. A species gains sentience, learns to use tools, begins the exponential ascent of technology, faces the crises of industrialization and nuclear weapons, and if it survives those, confronts the hardest and final challenge when it learns how to shape sand into machines that think. Whether we survive that test and go on to build the beautiful society described in Machines of Loving Grace, or succumb to slavery and destruction, will depend on our character and our determination as a species, our spirit and our soul.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the many obstacles, I believe humanity has the strength inside itself to pass this test. I am encouraged and inspired by the thousands of researchers who have devoted their careers to helping us understand and steer AI models, and to shaping the character and constitution of these models. I think there is now a good chance that those efforts bear fruit in time to matter. I am encouraged that at least some companies have stated they’ll pay meaningful commercial costs to block their models from contributing to the threat of bioterrorism. I am encouraged that a few brave people have resisted the prevailing political winds and passed legislation that puts the first early seeds of sensible guardrails on AI systems. I am encouraged that the public understands that AI carries risks and wants those risks addressed. I am encouraged by the indomitable spirit of freedom around the world and the determination to resist tyranny wherever it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we will need to step up our efforts if we want to succeed. The first step is for those closest to the technology to simply tell the truth about the situation humanity is in, which I have always tried to do; I’m doing so more explicitly and with greater urgency with this essay. The next step will be convincing the world’s thinkers, policymakers, companies, and citizens of the imminence and overriding importance of this issue—that it is worth expending thought and political capital on this in comparison to the thousands of other issues that dominate the news every day. Then there will be a time for courage, for enough people to buck the prevailing trends and stand on principle, even in the face of threats to their economic interests and personal safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The years in front of us will be impossibly hard, asking more of us than we think we can give. But in my time as a researcher, leader, and citizen, I have seen enough courage and nobility to believe that we can win—that when put in the darkest circumstances, humanity has a way of gathering, seemingly at the last minute, the strength and wisdom needed to prevail. We have no time to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Erik Brynjolfsson, Ben Buchanan, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, Allan Dafoe, Kevin Esvelt, Nick Beckstead, Richard Fontaine, Jim McClave, and very many of the staff at Anthropic for their helpful comments on drafts of this essay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is symmetric to a point I made in Machines of Loving Grace, where I started by saying that AI’s upsides shouldn’t be thought of in terms of a prophesy of salvation, and that it’s important to be concrete and grounded and to avoid grandiosity. Ultimately, prophesies of salvation and prophesies of doom are unhelpful for confronting the real world, for basically the same reasons.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s goal is to remain consistent through such changes. When talking about AI risks was politically popular, Anthropic cautiously advocated for a judicious and evidence-based approach to these risks. Now that talking about AI risks is politically unpopular, Anthropic continues to cautiously advocate for a judicious and evidence-based approach to these risks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Over time, I have gained increasing confidence in the trajectory of AI and the likelihood that it will surpass human ability across the board, but some uncertainty still remains.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Export controls for chips are a great example of this. They are simple and appear to mostly just work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And of course, the hunt for such evidence must be intellectually honest, such that it could also turn up evidence of a lack of danger. Transparency through model cards and other disclosures is an attempt at such an intellectually honest endeavor.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indeed, since writing Machines of Loving Grace in 2024, AI systems have become capable of doing tasks that take humans several hours, with METR recently assessing that Opus 4.5 can do about four human hours of work with 50% reliability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And to be clear, even if powerful AI is only 1–2 years away in a technical sense, many of its societal consequences, both positive and negative, may take a few years longer to occur. This is why I can simultaneously think that AI will disrupt 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs over 1–5 years, while also thinking we may have AI that is more capable than everyone in only 1–2 years.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is worth adding that the public (as compared to policymakers) does seem to be very concerned with AI risks. I think some of their focus is correct (i.e. AI job displacement), and some is misguided (such as concerns about water use of AI, which is not significant). This backlash gives me hope that a consensus around addressing risks is possible, but so far it has not yet been translated into policy changes, let alone effective or well-targeted policy changes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They can also, of course, manipulate (or simply pay) large numbers of humans into doing what they want in the physical world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I don’t think this is a straw man: it’s my understanding, for example, that Yann LeCun holds this position.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For example, see Section 5.5.2 (p. 63–66) of the Claude 4 system card.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are also a number of other assumptions inherent in the simple model, which I won’t discuss here. Broadly, they should make us less worried about the specific simple story of misaligned power-seeking, but also more worried about possible unpredictable behavior we haven’t anticipated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ender’s Game describes a version of this involving humans rather than AI.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For example, models may be told not to do various bad things, and also to obey humans, but may then observe that many humans do exactly those bad things! It’s not clear how this contradiction would resolve (and a well-designed constitution should encourage the model to handle these contradictions gracefully), but this type of dilemma is not so different from the supposedly “artificial” situations that we put AI models in during testing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incidentally, one consequence of the constitution being a natural-language document is that it is legible to the world, and that means it can be critiqued by anyone and compared to similar documents by other companies. It would be valuable to create a race to the top that not only encourages companies to release these documents, but encourages them to be good.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There’s even a hypothesis about a deep unifying principle connecting the character-based approach from Constitutional AI to results from interpretability and alignment science. According to the hypothesis, the fundamental mechanisms driving Claude originally arose as ways for it to simulate characters in pretraining, such as predicting what the characters in a novel would say. This would suggest that a useful way to think about the constitution is more like a character description that the model uses to instantiate a consistent persona. It would also help us explain the “I must be a bad person” results I mentioned above (because the model is trying to act as if it’s a coherent character—in this case a bad one), and would suggest that interpretability methods should be able to discover “psychological traits” within models. Our researchers are working on ways to test this hypothesis.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be clear, monitoring is done in a privacy-preserving way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even in our own experiments with what are essentially voluntarily imposed rules with our Responsible Scaling Policy, we have found over and over again that it’s very easy to end up being too rigid, by drawing lines that seem important ex ante but turn out to be silly in retrospect. It is just very easy to set rules about the wrong things when a technology is advancing rapidly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SB 53 and RAISE do not apply at all to companies with under $500M in annual revenue. They only apply to larger, more established companies like Anthropic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I originally read Joy’s essay 25 years ago, when it was written, and it had a profound impact on me. Then and now, I do see it as too pessimistic—I don’t think broad “relinquishment” of whole areas of technology, which Joy suggests, is the answer—but the issues it raises were surprisingly prescient, and Joy also writes with a deep sense of compassion and humanity that I admire.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We do have to worry about state actors, now and in the future, and I discuss that in the next section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is evidence that many terrorists are at least relatively well-educated, which might seem to contradict what I’m arguing here about a negative correlation between ability and motivation. But I think in actual fact they are compatible observations: if the ability threshold for a successful attack is high, then almost by definition those who currently succeed must have high ability, even if ability and motivation are negatively correlated. But in a world where the limitations on ability were removed (e.g., with future LLMs), I’d predict that a substantial population of people with the motivation to kill but lower ability would start to do so—just as we see for crimes that don’t require much ability (like school shootings).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aum Shinrikyo did try, however. The leader of Aum Shinrikyo, Seiichi Endo, had training in virology from Kyoto University, and attempted to produce both anthrax and ebola. However, as of 1995, even he lacked enough expertise and resources to succeed at this. The bar is now substantially lower, and LLMs could reduce it even further.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A bizarre phenomenon relating to mass murderers is that the style of murder they choose operates almost as a grotesque sort of fad. In the 1970s and 1980s, serial killers were very common, and new serial killers often copied the behavior of more established or famous serial killers. In the 1990s and 2000s, mass shootings became more common, while serial killers became less common. There is no technological change that triggered these patterns of behavior, it just appears that violent murderers were copying each others’ behavior and the “popular” thing to copy changed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Casual jailbreakers sometimes believe that they’ve compromised these classifiers when they get the model to output one specific piece of information, such as the genome sequence of a virus. But as I explained before, the threat model we are worried about involves step-by-step, interactive advice that extends over weeks or months about specific obscure steps in the bioweapons production process, and this is what our classifiers aim to defend against. (We often describe our research as looking for “universal” jailbreaks—ones that don’t just work in one specific or narrow context, but broadly open up the model’s behavior.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Though we will continue to invest in work to make our classifiers more efficient, and it may make sense for companies to share advances like these with one another.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Obviously, I do not think companies should have to disclose technical details about the specific steps in biological weapons production that they are blocking, and the transparency legislation that has been passed so far (SB 53 and RAISE) accounts for this issue.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Another related idea is “resilience markets” where the government encourages stockpiling of PPE, respirators, and other essential equipment needed to respond to a biological attack by promising ahead of time to pay a pre-agreed price for this equipment in an emergency. This incentivizes suppliers to stockpile such equipment without fear that the government will seize it without compensation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why am I more worried about large actors for seizing power, but small actors for causing destruction? Because the dynamics are different. Seizing power is about whether one actor can amass enough strength to overcome everyone else—thus we should worry about the most powerful actors and/or those closest to AI. Destruction, by contrast, can be wrought by those with little power if it is much harder to defend against than to cause. It is then a game of defending against the most numerous threats, which are likely to be smaller actors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This might sound like it is in tension with my point that attack and defense may be more balanced with cyberattacks than with bioweapons, but my worry here is that if a country’s AI is the most powerful in the world, then others will not be able to defend even if the technology itself has an intrinsic attack-defense balance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For example, in the United States this includes the fourth amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Also, to be clear, there are some arguments for building large datacenters in countries with varying governance structures, particularly if they are controlled by companies in democracies. Such buildouts could in principle help democracies compete better with the CCP, which is the greater threat. I also think such datacenters don’t pose much risk unless they are very large. But on balance, I think caution is warranted when placing very large datacenters in countries where institutional safeguards and rule-of-law protections are less well-established.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is, of course, also an argument for improving the security of the nuclear deterrent to make it more likely to be robust against powerful AI, and nuclear-armed democracies should do this. But we don’t know what a powerful AI will be capable of or which defenses, if any, will work against it, so we should not assume that these measures will necessarily solve the problem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is also the risk that even if the nuclear deterrent remains effective, an attacking country might decide to call our bluff—it’s unclear whether we’d be willing to use nuclear weapons to defend against a drone swarm even if the drone swarm has a substantial risk of conquering us. Drone swarms might be a new thing that is less severe than nuclear attacks but more severe than conventional attacks. Alternatively, differing assessments of the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent in the age of AI might alter the game theory of nuclear conflict in a destabilizing manner.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be clear, I would believe it is the right strategy not to sell chips to China, even if the timeline to powerful AI were substantially longer. We cannot get the Chinese “addicted” to American chips—they are determined to develop their native chip industry one way or another. It will take them many years to do so, and all we are doing by selling them chips is giving them a big boost during that time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be clear, most of what is being used in Ukraine and Taiwan today are not fully autonomous weapons. These are coming, but not here today.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our model card for Claude Opus 4.5, our most recent model, shows that Opus performs better on a performance engineering interview frequently given at Anthropic than any interviewee in the history of the company.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Writing all of the code” and “doing the task of a software engineer end to end” are very different things, because software engineers do much more than just write code, including testing, dealing with environments, files, and installation, managing cloud compute deployments, iterating on products, and much more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Computers are general in a sense, but are clearly incapable on their own of the vast majority of human cognitive abilities, even as they greatly exceed humans in a few areas (such as arithmetic). Of course, things built on top of computers, such as AI, are now capable of a wide range of cognitive abilities, which is what this essay is about.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be clear, AI models do not have precisely the same profile of strengths and weaknesses as humans. But they are also advancing fairly uniformly along every dimension, such that having a spiky or uneven profile may not ultimately matter.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Though there is debate among economists about this idea.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Personal wealth is a “stock,” while GDP is a “flow,” so this isn’t a claim that Rockefeller owned 2% of the economic value in the United States. But it’s harder to measure the total wealth of a nation than the GDP, and people’s individual incomes vary a lot per year, so it’s hard to make a ratio in the same units. The ratio of the largest personal fortune to GDP, while not comparing apples to apples, is nevertheless a perfectly reasonable benchmark for extreme wealth concentration.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The total value of labor across the economy is $60T/year, so $3T/year would correspond to 5% of this. That amount could be earned by a company that supplied labor for 20% of the cost of humans and had 25% market share, even if the demand for labor did not expand (which it almost certainly would due to the lower cost).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To be clear, I do not think actual AI productivity is yet responsible for a substantial fraction of US economic growth. Rather, I think the datacenter spending represents growth caused by anticipatory investment that amounts to the market expecting future AI-driven economic growth and investing accordingly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When we agree with the administration, we say so, and we look for points of agreement where mutually supported policies are genuinely good for the world. We are aiming to be honest brokers rather than backers or opponents of any given political party.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I don’t think anything more than a few years is possible: on longer timescales, they will build their own chips.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;JuiceSSH - Give me my pro features back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceSSH used to be the best SSH client available on Android until December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since then, the purchase made in 2019 is not recognized anymore, and the price went up by 20$. Some users complain in review that after buying it again, the application doesn't get activated. Support is unresponsive, this looks like an exit scam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is a way to make the application work again. This required jadx to understand smali, and will require you ApkTool and jarsigner, which is part of OpenJDK, and you that can install on Windows using &lt;code&gt;choco install openjdk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll also need a JuiceSSH apk, I downloaded one from PureAPK, but feel free to dump your own from your device using adb if you cannot find it. Make sure to verify the hash using virus total/sha256sum if downloading from internet, which should be &lt;code&gt;d1ee811bcd82f25aea0bdc568896d82017ee174d9c4631c123a9d9173c748232&lt;/code&gt; for the last version available, version 3.2.2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are powershell version of the command lines, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decompile&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to decompile the dex packed code from the apk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; "C:\Program Files\OpenJDK\jdk-25\bin\java.exe" -jar d juicessh.apk
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modify smali&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You then need to modify the smali of three files, which are detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;smali/com/sonelli/juicessh/models/User.smali&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this file, we'll patch the purchase validation and signature validation, done by the &lt;code&gt;public boolean H()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the original version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public boolean H() {
    try {
        String str = "";
        ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList();
        for (Purchase purchase : this.purchases) {
            if (!arrayList.contains(purchase.order)) {
                str = str + purchase.product + purchase.state;
                arrayList.add(purchase.order);
            }
        }
        return vg0.b(this.signature, this.sessionIdentifier + this.name + this.email + str + this.disabled.toString());
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return false;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which we'll simply change into&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public boolean H() {
    return true;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# virtual methods
.method public H()Z
    .locals 1

    const/4 v0, 0x1
    return v0
.end method&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;smali/com/sonelli/oi0.smali&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this one, we'll patch the &lt;code&gt;public static boolean d(Object obj)&lt;/code&gt; function, who calls the H() function we modified above, which now returns true, filters product matching JuiceSSH in purchases list, and check if it the purchase is valid. We'll simply make it return true in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the original version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static boolean d(Object obj) {
    if (!obj.getClass().getName().equals(User.class.getName())) {
        return false;
    }
    try {
        if (!((User) obj).H()) {
            return false;
        }
        ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList();
        for (Purchase purchase : ((User) obj).purchases) {
            if (purchase.product.equals(a())) {
                arrayList.add(purchase);
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(arrayList, new a());
        if (arrayList.size() &amp;gt; 0) {
            if (((Purchase) arrayList.get(arrayList.size() - 1)).state.intValue() == 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return false;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the patched one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static boolean d(Object obj) {
    return obj.getClass().getName().equals(User.class.getName());
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.method public static d(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z
    .locals 3

    # obj.getClass()
    invoke-virtual {p0}, Ljava/lang/Object;-&amp;gt;getClass()Ljava/lang/Class;
    move-result-object v0

    const/4 v0, 0x0
    return v0

    :cond_true
    const/4 v0, 0x1
    return v0
.end method&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;smali/com/sonelli/pi0.smali&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll patch the central part of the authentication, which is called each time a pro-feature is triggered to ensure user has valid license, the &lt;code&gt;public static void j(Context context, p pVar)&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the original version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static void j(Context context, p pVar) {
    User user;
    User user2;
    String strS = User.s(context);
    if (strS == null) {
        pVar.a(context.getString(R$string.authentication_failure));
        return;
    }
    if (strS.equals("New User")) {
        pVar.a("New User");
        return;
    }
    User user3 = b;
    if (user3 != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !user3.disabled.booleanValue()) {
        long jCurrentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis() - b.modified;
        DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString(System.currentTimeMillis() + (b.w() * 1000), System.currentTimeMillis(), 0L, 0);
        DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString(System.currentTimeMillis() + (3600000 - jCurrentTimeMillis), System.currentTimeMillis(), 0L, 0);
        if (b.w() &amp;lt;= 0) {
            gj0.b("API", "Cached user's API session has expired - refreshing session...");
            e(context, null, b.sessionIdentifier, pVar);
            return;
        }
        pVar.b(b);
        if (jCurrentTimeMillis &amp;lt;= 3600000 || context == null || (user2 = b) == null) {
            return;
        }
        e(context, null, user2.sessionIdentifier, null);
        return;
    }
    User userA = User.A(context);
    if (userA == null || userA.disabled.booleanValue() || !userA.H()) {
        e(context, null, null, pVar);
        return;
    }
    b = userA;
    if (userA.w() &amp;lt;= 0) {
        e(context, null, b.sessionIdentifier, pVar);
        return;
    }
    pVar.b(b);
    if (context == null || (user = b) == null) {
        return;
    }
    e(context, null, user.sessionIdentifier, null);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pVar.b()&lt;/code&gt; is the success callback we'll call while &lt;code&gt;e()&lt;/code&gt; is called in case of error. b is the globally stored user we'll have to set. To patch this, we'll simply craft a User with meaningless data, a session expire always in future, save the user in b, and call the success callback every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static void j(Context context, p pVar) {
    User user = new User();
    user.email = "myemail@google.com";
    user.name = "hello";
    user.given_name = "hello";
    user.sessionExpires = System.currentTimeMillis() + (86400000 * 365);
    user.sessionIdentifier = "";
    b = user;
    pVar.b(user);

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week saw the House of Lords pass a vote that would, if approved by the Government, introduce an amendment to the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill (CWSB) that aims to “prohibit the provision” of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to children (under 18s) in the UK. The goal is to stop children allegedly using VPNs to bypass age verification systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the details on the Conservative-led amendment (92) page: “This new clause would require the Secretary of State to take action to promote and protect children’s wellbeing, and to further support child protective measures in the Online Safety Act, by prohibiting the provision to children in the United Kingdom of VPN services which can facilitate evasion of OSA age-gating processes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amendment itself passed with 207 votes in favour and 159 against (here), with the majority of yes votes coming from the Conservative Party and the majority of the no votes coming from the Labour Party. Crucially, this suggests that the amendment, at least in its current form, is currently opposed by the party of Government and so may struggle to survive once the Bill is returned to the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for the government’s objection is that they’re separately consulting on some of these issues and have yet to reach a conclusion. The government have previously expressed that there are “no current plans to ban the use of VPNs“, although that doesn’t mean to say they won’t try to impose age-based restrictions on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amendment text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Clause 27&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;insert the following new Clause—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;“Action to prohibit the provision of VPN services to children in the United Kingdom&lt;p&gt;(1) Within 12 months of the day on which this Act is passed the Secretary of State must, for the purpose of furthering the protection and wellbeing of children, make regulations which prohibit the provision to UK children of a relevant VPN service (the “child VPN prohibition”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Regulations under subsection (1)—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(a) may make provision for the provider of a relevant VPN service to apply to any person seeking to access its service in or from the UK age assurance which is highly effective at correctly determining whether or not that person is a child;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(b) must apply the child VPN prohibition to the provider of any relevant VPN service which is, or is likely to be—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(i) offered or marketed to persons in the United Kingdom;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;(ii) provided to a significant number of persons;&lt;p&gt;(c) must make provision for the monitoring and effective enforcement of the child VPN prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) OFCOM may produce guidance for providers of relevant VPN services to assist them in complying with the child VPN prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (1) may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) For the purposes of this section—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;“child” means a person under the age of 18;&lt;lb/&gt;“consumer” means a person acting otherwise than in the course of a business;&lt;lb/&gt;“relevant VPN service” means a service of providing, in the course of a business, to a consumer, a virtual private network for accessing the internet;&lt;lb/&gt;“UK child” means any child who is in the United Kingdom.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The focus on children above does however ignore that it may be mostly adults driving VPN usage to bypass age verification. Many adults do not want to have to share their private personal or financial details with unknown and unregulated third-party age verification providers, particularly when those services are associated with porn peddlers. The infamous Ashley Madison hack showed just how dangerous such information could be in the wrong hands (blackmail and suicide etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regulator’s CEO, Dame Melanie Dawes, also revealed last year (here) that, “following the 25th July deadline we saw a spike in [VPN] use – with UK daily active users of VPN apps temporarily doubling to around 1.5 million. However, usage has since plateaued, and has now fallen back to around 1 million by the end of September“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is before we touch on the potentially far-reaching and unintended consequences of enforcing age verification on VPNs, which are also legitimate tools for businesses, journalists and to help protect people (security) when abroad or on public networks etc. Many such VPNs can be deeply integrated into modern protection and network optimisation systems, often acting seamlessly in the background, thus a blanket requirement risks being extraordinarily disruptive. But some politicians do understand this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lord Knight of Weymouth (Labour)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Children may also turn to VPNs, which would then undermine the child safety gains of the Online Safety Act. The VPN amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Nash, tries to address this, but age-gating VPNs may be extremely problematic. My phone uses a VPN, following a personal device cyber consultation offered by this Parliament. VPNs can make us more secure, and we should not rush to deprive children of that safety. A blunt, blanket ban—it is a struggle not to call it a Blunkett ban—would also deny young people the positives of some of the less addictive social media.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Young people will continue to want to connect with each other. They will want to share music, their photos and videos, and their creative content. I was of the mixtape generation, now replaced by the shareable playlist. Young entrepreneurs will want to market their products: will they have to use an adults account on an adult’s phone, and be exposed to the risks of adult content as a result?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I speak to young people in my capacity as president of Young Citizens, I am struck by how well informed they are. They find out what is going on in the world through social media. Is it right that we lower the voting age to 16 and simultaneously prevent access to news for 15 year-olds when we want them to become well informed?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The arguments for doing something urgent and meaningful about the dangers to children of social media are compelling, but so are the arguments for doing it in a more sophisticated way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality is that, whatever the government decides, children who go seeking access such systems and content will always find a way to circumvent any measures that are introduced – just as they always have done (e.g. people can create their own VPNs). Instead, it often ends up being the innocent and harmless online services and security systems that could be hurt the most by the sledgehammer approach to age-gated internet censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that we won’t be able to approve any comments on this news article that appear to directly promote specific VPN services, due to the risk that this could clash with the government’s recent warnings about such promotions (here).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Utter despair, these out of touch dinasours have not one clue. You can literally find porn sites within 10 seconds that don’t have age ckecks and so don’t need a VPN either. If it takes me that long kids will have no problem. There will always be sites that don’t enforce it, you can’t police the whole internet and that’s what they don’t get, it’s impossible. Education is the key, not placebo measures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No legitimate VPN is going to be able to comply with what is being asked without going against their principles. This is a VPN ban by proxy. And that’s before we discuss the incorrectly labelled “social media” ban for under 16s which is actually a user-to-user service ban for under 16s and has wide reaching consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Framework for Understanding the Erosion of Democratic Immigration Enforcement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard the comparisons. You probably have too. “This is just like Hitler.” “ICE is the modern Gestapo.” “They’re all Nazis.” And if you’re anything like me, your first instinct was to roll your eyes a bit—or a lot. These terms get thrown around so casually that they’ve started to lose their weight. The boy who cried wolf, but with historical atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing though: I couldn’t shake the question of why so many people were saying it. Not the terminally online folks who call everything fascism, but historians, genocide scholars, constitutional lawyers. People who study this stuff for a living were raising alarms. Were they all just being hysterical?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I did what any self-respecting person who’s genuinely concerned should do: I tried to understand it. Not to confirm what I already believed, and not to dismiss what made me uncomfortable. I read history. I tried to understand current events without the filter of cable news or social media hot takes. I learned the frameworks that scholars who spend their lives studying authoritarianism have developed to identify warning signs—early, while something can still be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I’m presenting here isn’t an argument that we’re living in Nazi Germany. We’re clearly not. What I found instead was something more unsettling in its own way: a systematic erosion of the very safeguards that distinguish us from those historical horrors. The question isn’t “are we there yet?”—it’s “are we moving in that direction, and how fast?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This analysis proceeds in three stages: First, establishing the baseline constitutional and statutory framework that theoretically constrains ICE. Second, applying scholarly warning signs frameworks—developed by people who’ve studied genocide and democratic collapse—to identify what escalation would look like. Third, documenting what’s actually happening right now, not as theoretical risks but as recorded events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not asking you to agree with me at the outset. I’m asking you to look at the evidence with me and draw your own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part I: The Question That Started This Inquiry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I’m going to be honest about where I started on this. When I first heard people comparing ICE to the Gestapo, my gut reaction was basically: “Oh come on.” It felt like the kind of thing people say when they’re angry but not thinking clearly—politically useful maybe, but analytically lazy. The structural differences seemed so obvious that the comparison felt almost insulting to historical reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what I thought I knew: ICE operates under constitutional constraints. Federal courts can review their actions. Detainees have rights—habeas corpus, due process, all the stuff that’s supposed to distinguish us from the authoritarian nightmares of the 20th century. Immigration violations are civil matters, not inherent criminality. The whole system is designed with checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gestapo? That was something else entirely. The 1936 Prussian Gestapo Law was explicit: “Orders in matters of the Secret State Police are not subject to the review of the administrative courts.” Read that again. This wasn’t weak oversight or underfunded enforcement of existing protections. It was the deliberate legal abolition of oversight. When the Prussian High Court ruled that Gestapo actions were beyond judicial review, the court wasn’t admitting failure—it was affirming that no reviewable rights existed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I felt pretty confident. Yeah, over 400 Holocaust scholars had signed an open letter in 2019 arguing that comparisons to early-stage Nazi practices could serve educational purposes. But the consensus seemed clear: comparing ICE to the fully operational Gestapo was historically inappropriate. The structural safeguards were just fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case closed, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Not the comparison itself, but a different question—one that made me a lot less comfortable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would have to happen for those structural distinctions to stop mattering?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not “are we the same as Nazi Germany?”—obviously we’re not. But what if the question isn’t about sameness? What if it’s about trajectory? What if the safeguards I was pointing to as proof of our difference were actively being dismantled while I was busy feeling smug about their existence?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That question wouldn’t leave me alone. So I started digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part II: The Warning Signs Framework&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem with waiting until things are “bad enough” to warrant concern: by that point, the window for prevention has usually closed. The whole point of studying historical atrocities isn’t to have a checklist for when to start panicking—it’s to identify the early warning signs that precede the point of no return.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two scholarly frameworks proved essential for this analysis. These aren’t talking points from political pundits. They’re diagnostic tools developed by people who have spent decades studying how societies slide into authoritarianism and genocide. Full documentation is available in Appendix B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gregory Stanton’s Ten Stages of Genocide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Gregory Stanton isn’t some guy with opinions on Twitter. He’s the founding president of Genocide Watch, drafted UN Security Council resolutions on genocide prevention, and was asked by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to review U.S. policy failures in Rwanda. He first presented this framework as a State Department briefing paper in 1996, drawing on his study of the Holocaust, Armenian Genocide, and Cambodian Genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His key insight—and this is critical—is that genocide is a process, not an event. It doesn’t appear out of nowhere. It develops through predictable stages, and at each stage, intervention is still possible. The stages aren’t strictly linear; they can occur simultaneously and reinforce each other. But they follow a recognizable pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ten stages are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Classification – Division of people into “us” and “them” based on ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symbolization – Names or symbols assigned to classifications (yellow stars, identity cards)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discrimination – The dominant group uses law and political power to deny rights to the target group&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dehumanization – Target group equated with animals, vermin, insects, or diseases—language that makes violence psychologically possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Organization – Genocide is always organized, often by the state through militias or special units&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Polarization – Extremists drive groups apart; moderates are silenced or eliminated first because they’re most capable of stopping escalation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Preparation – Plans made, euphemisms deployed (“ethnic cleansing,” “national security”), fear weaponized&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persecution – Victims identified, isolated, harassed; deportation, forced displacement, extrajudicial killings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extermination – Mass killing begins (called “extermination” because perpetrators don’t consider victims fully human)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Denial – Perpetrators destroy evidence, intimidate witnesses, blame victims&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few things stand out to me here. First, Stanton specifically notes that Stage 3—Discrimination—often begins with stripping citizenship rights: “The first step toward the genocide of Jews and Roma in Nazi Germany were the laws to strip them of their German citizenship.” Second, Stage 6 emphasizes that moderates from the perpetrator’s own group are targeted early, because they’re the ones most capable of stopping the process from within.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there’s his warning about timing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The main lesson is that preventive action must be done as soon as you know genocide is coming. Many people talk about early warning. But it has to be really early because it is too late once genocide is already underway. So genocide prevention must start when the processes that lead to genocide begin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t a call to wait and see. It’s the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Levitsky &amp;amp; Ziblatt’s Four Warning Signs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt are Harvard political scientists—Levitsky specializes in Latin American politics, Ziblatt in European democracy. Their 2018 book “How Democracies Die” won the Goldsmith Book Prize and became a New York Times bestseller. It’s not a partisan screed; it’s a comparative analysis of democratic breakdown across dozens of countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their core thesis challenges the Hollywood version of how democracies fail: “Since the end of the Cold War, most democratic breakdowns have been caused not by generals and soldiers but by elected governments themselves.” Think Chávez in Venezuela, Orbán in Hungary, Erdoğan in Turkey. The pattern is consistent—leaders who come to power through democratic means and then systematically dismantle the institutions that could constrain them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They identified four behavioral warning signs that appear consistently across cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rejection of democratic rules of the game – Not just violating norms, but actively undermining electoral legitimacy, endorsing extralegal means to power, or attempting to change constitutional rules to entrench control&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Denial of legitimacy to political opponents – Treating rivals not as competitors but as existential threats, criminals, or traitors. This isn’t normal political hardball; it’s delegitimizing the very concept of opposition&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Toleration or encouragement of violence – Ties to armed groups, encouraging supporters to engage in violence, refusing to condemn political violence, or rehabilitating violent actors&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Readiness to curtail civil liberties – Threatening legal action against critics, restricting protest rights, praising repressive measures elsewhere, attacking the press as “enemies of the people”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this framework useful is its behavioral focus. You don’t have to read minds or predict intentions. You just observe what leaders do and compare it against documented patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2025, Levitsky and Ziblatt published an updated analysis in Foreign Affairs. Their assessment was blunt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reversing the United States' slide into authoritarianism will require democracy's defenders to recognize the twin dangers of complacency and fatalism. On the one hand, underestimating the threat... enables authoritarianism by encouraging inaction. On the other hand, overestimating the impact... discourages the citizen actions required to defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A Note on Using These Frameworks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I apply these frameworks to current events, a word on methodology. Over 400 Holocaust scholars—including historians like Omer Bartov, Doris Bergen, and Timothy Snyder—signed an open letter in 2019 urging the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to retract its statement rejecting all analogies between the Holocaust and other events. Their argument: such a position is “far removed from mainstream scholarship” and would make “learning from the past almost impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distinction that matters is between comparison and equation. Comparison means analyzing similarities and differences to understand patterns. Equation means claiming events are identical. Holocaust historian Waitman Wade Beorn put it this way: “Genocides—and dictatorships—do not spring into existence” but begin with “authoritarianism, racism, ethnic myths and dehumanizing language. This is where Holocaust comparisons can and should be made.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not here to tell you we’re living in 1940s Germany. I’m here to apply frameworks developed by people who study this for a living and see what they reveal about where we are—and where we might be heading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part III: What I Found When I Looked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I took these frameworks and started looking at what’s actually happening. Not what pundits say is happening. Not what politicians claim. The documented record: court filings, government memos, investigative journalism, official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I found was not theoretical risk. It was documented reality. The structural safeguards I had identified as distinguishing democratic from authoritarian enforcement were actively failing—not in some hypothetical future, but right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full evidence documentation is available in Appendix C. What follows are the findings that stopped me cold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Habeas Corpus: The Core Distinction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember Part I, where I identified habeas corpus as the single most important structural difference between ICE and the Gestapo? The right to challenge detention before an independent court is the fundamental protection against arbitrary imprisonment. It’s the thing that makes everything else possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what I found: In May 2025, Stephen Miller confirmed on CNN that the administration is “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, citing Article I’s invasion exception. The President was reportedly “personally involved in discussions.” But the part that really got me was how Miller framed judicial independence—as contingent on favorable rulings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read that again. The White House is explicitly saying that whether they respect judicial independence depends on whether courts rule the way they want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: they haven’t needed to formally suspend habeas corpus. They’ve made it functionally inaccessible instead. Immigration detention reached 66,000 by December 2025—the highest ever recorded, a 75% increase. Discretionary releases dropped 87%. For every 1 person released pending a hearing, 14.3 were deported directly from custody. Detainees are transferred out of state so quickly that attorneys cannot file petitions in the arrest jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here’s the kicker: when detainees do manage to file habeas petitions, they win over 96% of the time. Federal judges ruled for detainees in more than 700 cases; only 8 were denied. Texas alone saw 675+ petitions in the first eleven months of 2025—more than the entire first Trump term. The legal merit is overwhelming. The problem isn’t that the courts aren’t ruling correctly. The problem is what happens after they rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Court Order Defiance: The Pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where things get genuinely alarming. Individual violations happen. Bureaucracies screw up. But what I found wasn’t isolated incidents—it was a systematic pattern of defying court orders, then facing no consequences for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chanthila Souvannarath: Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick issued a temporary restraining order explicitly prohibiting deportation because of substantial citizenship claims. ICE deported him to Laos anyway. The ACLU called it “a catastrophic failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Any López Belloza: A federal judge in Boston blocked her deportation. Within 24 hours, she was flown to Texas and deported to Honduras. ICE attorneys later admitted in court filings that they “violated the court order.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Congressional Access: In December 2025, a federal court affirmed that members of Congress have the right to access detention facilities. One day later, DHS Secretary Noem secretly signed a memo reinstating 7-day notice requirements. The day after that, Representatives Omar, Morrison, and Craig were blocked from a Minneapolis ICE facility. Democracy Forward’s Skye Perryman: “This administration is willing to defy both Congress and the courts.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chicago Consent Decree: On November 12, 2025, Judge Cummings ruled ICE violated the Fourth Amendment by using fake “warrants” to arrest 615 people. ICE arrested 47 more the next day using identical methods.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kilmar Abrego Garcia: After the Supreme Court unanimously ordered the government to facilitate his return from wrongful deportation to CECOT, the DOJ’s response was to charge him with human smuggling. Unsealed documents show DOJ called the prosecution “a top priority” after losing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern is consistent: courts rule, administration defies, then retaliates against those who invoked the courts in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Attack on Judicial Independence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just defying court orders. The machinery of judicial independence itself is being dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly 100 immigration judges were fired in 2025. San Francisco’s immigration court went from 21 judges to 5—a 76% reduction—despite 120,935 pending cases. Aurora, Colorado and Oakdale, Louisiana now have zero immigration judges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of those fired judges, Judge Pappas, spoke to journalist Radley Balko about what happened. His words stuck with me: “The courts are dead.” He described being terminated for “insisting on granting hearings for asylum seekers.” DOJ memos became “increasingly overbearing” starting January 20, 2025. “The firewall between DOJ and DHS quickly disappeared.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there’s the physical intimidation. Senator Durbin documented that judges received pizza deliveries to their homes ordered in the name of Daniel Anderl—the son of Judge Esther Salas, who was murdered in 2020. Chief Justice Roberts responded in his year-end report by invoking the Declaration of Independence’s complaint that King George “made Judges dependent on his Will alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is drawing parallels to colonial tyranny, that’s not hyperbole. That’s a sitting jurist telling you something is seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Targeting Expansion: Citizens and Legal Residents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This started as immigration enforcement. It’s not staying there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ProPublica documented more than 170 U.S. citizens held by immigration agents in the first nine months of 2025—almost all Latino. About 20 were held for more than a day without access to counsel. When confronted with this, DHS Secretary Noem flatly denied it: “There’s no American citizens have been arrested.” NPR’s fact-check: FALSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renee Nicole Good was a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and mother of three. On January 7, 2026, she was serving as a legal observer at an ICE enforcement action in Minneapolis. ICE Agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed her. Video shows the steering wheel of her car turning away when Ross fired three shots in approximately 700 milliseconds. Secretary Noem’s response was to call Good “a domestic terrorist.” Mayor Frey of Minneapolis: “That is bullshit.” Governor Walz proclaimed January 9 “Renee Good Day.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOJ declined to open a civil rights investigation into Good’s killing. Agent Ross faces no charges. Meanwhile, six prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s office resigned after being pressured to investigate Good’s widow for “ties to activist groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The denaturalization program has entered quota-driven territory. A December 2025 USCIS memo directed field offices to provide DOJ with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month. For context: the historical average was 11 cases per year. A former official called the targets “virtually impossible” to meet through legitimate means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Violence Normalization: Record Deaths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;32 people died in ICE custody in 2025—the highest number since 2004, more than the previous four years combined. December 2025 was the deadliest month on record. At least 5 more died in the first 15 days of January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55 years old, died at Fort Bliss on January 3, 2026. The preliminary classification: homicide by asphyxiation from neck and chest compression. An eyewitness reported he cried “I can’t breathe” while guards restrained him. DHS’s public response was to call him a “sex predator.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fort Bliss—now holding 2,700+ people, the largest ICE facility—sits on the site of a World War II Japanese internment camp. The ACLU’s December 2025 report documented beatings, sexual abuse by officers, medical neglect, and denial of counsel. One doctor for hundreds of detainees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to tell you what to think about that. But I am going to ask you to sit with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Documented Torture: CECOT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human Rights Watch’s November 2025 report is titled “You Have Arrived in Hell.” It documents what happened to 252 Venezuelans sent to El Salvador’s CECOT prison between March and April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;48.8% had pending asylum cases in the United States&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No evidence any were gang members&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systematic beatings upon arrival and throughout detention&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;24/7 lights, no mattresses, solitary confinement used as torture&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Independent Forensic Expert Group—medical experts who assess torture claims—confirmed injuries consistent with torture&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noah Bullock of Cristosal, a human rights organization working in El Salvador, put it plainly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The US government has not been linked to acts of systematic torture on this scale since Abu Ghraib.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;El Salvador has admitted to the UN that the United States maintains control over the Venezuelan prisoners. These are people the U.S. government sent there, to conditions the U.S. government knew or should have known constituted torture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part IV: Where We Stand&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have the frameworks and we have the evidence. The question is: what do they tell us when we put them together?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be careful here. The point of using scholarly frameworks isn’t to “prove” we’re living in Nazi Germany or that genocide is imminent. The point is to have a structured way of assessing where we are on a trajectory—and whether we should be concerned about where that trajectory leads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me walk through both frameworks against what I found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stanton’s Ten Stages: Where Are We?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, Stanton’s stages aren’t strictly linear. They can occur simultaneously and reinforce each other. The question isn’t “which stage are we at” but “which stages are we seeing evidence of?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stages 1-4 (Classification, Symbolization, Discrimination, Dehumanization): These are clearly present and have been for some time. “Illegals” as a noun rather than an adjective. “Invasion” to describe migration. “Animals.” “Poison the blood of our country.” This isn’t new—but it’s worth noting that dehumanizing language is Stage 4 of 10, and Stanton is explicit that this language makes violence psychologically possible for perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stage 5 (Organization): The infrastructure is expanding rapidly. 287(g) agreements—which deputize local law enforcement to act as immigration agents—expanded from 135 jurisdictions to over 1,300 in 2025. That’s nearly a 10x increase. 12,000 new enforcement officers hired. The largest detention facility in the country built on a former Japanese internment site. This isn’t ad hoc enforcement; it’s systematic capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stage 6 (Polarization): This is the stage where moderates are targeted—people from within the system who might otherwise slow or stop escalation. Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan, a state judge, was arrested and convicted of felony obstruction for allegedly helping a defendant exit through a jury door to avoid ICE. She faces up to five years in prison and has resigned. The DOJ memo threatening prosecution of state and local officials who resist. The firing of immigration judges who “insisted on granting hearings.” The resignation of prosecutors who refused to investigate a shooting victim’s widow. Moderates are being removed or intimidated into silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stage 7 (Preparation): Plans are being made and infrastructure put in place. Denaturalization quotas of 100-200 cases per month. Third-country deportation agreements with 58 nations—meaning people can be sent not to their home countries but to wherever will take them. Stephen Miller’s public discussion of suspending habeas corpus, framed as contingent on courts “doing the right thing.” The rescinding of sensitive locations policies. These are preparations for expanded action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stage 8 (Persecution): Victims are being identified, isolated, and subjected to escalating harm. Sensitive locations policy rescinded—schools, churches, hospitals are no longer protected. ICE used pepper spray and pepper balls against students at Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis; the district cancelled in-person classes until February. Green card applicants arrested during routine USCIS interviews. U.S. citizens detained without counsel. A legal observer shot and killed, then posthumously labeled a terrorist. Documented torture at CECOT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be clear: I am not claiming we are at Stage 9 (Extermination) or that mass killing is imminent. But Stanton’s entire point is that you don’t wait until Stage 9 to act. By then it’s too late. The stages I’m documenting—5 through 8—are exactly the stages where intervention is still possible but the window is closing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Levitsky &amp;amp; Ziblatt’s Warning Signs: The Scorecard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The four behavioral warning signs are designed to be observable. You don’t have to read minds or predict the future. You just look at what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Rejection of Democratic Rules of the Game&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is unambiguous. The administration has explicitly defied court orders—not quietly, not through bureaucratic delay, but openly. ICE deported people after judges explicitly prohibited it. The DOJ charged someone after the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against them. Stephen Miller has publicly conditioned respect for judicial independence on courts ruling favorably. DHS reinstated congressional access restrictions one day after a court affirmed those rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t playing hardball within the rules. It’s rejecting the rules themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Denial of Legitimacy to Political Opponents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renee Good was a legal observer—someone exercising First Amendment rights to witness government action. She was shot and killed, and the Secretary of Homeland Security called her “a domestic terrorist.” Not an accident. Not a tragedy. A terrorist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six prosecutors were pressured to investigate her widow’s “ties to activist groups.” An arrested observer reported an agent saying the shooting happened because “you guys gotta stop obstructing us, that’s why that lesbian bitch is dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Judge Dugan wasn’t just prosecuted—she was arrested by federal agents at the courthouse. Acting Director Lyons announced plans to “track” protest “ringleaders.” The message is clear: opposition isn’t just wrong, it’s illegitimate. Criminal. Dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Toleration or Encouragement of Violence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;32 deaths in custody in 2025—a record. At least one classified as homicide. DOJ declined to open a civil rights investigation into Good’s killing. Agent Ross faces no charges. No one has been held accountable for the deaths at Fort Bliss. No one has been held accountable for the documented torture at CECOT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When violence goes unpunished, it’s tolerated. When it’s tolerated, it’s encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Readiness to Curtail Civil Liberties&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal observers targeted. Press access restricted. FOIA rejections increased 8x—from 5,427 in September-December 2024 to 41,918 in the same period of 2025. A whistleblower reported being told to “disengage” from providing records and received the lowest performance rating. Congressional oversight circumvented. State officials threatened with prosecution. Protesters placed under surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All four warning signs are present. Not ambiguously. Not arguably. Documented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What This Means&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to tell you exactly what to conclude from this. But I will tell you what I concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both frameworks—developed independently, by different scholars, studying different phenomena—point in the same direction. We are not at the end of either progression. We are somewhere in the middle. And the trajectory is toward escalation, not de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question that remains is what, if anything, we do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion: The Question Is Not Comparison But Trajectory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started this because I was tired of empty rhetoric—people throwing around “Nazi” and “Gestapo” like they’re interchangeable with “thing I don’t like,” and other people dismissing legitimate concerns because the comparisons felt overheated. I wanted to know: is there actually cause for concern here, or is this partisan hysteria from people who spend too much time doomscrolling?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I did the work. I read the scholars who study this for a living. I applied their frameworks. I looked at the documented record—court filings, government memos, investigative journalism, official statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what I found: the structural safeguards that distinguish us from historical horrors are eroding. Not hypothetically. Not theoretically. Right now, in documented ways you can verify yourself. What I’ve presented here is only a smattering of the available evidence, and more of it compounds every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 2025 through January 2026. One fucking month:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Courts ruling against the administration at 96%+ rates—and being ignored&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Habeas corpus nominally intact but functionally inaccessible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immigration courts gutted through mass judicial firings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prosecutorial independence collapsed (six prosecutors resigned rather than investigate a murder victim’s widow)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Congressional oversight openly defied&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Legal observers shot, then labeled terrorists&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Documented torture of U.S. deportees, on a scale not seen since Abu Ghraib&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not saying ICE is the Gestapo. I am not saying this is Nazi Germany. I am saying we are on a trajectory, and that trajectory is accelerating. Gregory Stanton has spent his career studying how societies slide into genocide. His warning is explicit: preventive action must come early. By the time the comparison becomes exact, it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far and you’re still skeptical, good. Don’t take my word for it. Read the sources. Check the court documents. Look at what’s actually happening—not what anyone, including me, tells you is happening. If you find errors in my analysis, hit me up. I’d genuinely rather be wrong about this than right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you’re not willing to do that work—if you’re going to dismiss this without engaging with the evidence—then shut the fuck up. Your opinion is worthless. This isn’t a debate club exercise. People are dying in custody. People are being tortured. A woman was shot dead for bearing witness, and the government called her a terrorist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The boy who cried wolf is a cautionary tale about false alarms. But there’s another version of that story: the village that was so conditioned to ignore warnings that they didn’t notice when the wolf actually showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at the evidence. Draw your own conclusions. And if those conclusions match mine, then we have work to do—and the time to start is now.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;When AI 'builds a browser,' check the repo before believing the hype&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Autonomous agents may generate millions of lines of code, but shipping software is another matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opinion AI-integrated development environment (IDE) company Cursor recently implied it had built a working web browser almost entirely with its AI agents. I won't say they lied, but CEO Michael Truell certainly tweeted: "We built a browser with GPT-5.2 in Cursor."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He followed up with: "It's 3M+ lines of code across thousands of files. The rendering engine is from-scratch in Rust with HTML parsing, CSS cascade, layout, text shaping, paint, and a custom JS VM."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sounds impressive, doesn't it? He also added: "It *kind of* works," which is not the most ringing endorsement. Still, numerous news sources and social media chatterboxes ran with the news that AI built a web browser in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too bad it wasn't true. If you actually looked at Cursor engineer Wilson Lin's blog post about FastRender, the AI-created web browser, you won't see much boasting about a working web browser. Instead, there's a video of a web browser sort of working, and a much less positive note that "building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing about making such a software announcement on GitHub is that while the headlines are proclaiming another AI victory, developers have this nasty trick. They actually git the code and try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers quickly discovered the "browser" barely compiles, often does not run, and was heavily misrepresented in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a techie, the actual blog post about how they tried and didn't really succeed was much more interesting. Of course, that Cursor sicced hundreds of GPT-5.2-style agents which ran for a week to produce three million lines of new code, to produce, at best, a semi-functional web browser from scratch, doesn't make for a good headline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Perplexity, my AI chatbot of choice, this week‑long autonomous browser experiment consumed in the order of 10-20 trillion tokens and would have cost several million dollars at then‑current list prices for frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd just cloned a copy of Chromium myself, and for all that time and money, independent developers who cloned the repo reported that the codebase is very far from a functional browser. Recent commits do not compile cleanly, GitHub Actions runs on &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; are failing, and reviewers could not find a single recent commit that was built without errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where builds succeeded after manual patching, performance was abysmal, with reports of pages taking around a minute to load and a heavy reliance on existing projects like Servo, a Rust-based web rendering engine, and QuickJS, a JavaScript engine, despite "from scratch" claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lin defended the project on Y Combinator, saying, for instance: "The JS engine used a custom JS VM being developed in vendor/ecma-rs as part of the browser, which is a copy of my personal JS parser project vendored to make it easier to commit to." If it's derived from his personal JavaScript parser, that's not really from scratch, is it? Nor is it, from the sound of the argument, written by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just because Linus Torvalds vibe codes doesn't mean it's a good idea&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Microsoft 365 Copilot app rebrand was bad, but there are far worse offenders&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The most durable tech is boring, old, and everywhere&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What the Linux desktop really needs to challenge Windows&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gregory Terzian, a Servo maintainer, responded: "The actual code is worse; I can only describe it as a tangle of spaghetti... I can't make much, if anything, out of it." He then gave the backhanded compliment: "So I agree this isn't just wiring up of dependencies, and neither is it copied from existing implementations: it's a uniquely bad design that could never support anything resembling a real-world web engine." Now that's a burn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From where I sit, what makes the Cursor case more dangerous than just a failed hack‑week project is that the hype is baked into its methodology. The "experiment" wasn't presented as what it really was: an interesting, but messy, internal learning exercise. No, it was rolled out as a milestone that conveniently confirmed the company's long‑running autonomous agent advertising. Missing from the story were basics any senior engineer would demand: passing Continuous Integration (CI), reproducible builds, and real benchmarks that show the browser doing more than limping through a hello-world page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zoom out, and CEOs are still predicting that AI will write 90 percent of code in a year, while most enterprise AI pilots still fail to deliver meaningful return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're now in a kind of AI uncanny valley for developers. Sure, tools like Cursor can be genuinely helpful as glorified autocomplete and refactoring assistants, but marketing keeps insisting junior engineers can take whole projects from spec to shipping. When you start believing your own sizzle reel, you stop doing the tedious validation work that separates a demo from a deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enough already. The hype has grown cold. Sarah Friar, OpenAI's CFO, recently blogged that in 2026, its focus would be on "practical adoption." Let's see real-world practical results first, and then we can talk about practical AI adoption. ®&lt;/p&gt;
