    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Regional Pricing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is the goal of every business to maximise profits. As a business, it is your responsibility to price your products in a way that will yield the most profit. Price your product too low and you risk missing out on a significant amount of profit. Price your product too high and it won't be affordable for many potential customers. To address this issue, businesses use profit maximization to settle on an optimal price, which is the point where profit is highest while balancing price and demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, consider that many businesses have customers from all around the world. To maximise global profits, a business needs to adjust its prices in different regions based on each country’s purchasing power and other factors like taxes, shipping, and tariffs. This is critical because a price that is affordable in one country may be too expensive in another. Without adjusting for these differences, a business could either underprice or overprice in certain markets, reducing profits in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many popular online services use regional pricing such as Netflix, Spotify, HBO Max, Disney+, YouTube Premium, Steam and Epic Games Store. In this article, I analyse the regional pricing strategy used by the popular online chess platform, Chess.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chess.com Premium Membership&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chess.com offers several premium membership plans. There are standard monthly plans (Gold, Platinum, and Diamond) as well as cost-effective yearly plans (Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Family). These plans give your account access to several premium-only features such as unlimited Puzzles, Game Reviews, and Insights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 7 total SKUs (distinct product plans) that Chess.com is currently selling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;gold_monthly_032022&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;platinum_monthly_032022&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;diamond_monthly_032022&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;gold_yearly_032022&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;platinum_yearly_032022&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;diamond_yearly_032022&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;fnf6_diamond_yearly_022025&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fnf6_diamond_yearly_022025&lt;/code&gt; SKU is particularly interesting. It belongs to the Family &amp;amp; Friends plan which Chess.com released in May 2025. This plan allows 6 people in total (you and 5 others) to join the plan and receive Diamond-level membership perks. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike many other family plans, Chess.com allows you to invite members from anywhere in the world, not just those who live in the same household. However, in certain countries, you can only invite members who live in the same country as you. This restriction prevents users in low-price regions from adding members from higher-priced regions, which would reduce profits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the pricing I see when I access the membership page from my personal account in Australia:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which got me thinking, what do prices look like in other countries? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Retrieve Regional Pricing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Location, Location, Location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main piece of information Chess.com needs to show you a membership price is your physical location. They need to determine which country you are in. Some services use KYC (Know Your Customer) systems that require government ID checks, but these create friction and reduce conversions. I'm not exactly too keen on sending Chess.com a copy of my passport just so Coach David can tell me to Google en passant. Instead, Chess.com relies on a simpler method: your internet connection's IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your IP address is essentially a number assigned to you by your ISP or server provider that allows you to interface with other machines on the internet. An example of an IPv4 IP address is &lt;code&gt;198.51.100.1&lt;/code&gt;. Every IP address belongs to an IP block, which is assigned to ISPs by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) through regional registries. By looking up which ISP or organisation owns a block, it is often possible to determine the country associated with an IP. GeoIP databases, such as MaxMind, combine registry data, routing information, and other sources to provide a practical way to map IP addresses to countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Profile Country vs. Billing Country&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Chess.com, you can choose a country to display on your profile, which adds a small flag next to your name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, here is Magnus Carlsen’s Norwegian flag:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this country is your profile country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a separate, hidden billing country linked to your account, used solely for billing and membership pricing. This billing country cannot be manually set. It is automatically detected based on your IP address, account activity, and other identifying signals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Spoofing Your Location with a VPN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, enough talk, let's find out what the regional pricing is in a country where Chess is very popular like India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I attempt to change my profile country on my account to the target country. Unfortunately, this makes no difference to the pricing on the membership page because my billing country is established to be Australia on my account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I’ll try spoofing my location with a VPN to change my IP address so the site sees me as coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this doesn’t change the membership pricing because I’m logged into my Chess.com account. Therefore, my account's established billing country is used instead of my VPN location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I’ll open an Incognito browser session with no cookies, local storage, or other tracking data. I will also not log into any Chess.com account. I connect to the VPN and visit the membership page. Interestingly, for some countries, like Germany, the correct local pricing is shown in the local currency (EUR), but for others, such as India, a generic fallback price appears in a different currency, like Singapore dollars (SGD).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that just using a VPN isn’t enough to see the pricing for a specific country. You also need an account from that region. No worries! I created a new account in a new Incognito session with an Indian IP address. This meant that my billing country was now set to India. Now I can finally see the correct pricing information for India in Indian Rupees (INR):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fingerprinting Techniques&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage, I thought the job was done. I took a well-deserved break to bleed 200 Elo (33% of my overall Elo), before coming back later in the day to log into my Indian Chess.com account without a VPN to check the prices again. To my surprise, the membership page was now showing prices in my own currency, Australian Dollars (AUD)! No matter what I did, this account refused to show pricing in Indian Rupees (INR) again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What just happened here is amazing! One of the major challenges Chess.com faces is dealing with cheaters. As part of their anti-cheating system, they perform extensive fingerprinting on devices, browsers, and IP addresses. For example, consider a titled player who creates a secret alt account to cheat. If they reuse the same IP or send the same browser cookies to Chess.com, the two accounts will become linked. The site can then take disciplinary action against the cheater on both accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems Chess.com is also using this fingerprinting system to assign the billing country on an account. When I logged into my Indian Chess.com account without a VPN, I contaminated the account and Chess.com quickly assigned my older, established account’s billing country to the new account. This appears to be a sticky change because even a single visit from my Australian IP was enough to permanently update the billing country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another fascinating discovery is that while fresh accounts created using a VPN do show the correct pricing at first, they quickly become stale. It seems Chess.com may perform more extensive checks on an account’s IP address in the background to gain confidence in its location. After a few hours, these accounts appear to become stale and start showing pricing based on a fallback billing country, like the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chess.com uses these techniques to keep pricing data secret and prevent customers from subscribing to cheaper plans in other countries. Using a different region to get lower pricing is usually not illegal, but it violates the site's Terms of Service and can lead to account suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Scraping Regional Pricing Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was ready to build a scraper to retrieve Chess.com’s regional pricing for every country my VPN supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a prerequisite I manually created 126 Chess.com accounts, one for each country my VPN supported. Nobody tell Danny (Chess.com's Chief Chess Officer) I may have bent the single-account policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tedious but manageable approach was preferred because automating account creation would require bypassing Cloudflare bot detection and captchas, which felt like overkill. Since the accounts needed to be fresh and uncontaminated, I ran my scraping script shortly after creating them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Python-based scraping tool performs the following steps for each country my VPN supports:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connect to the country via VPN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Log into the pre-created Chess.com account using Playwright to handle the JavaScript login flow.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch and store all Chess.com cookies in a cookie jar.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call an endpoint to retrieve the localised pricing for every SKU using the authenticated account.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch the Friends &amp;amp; Family page HTML source to parse the &lt;code&gt;isCrossBorderEligible&lt;/code&gt;flag.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Store the pricing data in a structured JSON file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disconnect from the VPN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sleep for 45 seconds to avoid VPN session rate limiting.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the JSON data we fetched for India:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#13;

    }&amp;#13;
  },&amp;#13;
  "isCrossBorderEligible": false&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the price for each SKU in the local currency (&lt;code&gt;amountInCountryCurrency&lt;/code&gt;), as well as the nominal value in USD (&lt;code&gt;amountInUsd&lt;/code&gt;) using the &lt;code&gt;usdFxRate&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the &lt;code&gt;usdFxRate&lt;/code&gt; fluctuates daily with market rates. You can also see the &lt;code&gt;isCrossBorderEligible&lt;/code&gt; flag, which determines whether you can add members to your plan from outside your country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a time-lapse demo of the tool in action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It usually takes a few runs to fetch data for all countries because VPN connections can be flaky and Chess.com’s Cloudflare anti-bot measures sometimes trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Friends &amp;amp; Family: Cross-Border Eligibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the Friends &amp;amp; Family plan with SKU &lt;code&gt;fnf6_diamond_yearly_022025&lt;/code&gt;, we found that out of the 126 countries explored, 47 were cross-border eligible while 79 were not. Only countries with higher purchasing power and correspondingly higher premium membership prices have cross-border eligibility enabled. This prevents users from exploiting cheaper regions, like Nigeria, to share memberships with friends in high-price countries such as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;📦 SKU: &lt;code&gt;fnf6_diamond_yearly_022025&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;isCrossBorderEligible&lt;/code&gt;only)&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you’re after the best cross-border Friends &amp;amp; Family plan deal, it’s time to make some friends with the Kuwaitis!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Summary: People often over-engineer solutions, and it leads to them running into problems with their CSS. In this article, we'll take a look at the least amount of CSS that you need to make a decent looking page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fun part of making a website is that if you write your HTML and nothing else, you have a responsive website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, if you have images they can cause some overflow issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we can start things off by fixing that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible you have videos or SVGs that are also causing problems (less likely with SVGs though), so if you need, you can expand upon this a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;img,
svg,
video {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Improving the typography&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing we can do is change the font family since the default is never very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll just use a basic &lt;code&gt;system-ui&lt;/code&gt; for this example. It has pretty good support these days, and looks good on every system without having to worry about loading in any extra fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, the font-size is a little small as well, so we can bump it up, and the default line-height is always a bit tight, so anything within the 1.5 to 1.7 range should do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;body {
  font-family: System UI;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though not perfect, this is already a huge improvement over the regular defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding Dark Mode Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people love dark mode, so let’s enable it based on a user’s system preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can do this by using the &lt;code&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;html {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will set the user-agent-styles to either a light or dark theme, based on the users system preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d prefer, we can do this without CSS as well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html lang="en" color-scheme="light dark"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A small note on following the system preferences&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is really handy, it is a best practice to allow users to manually toggle the color-scheme as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people prefer a dark system theme, but light website themes, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Restraining Content Width&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Line-length is one of the most important things when it comes to the readability of text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We generally want to try and fall somewhere in the 45-90 characters per line range (for body text, not headlines).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the website more readable, we’ll limit the content width using a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; element and some CSS magic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;main {
  max-width: min(70ch, 100% - 4rem);
  margin-inline: auto;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; function here will pick whatever is smallest, either &lt;code&gt;70ch&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;100% - 4rem&lt;/code&gt;. Because we are inside a &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; function, we don’t need to use a &lt;code&gt;calc()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever the output from that min() function, the width is less than 100%, so the page will be stuck to the left side of the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then use margin-inline: auto to center it, as this acts on the margins on the inline axis, so in any horizontal writing modes, that means both the margin-left and margin-right are auto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might want to switch out the main selector for a .container or .wrapper so you can have more control over where you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with that, our final CSS file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;html {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

body {
  font-family: system-ui;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

img,
svg,
video {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}

main {
  max-width: min(70ch, 100% - 4rem);
  margin-inline: auto;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Build on top of this&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a quick start to get things off the ground, though it could be used for a very simple page as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the most part, though, you’ll probably want to build on top of this, but it should be able to act as a nice jumping off point!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deloitte will provide a partial refund to the federal government over a $440,000 report that contained several errors, after admitting it used generative artificial intelligence to help produce it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) confirmed Deloitte would repay the final instalment under its contract, which will be made public after the transaction is finalised. It comes as one Labor senator accused the consultancy firm of having a “human intelligence problem”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deloitte was commissioned by the department to review the targeted compliance framework and its IT system, used to automate penalties in the welfare system if mutual obligations weren’t met by jobseekers, in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up: AU Breaking News email&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subsequent report found widespread issues, including a lack of “traceability” between the rules of the framework and the legislation behind it, as well as “system defects”. It said an IT system was “driven by punitive assumptions of participant non-compliance”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was first published on 4 July. It was re-uploaded to the DEWR website on Friday, after the Australian Financial Review in August reported that multiple errors had been found, including nonexistent references and citations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;University of Sydney academic, Dr Christopher Rudge, who first highlighted the errors, said the report contained “hallucinations” where AI models may fill in gaps, misinterpret data, or try to guess answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Instead of just substituting one hallucinated fake reference for a new ‘real’ reference, they’ve substituted the fake hallucinated references and in the new version, there’s like five, six or seven or eight in their place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So what that suggests is that the original claim made in the body of the report wasn’t based on any one particular evidentiary source.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The updated review noted a “small number of corrections to references and footnotes”, but the department has said there have been no changes to the review’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Deloitte conducted the independent assurance review and has confirmed some footnotes and references were incorrect,” a spokesperson for the department said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The substance of the independent review is retained, and there are no changes to the recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the updated version of the report, Deloitte added reference to the use of generative AI in its appendix. It states that a part of the report “included the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT – 4o) based tool chain licensed by DEWR and hosted on DEWR’s Azure tenancy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deloitte did not state that artificial intelligence was the reason behind the errors in its original report. It also stood by the original findings of the review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The updates made in no way impact or affect the substantive content, findings and recommendations in the report,” it stated in the amended version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Deloitte said “the matter has been resolved directly with the client”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rudge said that, despite his criticism, he hesitates to say the whole report should be “regarded as illegitimate”, because the conclusions concur with other widespread evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who was on a senate inquiry into the integrity of consulting firms, said it looked like “AI is being left to do the heavy lifting”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Deloitte has a human intelligence problem. This would be laughable if it wasn’t so lamentable. A partial refund looks like a partial apology for substandard work,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Anyone looking to contract these firms should be asking exactly who is doing the work they are paying for, and having that expertise and no AI use verified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Perhaps instead of a big consulting firm, procurers would be better off signing up for a ChatGPT subscription.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AFR found several incorrect references in the original report, including nonexistent reports by professors at the University of Sydney and the Lund University in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper also reported a made-up reference to a court decision in a robodebt case, Deanna Amato v Commonwealth. Deloitte wrote in its final report that the update “amend[ed] the summary of the Amato proceeding which contained errors”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;'It Pays Like .6:' Ford CEO Says There Aren't Enough Mechanics. Then a Mechanic Responds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;After Ford's CEO talked about a mechanic shortage, a mechanic offered a reason why no one wants to work in the industry.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ford’s CEO recently said that there is a shortage of mechanics in the US. A mechanic says he knows exactly why it’s hard to find good help these days—and that car companies themselves may be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wiktor Ivanovko posted a video to his Facebook page. It starts with a clip of comments made by Ford CEO Jim Farley to Yahoo Finance about how a lack of skilled mechanics is impacting the auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This morning when I woke up, there were 6,000 bays in our dealerships," Farley says in the clip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yahoo Finance editor Brian Sozzi asks, "Why is there a shortage of these workers?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Well, it’s a complicated problem, but—" Farley says as the video cuts out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Response to Ford CEO's Skilled Workers Comments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly, Ivanovko thinks he’s got an idea why Ford is struggling to hire skilled mechanics. And it doesn’t have to do with lack of trained workers. It’s all about engineering and flat-rate pay for repairs under warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’ll have to do this oil pan gasket on this F-250,” Ivanovko says, mimicking a Ford dealership manager. “You’ll have to pull the cab off of the frame to do it. And it’s under warranty, so it pays like .6 [hours]. Why don’t you want to work for me?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FROM THE TRENDING NEWS DESK&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Viral bits from across the social media landscape&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our team of experts tracks what's trending so you don't have to—from viral videos to online debates that have everyone talking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates vary, but online consensus is that it will take at least a few hours to remove the cab of a truck, and upwards of an entire day. But if the warranty pays a flat rate of just 40 minutes for a repair that requires removing the cab first, the mechanic is essentially losing time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many self-identified mechanics who commented on Ivanovko’s post blamed the engineers who design vehicles for making them difficult to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Engineers should design them to be worked on. Not to speed up the assembly process,” wrote one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Is Ford Struggling to Hire Skilled Mechanics?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Ford has 6,000 open positions, Farley estimated that the overall economy needs another 400,000 mechanic technicians. He blamed the gap on decreased productivity over the past 20 years, the lack of glamour associated with the position, and excessive regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to MarketWatch, the automotive industry is indeed short nearly half a million mechanics. While Farley focused on public perception of working people as a primary driver of this shortage, analysts attributed it to a lack of mechanics graduating from school, a wave of retirements by older generations of mechanics, and the fact that new vehicles generally last longer than older ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mechanics on a Reddit thread posted to r/AutoMechanics earlier this year note the study and dedication needed to learn the trade, the long hours, and the physical aspect of the job. Add to that the fact that it’s more expensive than ever to run an auto body shop, and you’ve got a recipe for a shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there are signs this trend might be reversing, including an increased number of mechanic graduates entering the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Viewers React to Ivanovko’s Ford Response&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the comments, viewers reacted to Ivanovko’s retort to the Ford CEO. Many said his criticism is justified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Always been a strong believer that if you want to be an engineer, you should have to work in the trade for no less than two years,” wrote one viewer. “So they understand what it takes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And you have to buy all of your own tools to do it,” agreed a second viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third viewer added, “I’m not a mechanic, but maybe make vehicles that are less of a hassle to work on and this goes for all vehicle manufacturers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motor1 contacted Ivanovko via Instagram direct message for comment. We’ll update this if he responds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Mondrian introduction to functional optics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post I’d like to try to discuss what functional optics are, without going too much into why they are so cool, and you should use them, or how they are implemented1 and should be used with a specific language and library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I personally think that functional optics should be a really easy concept to grasp, but currently learning them is harder than it should be mostly due to library implementation details, quite obscure documentation and an exotic usage of weird symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I will introduce and use a graphical notation to illustrate the concepts we will discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Types and values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start introducing our graphical notation from its basic building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can represent a type with a simple coloured rectangle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A value for a given type will be represented as a horizontal line spanning the width of the rectangle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sums and products&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When considering algebraic data types, we have two ways of combining types, using products and sums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The product of two types &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is a new type, which we will denote by &lt;code&gt;A*B&lt;/code&gt;, whose values are composed of a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and a value of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. An example of a product type is a tuple like &lt;code&gt;(Int, String)&lt;/code&gt; where each value is pair composed of an integer and a string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graphically we can represent a product type as two side by side rectangles&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to values, we need to upgrade a little bit our graphical interpretation. Since a value in a product type is composed of values of its components, we will just represent it as piecewise horizontal line, composed by horizontal lines (possible at different heights) spanning its horizontal sub-rectangles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the sum of two types is represented by two rectangles one on top of the other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A value of a sum type is a horizontal line spanning the width of the whole rectangle. If it is a horizontal line in the top rectangle, it means that we are selecting the first type, and we’re using one of its values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it is a horizontal line in the bottom rectangle, it means that we are selecting the second type and one of its values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, for any algebraic data type, we can represent it as a sum of products by stacking a series of rectangles one on top of the other, each one potentially divided horizontally in multiple sub-rectangles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, we can continue to split any sub-rectangle horizontally or vertically (if you prefer a top-down point of view) or you can place two rectangles side by side or top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A value of such a type is a piecewise horizontal line which can not cross a horizontal division.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Optics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have this graphical representation to represent data types, we can use it to discuss various kinds of optics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, we can think of an optic as a way to select, given our graphical representation of a type, one (or more) rectangle inside a given rectangle representing a type. For example in the following picture we are selecting the rectangle with the red boundary inside the main rectangle representing a complex type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If call the main type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and the selected type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, we will denote the optic selecting &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Optic A B&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before going into inspecting the various kinds of optics, let’s try to see if can can already derive some properties of optics just by looking at their graphical representation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compositionality&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that we can notice is that optics compose really well. Suppose we have a type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; represented by the following diagram&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can first select a sub-rectangle identifying a type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;Optic A B&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting now with the type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; we can use an &lt;code&gt;Optic B C&lt;/code&gt; to select a type &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using now the &lt;code&gt;Optic A B&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Optic B C&lt;/code&gt; we just chose, we can compose them to obtain an &lt;code&gt;Optic A C&lt;/code&gt; which directly selects &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This optic composition operation is actually associative and has an identity element, turning optics into a Category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s now start to have a look at some specific families of optics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Iso&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest optic we can define for any type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is the one that we can obtain by selecting the whole rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With such a selection we can see that for any value of the outer type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, we actually have a value of the type identified by the red rectangle, which we will call &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that, given an &lt;code&gt;Iso A B&lt;/code&gt;, we can actually define a function &lt;code&gt;view :: A -&amp;gt; B&lt;/code&gt; that for any value of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; gives us a value of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in this special case also the converse holds! For any value of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is actually &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; itself, we have in fact a value of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. This gives rise to a function &lt;code&gt;review :: B -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact &lt;code&gt;review . view = id_A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;view . review = id_B&lt;/code&gt; giving rise to a proper isomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our graphical representation, a &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt; is a vertical slice of the main rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any vertical slice cuts out a piece out of any horizontal line. In other terms, given a value of the type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; represented by the main rectangle, we have a way to obtain a value of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; represented by our vertical slice. This means that also in this case we are able to define a function &lt;code&gt;view :: A -&amp;gt; B&lt;/code&gt; which allows us to focus from the main type to one of its component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s not possible with &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es as it was with &lt;code&gt;Iso&lt;/code&gt;s to build back a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; from a value of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, since a value of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is only a part of value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. What is actually possible, though, is to update only the part included in the red rectangle of a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. In other terms, given a &lt;code&gt;Lens A B&lt;/code&gt;, we can define a function &lt;code&gt;set :: B -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; which takes a value of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; and a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and updates the section of the latter identified by the &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a look at the graphical representations of the &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; functions, we can convince ourselves that the following properties hold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If we &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;a value and then we&lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt;it, we must get back what we put in:&lt;code&gt;view (set b a) == b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If we &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;what we get out of a&lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt;, nothing changes:&lt;code&gt;set (view a) a == a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setting a value twice is the same thing as setting it once: &lt;code&gt;set b (set b a) == set b a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, we can notice that composing two lenses with the operation described in the Compositionality section gives us back another lens. A vertical slice of a vertical slice is in fact still a vertical slice of the original rectangle. In other terms this means that &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es form a subcategory of the bigger category of &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Composing adequately &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt; we can also define a function &lt;code&gt;over :: (B -&amp;gt; B) -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;over f a = set (f $ view a) a&lt;/code&gt;. This means that if we have a function &lt;code&gt;f :: B -&amp;gt; B&lt;/code&gt; which can transform values of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, we can use our lens to extract a &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; from an &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt;, use &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to transform the result, and eventually use &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; to update the &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; part inside the original &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If vertical slices are &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es, it is only natural to wonder what are horizontal slices. They correspond to &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s, and they are the dual concept of &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es. Where a &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt; represents a component in a product type, a &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt; represents a component in a sum type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at values, we can notice that a value in the main type could either be a value of the inner type or it could be completely outside of it. This implies that, given a &lt;code&gt;Prism A B&lt;/code&gt;, we can define a function &lt;code&gt;preview :: A -&amp;gt; Maybe B&lt;/code&gt; which, given a value &lt;code&gt;a :: A&lt;/code&gt; returns a &lt;code&gt;Just b&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was inside the sub-rectangle identified by &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hard, since a &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt; constitutes a horizontal slice of the main rectangle, if we have a value of the sub-rectangle, we can always interpret it a value of the main rectangle. In other words, this means that for a &lt;code&gt;Prism A B&lt;/code&gt; we can always define a function &lt;code&gt;review :: B -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; constructing a value of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; from a value of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, having a look at the graphical representation we can convince ourselves that the following properties hold for &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If we preview through a &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;what we just built using the same&lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;, we will get a value back:&lt;code&gt;preview (review b) == Just b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If when we preview we get a &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;, then reviewing the result through the same&lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;will get us to the initial value:&lt;code&gt;preview s == Just a =&amp;gt; review a == s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a &lt;code&gt;Prism A B&lt;/code&gt; it is also possible to define a function &lt;code&gt;set :: B -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;set = flip $ const review&lt;/code&gt;. This means that, being able to construct an &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; from a &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, we are able to substitute a &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; inside an &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; just by discarding the initial &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and building a new one from &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. Graphically, we can interpret this as using the &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; value in the inner rectangle to build an &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; value, forgetting about the initial &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point we can also define another function &lt;code&gt;over :: (B -&amp;gt; B) -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; which allows us to update the &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; part inside an &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. We can define it as &lt;code&gt;over f a = maybe a review (f &amp;lt;$&amp;gt; preview a)&lt;/code&gt;. In words, we use &lt;code&gt;preview&lt;/code&gt; to get a &lt;code&gt;Maybe B&lt;/code&gt; and we map &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; over it to get another &lt;code&gt;Maybe B&lt;/code&gt;; if we have a value &lt;code&gt;Just b&lt;/code&gt;, then we can use it to construct an &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;review&lt;/code&gt;; on the other hand, if we ended up with a &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;, we just keep the initial &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. Graphically, we can interpret this as follows: if the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; value is inside the &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; sub-rectangle, we apply &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and then we use the result to build a new &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; value; if the value is not in &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, we just leave it alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the graphical interpretation, it’s easy to convince ourselves that the composition of two &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s is still a &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;, given that a horizontal slice of a horizontal slice is still a horizontal slice of the main rectangle. In other terms, also &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s form a subcategory of the category of &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Affine traversals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we discussed &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es and &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s, one natural question which might arise is what happens when we try to compose a &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the picture above we see a &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt; (the blue rectangle) composed with a &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt; (the red rectangle). What we get out of the composition is the lower right rectangle, which is neither a &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;, nor a &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;, with respect to the main rectangle. It’s just a single inner rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you think about it, every inner rectangle of the main rectangle could be obtained by composing &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es and &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt; identifying an inner rectangle is called an &lt;code&gt;AffineTraversal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combining the intuitions we had for &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es and &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s, it’s actually possible to define functions &lt;code&gt;set :: B -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;over :: (B -&amp;gt; B) -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; also for &lt;code&gt;AffineTraversal&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the graphical representation suggests us that also &lt;code&gt;AffineTraversal&lt;/code&gt;s for a subcategory of &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s, since a sub-rectangle of a sub-rectangle is actually a sub-rectangle of the initial one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why stop at one?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s that we discussed so far focus on a single sub-rectangle. But, if we want, we can consider also &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s which focus on multiple sub-rectangles at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will denote by &lt;code&gt;Traversal A B&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s which focus on multiple sub-rectangles of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; inside a main rectangle of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;Traversal&lt;/code&gt;s we can still define &lt;code&gt;set :: B -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; which replaces all the selected sub-rectangles of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, inside the main rectangle of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, with the same vale &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, to produce a new &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, we can define &lt;code&gt;over :: (B -&amp;gt; B) -&amp;gt; A -&amp;gt; A&lt;/code&gt; which applies a function to all the selected sub-rectangles of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, inside the main rectangle of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, to produce a new &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another relevant function which makes sense to consider for &lt;code&gt;Traversal&lt;/code&gt;s is &lt;code&gt;toListOf :: A -&amp;gt; [B]&lt;/code&gt;, which extracts all the values of the selected sub-rectangles of type &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; from the main rectangle of type &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, we can notice that &lt;code&gt;Traversal A B&lt;/code&gt; form a subcategory of &lt;code&gt;Optic A B&lt;/code&gt;, since a selection of sub-rectangles inside a selection 0f sub-rectangles is still a selection of sub-rectangles of the main rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The graphical representation we just introduced in this post provides us with a tool to navigate various kinds of &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s and their operations. I hope it can provide a concrete way to understand the basic ideas behind &lt;code&gt;Lens&lt;/code&gt;es, &lt;code&gt;Prism&lt;/code&gt;s and other &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s and make it easier to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a representation could also help to explore and shed some light on the mysterious world of &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s. One could try to search for other sub-categories in a graphical fashion and then ask what do they correspond to in other &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt; representation. For example, what is the sub-category of &lt;code&gt;Optics&lt;/code&gt; made by multiple horizontal slices? Or the one made by multiple vertical slices?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I need also to mention that such a representation is not able, as far as I can see, to fully represent the whole universe of &lt;code&gt;Optic&lt;/code&gt;s. For example, it’s hard to distinguish a &lt;code&gt;Traversal&lt;/code&gt; from a &lt;code&gt;Fold&lt;/code&gt;, or describe what &lt;code&gt;Grate&lt;/code&gt;s are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, I’m confident that describing and explaining optics in this graphical fashion could help people understand their beauty and usefulness! Thanks for reading up to here!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quantum properties on a human scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nobel Prize laureates in physics for 2025, John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis, used a series of experiments to demonstrate that the bizarre properties of the quantum world can be made concrete in a system big enough to be held in the hand. Their superconducting electrical system could tunnel from one state to another, as if it were passing straight through a wall. They also showed that the system absorbed and emitted energy in doses of specific sizes, just as predicted by quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A series of groundbreaking experiments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics describes properties that are significant on a scale that involves single particles. In quantum physics, these phenomena are called microscopic, even when they are much smaller than can be seen using an optical microscope. This contrasts with macroscopic phenomena, which consist of a large number of particles. For example, an everyday ball is built up of an astronomical amount of molecules and displays no quantum mechanical effects. We know that the ball will bounce back every time it is thrown at a wall. A single particle, however, will sometimes pass straight through an equivalent barrier in its microscopic world and appear on the other side. This quantum mechanical phenomenon is called tunnelling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics recognises experiments that demonstrated how quantum tunnelling can be observed on a macroscopic scale, involving many particles. In 1984 and 1985, John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis conducted a series of experiments at the University of California, Berkeley. They built an electrical circuit with two superconductors, components that can conduct a current without any electrical resistance. They separated these with a thin layer of material that did not conduct any current at all. In this experiment, they showed that they could control and investigate a phenomenon in which all the charged particles in the superconductor behave in unison, as if they are a single particle that fills the entire circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This particle-like system is trapped in a state in which current flows without any voltage – a state from which it does not have enough energy to escape. In the experiment, the system shows its quantum character by using tunnelling to escape the zero-voltage state, generating an electrical voltage. The laureates were also able to show that the system is quantised, which means it only absorbs or emits energy in specific amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tunnels and crossings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help them, the laureates had concepts and experimental tools that had been developed over decades. Together with the theory of relativity, quantum physics is the foundation of what has come to be called modern physics, and researchers have spent the last century exploring what it entails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individual particles’ ability to tunnel is well known. In 1928, the physicist George Gamow realised that tunnelling is the reason why some heavy atomic nuclei tend to decay in a particular manner. The interaction between the forces in the nucleus creates a barrier around it, holding in the particles it contains. However, despite this, a small piece of the atomic nucleus can sometimes split off, move outside the barrier and escape – leaving behind a nucleus that has been transformed into another element. Without tunnelling, this type of nuclear decay could not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tunnelling is a quantum mechanical process, which entails that chance plays a role. Some types of atomic nuclei have a tall, wide barrier, so it can take a long while for a piece of the nucleus to appear outside it, while other types decay more easily. If we only look at a single atom, we cannot predict when this will happen, but by watching the decay of a large number of nuclei of the same type, we can measure an expected time before tunnelling occurs. The most common way of describing this is through the concept of half-life, which is how long it takes for half the nuclei in a sample to decay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Physicists were quick to wonder whether it would be possible to investigate a type of tunnelling that involves more than one particle at a time. One approach to new types of experiments originated in a phenomenon that arises when some materials get extremely cold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an ordinary conductive material, current flows because there are electrons that are free to move through the entire material. In some materials, the individual electrons that push their way through the conductor may become organised, forming a synchronised dance that flows without any resistance. The material has become a superconductor and the electrons are joined together as pairs. These are called Cooper pairs, after Leon Cooper who, along with John Bardeen and Robert Schrieffer, provided a detailed description of how superconductors work (Nobel Prize in Physics 1972).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooper pairs behave completely differently to ordinary electrons. Electrons have a great deal of integrity and like to stay at a distance from each other – two electrons cannot be in the same place if they have the same properties. We can see this in an atom, for example, where the electrons divide themselves into different energy levels, called shells. However, when the electrons in a superconductor join up as pairs, they lose a bit of their individuality; while two separate electrons are always distinct, two Cooper pairs can be exactly the same. This means the Cooper pairs in a superconductor can be described as a single unit, one quantum mechanical system. In the language of quantum mechanics, they are then described as a single wave function. This wave function describes the probability of observing the system in a given state and with given properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If two superconductors are joined together with a thin insulating barrier between them, it creates a Josephson junction. This component is named after Brian Josephson, who performed quantum mechanical calculations for the junction. He discovered that interesting phenomena arise when the wave functions on each side of the junction are considered (Nobel Prize in Physics 1973). The Josephson junction rapidly found areas of application, including in precise measurements of fundamental physical constants and magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The construction also provided tools for exploring the fundamentals of quantum physics in a new way. One person who did so was Anthony Leggett (Nobel Prize in Physics 2003), whose theoretical work on macroscopic quantum tunnelling at a Josephson junction inspired new types of experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The research group starts its work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These subjects were a perfect match for John Clarke’s research interests. He was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the US, where he had moved after completing his doctoral degree at the University of Cambridge, UK, in 1968. At UC Berkeley he built up his research group and specialised in exploring a range of phenomena using superconductors and the Josephson junction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the mid-1980s, Michel Devoret had joined John Clarke’s research group as a postdoc, after receiving his doctorate in Paris. This group also included the doctoral student John Martinis. Together, they took on the challenge of demonstrating macroscopic quantum tunnelling. Vast amounts of care and precision were necessary to screen the experimental setup from all the interference that could affect it. They succeeded in refining and measuring all the properties of their electrical circuit, allowing them to understand it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To measure the quantum phenomena, they fed a weak current into the Josephson junction and measured the voltage, which is related to the electrical resistance in the circuit. The voltage over the Josephson junction was initially zero, as expected. This is because the wave function for the system is enclosed in a state that does not allow a voltage to arise. Then they studied how long it took for the system to tunnel out of this state, causing a voltage. Because quantum mechanics entails an element of chance, they took numerous measurements and plotted their results as graphs, from which they could read the duration of the zero-voltage state. This is similar to how measurements of the half-lives of atomic nuclei are based on statistics of numerous instances of decay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tunnelling demonstrates how the experimental setup’s Cooper pairs, in their synchronised dance, behave like a single giant particle. The researchers obtained further confirmation of this when they saw that the system had quantised energy levels. Quantum mechanics was named after the observation that the energy in microscopic processes is divided into separate packages, quanta. The laureates introduced microwaves of varying wavelengths into the zero-voltage state. Some of these were absorbed, and the system then moved to a higher energy level. This showed that the zero-voltage state had a shorter duration when the system contained more energy – which is exactly what quantum mechanics predicts. A microscopic particle shut behind a barrier functions in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Practical and theoretical benefit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This experiment has consequences for the understanding of quantum mechanics. Other types of quantum mechanical effects that are demonstrated on the macroscopic scale are composed of many tiny individual pieces and their separate quantum properties. The microscopic components are then combined to cause macroscopic phenomena such as lasers, superconductors and superfluid liquids. However, this experiment instead created a macroscopic effect – a measurable voltage – from a state that is in itself macroscopic, in the form of a common wave function for vast numbers of particles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Theorists like Anthony Leggett have compared the laureates’ macroscopic quantum system with Erwin Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment featuring a cat in a box, where the cat would be both alive and dead if we did not look inside. (Erwin Schrödinger received the Nobel Prize in Physics 1933.) The intention of his thought experiment was to show the absurdity of this situation, because the special properties of quantum mechanics are often erased at a macroscopic scale. The quantum properties of an entire cat cannot be demonstrated in a laboratory experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Legget has argued that the series of experiments conducted by John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis showed that there are phenomena that involve vast numbers of particles which together behave just as quantum mechanics predicts. The macroscopic system that consists of many Cooper pairs is still many orders of magnitude smaller than a kitten – but because the experiment measures the quantum mechanical properties that apply to the system as a whole, for a quantum physicist it is fairly similar to Schrödinger’s imaginary cat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of macroscopic quantum state offers new potential for experiments using the phenomena that govern the microscopic world of particles. It can be regarded as a form of artificial atom on a large scale – an atom with cables and sockets that can be connected into new test set-ups or utilised in new quantum technology. For example, artificial atoms are used to simulate other quantum systems and aid in understanding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example is the quantum computer experiment subsequently performed by Martinis, in which he utilised exactly the energy quantisation that he and the other two laureates had demonstrated. He used a circuit with quantised states as information-bearing units – a quantum bit. The lowest energy state and the first step upward functioned as zero and one, respectively. Superconducting circuits are one of the techniques being explored in attempts to construct a future quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year’s laureates have thus contributed to both practical benefit in physics laboratories and to providing new information for the theoretical understanding of our physical world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tip: you will need to fill in at least the following: &lt;code&gt;LE_EMAIL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;APP_HOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DEPLOY_DOMAIN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EMAIL_SENDER_ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RESEND_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt; and your GitHub app settings (see [environment-variables] for details). &lt;code&gt;SERVER_IP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SECRET_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ENCRYPTION_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;POSTGRES_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; should be pre-filled. You can ignore all commented out environment variables.
5. Start services:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;scripts/prod/start.sh --migrate&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visit your URL: &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;APP_HOSTNAME&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The follwing commands must be run as &lt;code&gt;devpush&lt;/code&gt; user (&lt;code&gt;su - devpush&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, you can run an update with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;scripts/prod/update.sh --all&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can force a full upgrade (with downtime) using:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;scripts/prod/update.sh --full -y&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can update specific components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;scripts/prod/update.sh --components &amp;lt;component_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Development scripts target macOS for now.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install Colima and the Loki Docker plugin: &lt;quote&gt;scripts/dev/install.sh&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set up environment variables: &lt;quote&gt;cp .env.dev.example .env&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start the stack (streams logs): &lt;quote&gt;scripts/dev/start.sh&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;--prune&lt;/code&gt;to prune dangling images before build&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;--cache&lt;/code&gt;to use the build cache (default is no cache)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Initialize your database once containers are up: &lt;quote&gt;scripts/dev/db-migrate.sh&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the scripts section for more dev utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The app is mounted inside containers, so code changes reflect immediately. Some SSE endpoints may require closing browser tabs to trigger a reload.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The workers require a restart: &lt;quote&gt;docker-compose restart worker-arq&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To apply migrations: &lt;quote&gt;scripts/dev/db-migrate.sh&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You will need to configure a GitHub App with the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identifying and authorizing users: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Callback URL: add two callback URLs with your domain:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Expire user authorization tokens: No&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Post installation: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Setup URL: https://example.com/api/github/install/callback&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redirect on update: Yes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Webhook: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Active: Yes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Webhook URL: https://example.com/api/github/webhook&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Permissions: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Repository permissions &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Administration: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Checks: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Commit statuses: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Contents: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Deployments: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Issues: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Metadata: Read-only&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pull requests: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Webhook: Read and write&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Account permissions: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Email addresses: Read-only&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repository permissions &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Subscribe to events: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Installation target&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Push&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Repository&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide an access rules file to restrict who can sign up/sign in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Development: edit &lt;code&gt;./access.json&lt;/code&gt;. If missing, running&lt;code&gt;scripts/dev/start.sh&lt;/code&gt;will sed an allow‑all file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Production: edit &lt;code&gt;/srv/devpush/access.json&lt;/code&gt;on the server.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rules format (any/all may be used):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "emails": ["alice@example.com"],
  "domains": ["example.com"],
  "globs": ["*@corp.local", "*.dept.example.com"],
  "regex": ["^[^@]+@(eng|research)\\.example\\.com$"]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Globs use shell-style wildcards; regex are Python patterns. If the file is missing or empty, all valid emails are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you set the &lt;code&gt;ACCESS_DENIED_WEBHOOK&lt;/code&gt; environment variable, denied sign-in attempts will be posted to the provided URL with the following payload:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "provider": "google",
  "ip": "203.0.113.10",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0"

    &lt;p&gt;This repo aims to prove that something is wrong with APFS on macOS, but is also a good stress test in general when changing machine tooling that wants to oberve fs events (such as security tooling / EDR / virus scanners / etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gather Results&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Report / PR with your Results ❤️&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;have &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; @ &amp;gt;= 22.11
have &lt;code&gt;pnpm&lt;/code&gt; @ &amp;gt;= 10.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(if you have proto (with auto-install) or volta installed, these versions will be selected for you)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/disk-perf-git-and-pnpm.git
cd disk-perf-git-and-pnpm

pnpm install # Fill the cache so we don't hit the network during testing&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since you've installed all the dependencies already, we can start with the clean test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;time ( git clean -Xfd; git clean -fd )&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows Powershell:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(Measure-Command { git clean -Xfd; git clean -fd }).ToString()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then once that finishes, we can run the install test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;time ( pnpm install )&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows Powershell:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(Measure-Command { pnpm install }).ToString()&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;If using zsh&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A blog series recounting our adventures in the quest to port the BEAM JIT to the ARM32-bit architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work is made possible thanks to funding from the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation and the ongoing support of its Embedded Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Erlang ARM32 JIT is born!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week we finally achieved our first milestone in developing the ARM32 JIT. We executed our first Erlang function through JITted ARM32 machine code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    ~/arm32-jit$ qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf ./otp/RELEASE/erts-15.0/bin/beam.smp -S 1:1 -SDcpu 1:1 -SDio 1 -JDdump true -JMsingle     true -- -root /home/arm32-jit/otp/RELEASE -progname erl -home /home
    ~/arm32-jit$ echo $?
    42&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BEAM successfully runs and terminates with error code 42! That 42 comes from an Erlang function, just-in-time compiled by our ARM32 JIT!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Announcement is done! All code is available at https://github.com/stritzinger/otp/tree/arm32-jit&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep reading for a lot of interesting details!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first piece of Erlang code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-module(hello).
-export([start/2]).

start(_BootMod, _BootArgs) -&amp;gt;
    halt(42, [{flush, false}]).&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;code&gt;hello.erl&lt;/code&gt; that contains a &lt;code&gt;start/2&lt;/code&gt; function. The function head mimics the &lt;code&gt;erl_init:start/2&lt;/code&gt; function, which is the entry point of the first Erlang process. We replaced &lt;code&gt;erl_init:start/2&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;hello:start/2&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;erl_init.c&lt;/code&gt; module of the BEAM VM. This way, we forced the runtime to execute this Erlang function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hello:start/2&lt;/code&gt; is very simple as it just calls the &lt;code&gt;erlang:halt/2&lt;/code&gt;. This function is a BIF (Built-in Function) that executes C code, part of the BEAM VM. This code executes an ordered shutdown of the BEAM and allows us to customize the error code, in this case: &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Why &lt;code&gt;{flush, false}&lt;/code&gt;? At the time I am writing this, letting it be true causes a segmentation fault EHEH)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, we need to compile this Erlang module, but I will also generate the BEAM assembly so we can have a look at what we will have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{module, hello}.  %% version = 0
{exports, [{module_info,0},{module_info,1},{start,2}]}.
{attributes, []}.
{labels, 7}.

{function, start, 2, 2}.
  {label,1}.
    {line,[{location,"erts/preloaded/src/hello.erl",74}]}.
    {func_info,{atom,hello},{atom,start},2}.
  {label,2}.
    {move,{literal,[{flush,false}]},{x,1}}.
    {move,{integer,42},{x,0}}.
    {line,[{location,"erts/preloaded/src/hello.erl",76}]}.
    {call_ext_only,2,{extfunc,erlang,halt,2}}.

{function, module_info, 0, 4}.
  {label,3}.
    {line,[]}.
    {func_info,{atom,hello},{atom,module_info},0}.
  {label,4}.
    {move,{atom,hello},{x,0}}.
    {call_ext_only,1,{extfunc,erlang,get_module_info,1}}.

{function, module_info, 1, 6}.
  {label,5}.
    {line,[]}.
    {func_info,{atom,hello},{atom,module_info},1}.
  {label,6}.
    {move,{x,0},{x,1}}.
    {move,{atom,hello},{x,0}}.
    {call_ext_only,2,{extfunc,erlang,get_module_info,2}}.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can spot the start function and the two standard module_info functions that all Erlang modules have. We do not care much about those right now as we discovered that they are not executed and are not required to work, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that the core of the start function is just two &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; operations and one &lt;code&gt;call_ext_only&lt;/code&gt;. But bear in mind that the BEAM loader will transmute these Generic BEAM Operations into Specific operations. More complexity will pop up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are using &lt;code&gt;qemu-arm&lt;/code&gt; to emulate &lt;code&gt;Arm32&lt;/code&gt; and we are directly using &lt;code&gt;beam.smp&lt;/code&gt; to run the BEAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    ~/arm32-jit$ qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf ./otp/RELEASE/erts-15.0/bin/beam.smp -S 1:1 -SDcpu 1:1 -SDio 1 -JDdump true -JMsingle     true -- -root /home/vagrant/arm32-jit/otp/RELEASE -progname erl -home /home/vagrant&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JIT initialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At boot, the BEAM initializes the JIT if enabled. The JIT leverages the AsmJit library to emit all machine code instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Emission of all global shared fragments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 90+ code snippets that are shared among all modules. The JIT loads them one single time and sets up jumps to them in every other module. It is like a global library for all modules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We skipped most of these because just the shared fragments involved in the &lt;code&gt;hello:start/2&lt;/code&gt; execution were needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Emission of the erts_beamasm module&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of the JIT initialization, &lt;code&gt;erts_beamasm&lt;/code&gt; is emitted. This module is an internal hardcoded module that exists only when BEAM is using the JIT. It holds 7 fundamental instructions used to manage the Erlang process executions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;run_process - The main process execution entry point&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;normal_exit - Normal process termination&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;continue_exit - Continue after exit handling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;exception_trace - Exception tracing functionality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;return_trace - Return value tracing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;return_to_trace - Return to tracing state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;call_trace_return - Call tracing return handling&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Preloaded modules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;hello.erl&lt;/code&gt; module has been compiled and put as first and single Erlang module in the list of preloaded modules. Preloaded modules are Erlang fundamental modules that are always loaded by the BEAM before the first Erlang process can start. They implement, in Erlang, the core features of the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS). The OTP build scripts group all &lt;code&gt;ebin&lt;/code&gt; files into a single C header that is then linked into the executable. This makes the Erlang binaries available as a static C array in the BEAM source code. These are then loaded one by one after the BEAM VM is initialized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cool, let's nuke all these modules and leave just our &lt;code&gt;hello.erl&lt;/code&gt;. It does not need many BEAM instructions and we can easily verify that it executes. To do the substitution we just need to change this build variable in otp/erts/emulator/Makefile.in&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are running BEAMASM with &lt;code&gt;-JDdump true&lt;/code&gt; so &lt;code&gt;asmjit&lt;/code&gt; will dump all ARM32 assembly for each module! This is incredibly useful if monitored while executing with a debugger, as we can see the assembler being printed line by line by our code.&lt;/p&gt;

; CODE_SIZE: 632&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bear in mind, this assembler is not what hello should look like. We are missing a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can spot many sequences like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    movw r0, 64676
    movt r0, 16480
    blx L22 # &amp;lt;---- branch to NYI&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a call to &lt;code&gt;nyi&lt;/code&gt; (Not Yet Implemented) function and the argument loaded to R0 is the pointer to a string that contains the name of the BEAM instruction that should have been emitted instead. You can spot many of these since we are only emitting the code to reach halt. Everything after that is not important now as halt will never return!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many more comments we could make around all the details in this assembler dump, but let's move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Jumping into Jitted code!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later in the BEAM initialization the first Erlang process will be allocated and started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We swap the module and function with hello in erts/emulator/beam/erl_init.c&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    erl_spawn_system_process(&amp;amp;parent, am_hello, am_start, args, &amp;amp;so);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One BEAM scheduler thread will jump to the &lt;code&gt;process_main&lt;/code&gt; function. You can find it here in the source code. This is emitted by our JIT and is the first emitted code that will run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we need to handle the Erlang processes scheduling by calling BEAM routines that implement the algorithms of Erlang concurrency, like &lt;code&gt;erts_schedule&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;erts_schedule&lt;/code&gt; will return the pointer to the &lt;code&gt;Process&lt;/code&gt; C structure that holds all information about the process that is going to execute. We then load all necessary data inside registers and then we branch to the exact point where the program execution stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The first Erlang function call&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case we are calling &lt;code&gt;hello:start/2&lt;/code&gt; so the first instruction to execute is &lt;code&gt;apply_only&lt;/code&gt; that does a few things but ends up calling the C &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The routine processes the Module-Function-Arity information to get the address where the function code resides in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What follows is the Erlang function prologue. You can see it in the assembler code section above. For example, all functions have these instructions in their prologue:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i_breakpoint_trampoline: handle breakpoints for the &lt;code&gt;debugger&lt;/code&gt;app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i_test_yield: checks if the function should yield and go back to the scheduler&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have minimal or partial implementations of these since we do not really need them. We have to emit them though, as the C++ generated loader functions from the BEAM are expanding the Erlang function call Operation into a more specific and complex function prologue sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, we added support for the &lt;code&gt;call_light_bif&lt;/code&gt; operation that precedes the call to the halt_2 BIF routine. This implementation is also minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Question for later: did you notice that we put a &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; as a number in the code? Numeric constants are printed as decimals in the dump, but we cannot spot any 42!?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the call, we see two other operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dealloc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;return&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are just calls to NYI as we will never reach this code! So for now, we can skip them...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Let's roll the JIT!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    ~/arm32-jit$ qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf ./otp/RELEASE/erts-15.0/bin/beam.smp -S 1:1 -SDcpu 1:1 -SDio 1 -JDdump true -JMsingle     true -- -root /home/arm32-jit/otp/RELEASE -progname erl -home /home
    ~/arm32-jit$&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impressive, the program returns immediately without even saying "Hi" ... and without Segmentation Fault!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But let's check the program return code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;~/arm32-jit$ echo $?
42
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can safely say that number is not there by accident! This is a great achievement as from now on we will be able to incrementally add Erlang instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Erlang line we add will trigger new Opcodes. By emitting them and running the code we will have immediate feedback on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next goal now is to complete the &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; module to host all possible beam instructions!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Hey where is 42???&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One interesting thing I spotted looking at the assembly: You cannot find the number &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; in there. Or actually, you can, it is just hidden in plain sight. To understand you need to know how we are using ARM32 registers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular the register &lt;code&gt;r4&lt;/code&gt;, a callee-saved register. We are using it to store the pointer to the &lt;code&gt;ErtsSchedulerRegisters&lt;/code&gt; struct. The &lt;code&gt;ErtsSchedulerRegisters&lt;/code&gt; contains the X register array. When a function is called, X registers are used to store the arguments of the call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This becomes more obvious if we compare the Erlang assembly to the Arm32 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# i_move_sd                       &amp;lt;---- {move,{literal,[{flush,false}]},{x,1}}. % List at X[1]
    ldr r12, [L14]
    str r12, [r4, 68]
# i_move_sd                       &amp;lt;---- {move,{integer,42},{x,0}}. % 42 at X[0]
    movw r12, 687 
    str r12, [r4, 64]
# line_I
# allocate_tt
# call_light_bif_be
L15:
    ldr r3, [L16]
    movw r1, 10188
    movt r1, 16432
    adr r2, L15
# BIF: erlang:halt/2
# ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;42 is stored at &lt;code&gt;r4&lt;/code&gt;+64.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;r4: pointer to the &lt;code&gt;ErtsSchedulerRegisters&lt;/code&gt;struct&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64: base offset from the beginning of the struct to the beginning of the &lt;code&gt;x_reg_array&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list is stored at &lt;code&gt;r4&lt;/code&gt;+68.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;68: is the base offset + the size of one &lt;code&gt;Eterm&lt;/code&gt;(4 bytes on ARM32)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why in assembly do we see 687 and not 42?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Converting both numbers to hex we get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;42 -&amp;gt; 2A&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;687 -&amp;gt; 2AF !!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, this is an example of a Tagged Value. If we consult the BEAM book we can learn about the Tagging Scheme:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;00 11 Pid&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;01 11 Port&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10 11 Immediate 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;11 11 Small integer&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;42 is tagged with &lt;code&gt;1111&lt;/code&gt; at the low end. So the BEAM can quickly recognize during a pattern match that this Erlang Term is a Small Integer!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3M Might Just Escape Its Toxic Chemical Legacy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decades of selling PFAS left the iconic American manufacturer mired in legal liabilities. A new CEO is hoping to spark a turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Command strip is one of those quintessential 3M products. Released in 1996, it was simple yet revolutionary, strong enough to hold items without stripping paint when removed. Soon it was fastening framed photos, bathroom towels and outdoor decorations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The adhesive that made the strip possible was invented by a 3M scientist in the late 1980s. The exact science is a closely guarded secret, but it can resist gravity while somehow pulling away clean when tugged as instructed. In hindsight the market for such an invention is obvious, and yet it was almost lost to corporate bureaucracy. 3M shelved the project at one point in the ’90s and revived it only after impassioned pleas from a determined product development executive. His persistence paid off: Within three years of its debut, the Command strip was turning a $10 million profit. 3M Co. now sells more than 200 varieties, bringing in $500 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Command strips turned into a product empire, though, they also became captive to 3M’s unique form of industrial sprawl. Historically the company has organized its factories by material science and manufacturing processes, rather than by product—think chemicals in one facility, adhesives in another and packaging somewhere else, for example, regardless of their ultimate end use. This way, the thinking went, with each innovation, 3M could wring more value from existing machinery and underlying technologies. But every new product and geographic market also brought with it new costs and complexities, resulting in a labyrinthine factory network. This approach meant that Command strip production took place at multiple sites, sometimes hundreds of miles apart. Add in more steps for distribution, and the journey to Walmart shelves of what is, at base, just a particularly good sticky plastic hook looks pretty convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3M is one of the most sparkling brand names in US business history, known for advancing material science to the point that the first astronauts who walked on the moon were equipped with boots made from its synthetic rubber. If America wanted it, 3M could invent and produce it, building its fortunes on products as innocuous as Post-it notes and as dangerous as chemicals lining nonstick pans. From its headquarters in St. Paul, the company also became known in the business world for its Minnesota-nice corporate culture, a contrast to the ruthlessness championed by the likes of longtime General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch. 3M’s executives were unfailingly polite, its senior scientists were allowed to devote 15% of their time to research projects of their choosing, and many employees worked at 3M for their entire careers, long after staying in one job forever ceased to be fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But problems were bubbling under the surface, ones that went well beyond struggles with successful lines like the Command strip. First and foremost, those pan-lining chemicals—specifically certain types of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which were also used in products such as Scotchgard fabric protector and firefighting foam—have been found to increase the risk of cancer, decrease fertility and suppress the immune system, including weakening response to vaccines. Those findings have fueled a vast array of lawsuits that analysts estimate could end up costing 3M in the neighborhood of $20 billion, including ones it has already settled. Adding to those legal woes, the company spent years facing down major multidistrict litigation claiming it knowingly sold defective earplugs that left US military service members with hearing loss and tinnitus. (In agreements to resolve both of those lawsuits, 3M hasn’t admitted to any liability or wrongdoing.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As 3M dealt with these issues, its traditional strengths were atrophying. New product introductions slowed to a trickle, and sales growth was lackluster. If America wanted it, 3M grew less and less likely to be making it. By late 2021, as most businesses were regaining their footing after the pandemic, it appeared to many observers almost as if 3M had forgotten how to be a manufacturing company. Investors stopped treating it like one, viewing it more through the lens of liability and risk than of factory output and projected revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even 3M’s Minnesota-nice reputation has taken some hits. Senior executives privately complain that in recent years, beneath all the Midwestern cheer, the working environment has been marked by tone deafness, overbearing bureaucracy and resistance to change. Decisions were slow, fixes pushed by management felt blunt and grating, and accountability was hard to come by. Worker-safety protocols also lapsed, with the incident rate at its factories becoming significantly higher than at North American peers such as Corteva, Dow and GE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effectively, 3M became “a case study of everything not to do over a very long period of time,” says Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research LLC. It became a “broken company.” And when that happens, Davis says, “you want change, you crave change.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With almost $100 billion of market value wiped out from the peak in 2018 to the start of 2024, 3M last year tapped Bill Brown, an outsider who’d spent much of his career in the defense industry, to turn things around. He hosted his first earnings call about three months into the job. Analysts and investors expected him to offer the usual platitudes about hosting listening sessions and considering all options. Instead he talked about the Command strip—how it demonstrated perfectly that the company had gotten too big, too slow, too convoluted. Brown said he had a plan to tackle all that. 3M’s stock price shot up more than 20% by close, its best one-day rally in more than four decades on the public markets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment on the reporting in this story, instead saying in a statement that it’s “focused on creating shareholder value and positioning 3M for success by driving profitable growth, embedding a culture of operational excellence across the enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will help Brown’s turnaround plan that 3M’s liabilities have become less open-ended: A major settlement with water utilities over PFAS pollution and a deal to resolve the earplugs litigation, both agreed to in 2023, have reset investor expectations for the overall bill. The Trump administration also appears set to take a lighter touch to environmental regulation, providing relief to companies like 3M.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even the optimists concede that this is no easy fix. In the months since Brown took the reins, he’s been relying on the same playbook that Dave Cote used to restore Honeywell International Inc. in the early 2000s, when it faced a raft of asbestos lawsuits and the aftereffects of several dubious megamergers, and that Larry Culp deployed this decade to resuscitate GE when it was overwhelmed by debt and a $15 billion mess in a legacy insurance business. Brown’s plan starts with running 3M better. Get that right, and the really big problems—the amorphous liabilities, the cultural corrosion, the public-image crisis—won’t seem quite as insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minnesota Mining &amp;amp; Manufacturing started in 1902 as a venture to mine corundum, which is harder than all other minerals save for diamonds and an ideal ingredient in sandpaper. But when its founders discovered they were in fact extracting a different low-grade material, they decided to get out of mining and into making the sandpaper instead, using raw materials sourced elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, 3M didn’t discover PFAS. These synthetic chemicals trace back to the Manhattan Project, which required scientists to invent a way to extract uranium to make an atomic bomb. A chemical engineering professor at Pennsylvania State College named Joseph H. Simons developed a process to create almost unbreakable carbon fluorine bonds by passing raw fluorine, a highly volatile gas, through a carbon arc. He later developed a method for practical production of fluorocarbons, a process 3M employed to pioneer the use of PFAS in consumer and industrial products starting in the 1950s. The company eventually became a major producer both for its own products and for customers such as DuPont de Nemours Inc., which used it in Teflon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Near-indestructibility is useful for everything from developing nuclear weapons to repelling grease and water. But these chemicals take years to break down, making them highly problematic in the environment and the human body. For a long time, 3M billed manufactured PFAS and its PFAS-infused products as perfectly safe, even as internal documents and studies unearthed through lawsuits showed the company was aware of the chemicals’ toxicity at least as far back as the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1998, Richard Purdy, an ecological toxicologist at 3M, conducted a study that found PFAS even in the blood of bald eagle nestlings, which primarily eat fish and inhabit remote areas. He quit the next year and sent a copy of his resignation letter to the US Environmental Protection Agency, saying the company had failed to properly communicate to customers and regulators the results of research showing how prevalent the chemicals had become in people and the environment. In 2000, 3M announced it would voluntarily stop making the forms of the chemicals that had the most research documenting their hazards, even as it maintained the chemicals were safe and didn’t pose a long-term health issue. In 2006, the company reached a $1.5 million settlement with the EPA over reporting violations related to PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More research about the health consequences of PFAS followed, including an influential 2012 study of children born in the remote Faroe Islands that found the chemicals in bloodstreams at levels comparable to the US population and indicated a resulting weakened immune response to vaccines. As the production of certain kinds of PFAS declined, the concentration of the chemicals in people’s bloodstreams fell sharply, according to research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others. But after decades of use, the legal challenges, and the public fallout, were just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tipping point came in 2018. That January, The Devil We Know—an investigative documentary examining a West Virginia community’s fight against a plant, then owned by DuPont, that made Teflon—premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. A few weeks after that, 3M agreed, without admitting wrongdoing, to pay $850 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Minnesota over claims the company had poisoned drinking water in its own backyard. And in June the CDC, drawing on scientific advances that allowed PFAS detection at much lower levels, published a draft report warning that the chemicals can cause health problems at significantly lower exposure thresholds than what the EPA had claimed at the time was safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following month, Michael Roman took over as 3M’s CEO. A 30-year company veteran, Roman had overseen businesses in the US, Europe and Asia and had served as 3M’s chief operating officer. He was the embodiment of its culture of politesse, but this ultimately wouldn’t help him much with the storm that was brewing. PFAS claims came to span challenges from state attorneys general, water utilities, people with personal injury and property complaints, and foreign governments such as those of Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding to the pile, 3M was also being sued over an earplug business it had acquired through the 2008 purchase of Aearo Technologies. In July 2018, the same month Roman took over, 3M had agreed, without admitting wrongdoing, to a $9.1 million settlement with the US Department of Justice to resolve allegations that it had sold earplugs to the US military without disclosing defects. Cases brought by veterans claiming hearing damage mushroomed after the settlement and dragged on for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With potential liabilities stewing outside its factories, 3M was simultaneously dealing with issues inside them. Having long prided itself on being a desirable and safe place to work, the company was seeing an uptick in the number of safety violations at its factories. From 2019 to 2024, 3M received at least 27 “serious” initial citations, which are based on worksite investigations, from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—more than any other company among a group of its North American industrial and health-care technology peers, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3M also got one repeat admonishment and notice of three willful violations, meaning it knowingly failed to comply with a legal requirement or acted with “plain indifference to employee safety.” (3M and other companies in the dataset have contested many of the citations, and have in some cases succeeded in getting them downgraded or dismissed as part of settlements. In response to requests for comment from Businessweek, Carlisle said that its injury rate is “very low” compared with the industry average and that it seeks to “continuously improve” its safety standards, and GE said it took immediate action to report the incident that led to its citations and to prevent a reoccurrence.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two of 3M’s willful violations were linked to inadequate safeguards for a plastic extrusion machine that required employees to thread material through by hand. Trisha Jones, who operated the machine at the company’s plant in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, died in May 2023 after getting caught in the large rollers and suffering traumatic head injuries. “They’re not managing these facilities well,” says David Michaels, who ran OSHA from 2009 to 2017 and is now a professor of public health at George Washington University. “That’s a sign of safety management not being implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The safety incidents jarred with the benevolent culture workers had come to expect. Peter Gibbons, formerly in charge of overseeing supply chains across the company, would regularly contend that the biggest cause of injuries at factories was employees falling down stairs while using their phones, so much so that “Use the Handrail” became a running joke among staff, according to people with the company who, like others interviewed for this piece, asked not to be named discussing private interactions or information. (Gibbons didn’t respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People close to 3M say the rise in safety incidents reflected years of underinvestment in factories to save costs, as well as a decision by Roman in 2020 to make oversight of manufacturing operations the responsibility of managers in charge of the business lines, rather than ones who were on-site at plants. The shift was part of a 2020 reorganization, dubbed “Advanced 3M,” that was intended to make the company more responsive to customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was one of many sweeping gestures Roman undertook during his six years at the helm. Another was Polaris, a suite of digital tools introduced in 2021 to give customers a more Amazon-like experience when placing and tracking orders; the initiative ended up costing more than planned and hasn’t been fully implemented since going online, the people close to the company say. Roman also pursued several cost-cutting efforts that cost hundreds of workers their jobs while barely denting 3M’s financial results. In fact its profit margins went sideways, in contrast to peers that were improving manufacturing processes, raising prices and adding market share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During his tenure, Roman developed a reputation internally for being thin-skinned. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, he hosted virtual town halls as part of a planned series. But, according to the people close to the company, the series was abruptly canceled after he learned that anonymous commenters had criticized his presentations for reasons that included a lack of detail and transparency about Covid-19 strategy and protocols. (Roman didn’t respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roman’s biggest challenge may have been that an outsize amount of his time, rather than being spent running an industrial company, was spent managing the PFAS problem, even though manufactured PFAS represented a fraction of 3M’s business. In 2022 the Biden administration proposed to designate certain PFAS as hazardous materials under the federal Superfund law, and the EPA declared that virtually no amount of the chemicals is safe in drinking water. Not long after, Roman announced 3M would cease all remaining production of PFAS and work to discontinue their use in its products by the end of 2025. In internal deliberations, people familiar with the conversations say, executives had pointed out to Roman that PFAS are integral to the production of semiconductors, electric-vehicle batteries and weapons systems—the very types of goods the US government under President Joe Biden was seeking to make more of at home. At the very least, some argued, 3M should sell its PFAS manufacturing facilities rather than simply shutting them down. Roman didn’t want to hear it: 3M was done with PFAS, and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting all the PFAS out of its products has proved complicated, though. In a testament to how prevalent the chemicals have become, 3M has cautioned investors that they may continue to be present beyond 2025 in certain products that contain components manufactured by third parties, including lithium-ion batteries, printed circuit boards and some seals and gaskets. 3M said this is because approved substitutes that meet regulatory and industry standards may not be available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the year after Roman’s announcement, 3M finally started putting some of its legal challenges behind it. The company announced a deal in June 2023 to pay as much as $12.5 billion over 13 years to test and treat city water supplies for PFAS, resolving current and future claims by municipal utilities over pollution. A few months later it announced it had reached a separate $6 billion agreement to resolve claims in the earplug litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3M continued to chip away at its PFAS lawsuits after Brown replaced Roman in 2024. This May it agreed to pay New Jersey as much as $450 million to resolve claims related to PFAS pollution at the 3M-supplied Chambers Works plant, as well as general complaints about natural resource damage from the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As settlements have accrued, estimates for how much the company might ultimately have to pay have gone down. Andrew Obin, an analyst at Bank of America Corp., says 3M might be on the hook for $11.5 billion in settlements related to US suits over damages to natural resources alone. But he says the settlement math in New Jersey—which has particularly acute levels of PFAS pollution—implies his estimate for this category of claims should be materially lower, closer to $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regulatory landscape is also changing in ways that might help 3M. The shift began with the US Supreme Court’s decision, handed down last June 28, to overturn the Chevron doctrine, the legal principle that empowered executive branch agencies to interpret and enforce regulations. The ruling gave momentum to lawsuits filed by chemical industry and manufacturing groups as well as water utility associations, challenging the Biden administration’s limits on PFAS in drinking water as arbitrary and financially impossible. This May, President Donald Trump’s EPA announced it was delaying its compliance deadline for removal of the two best-known types of PFAS and was rescinding and reconsidering the limits on four other categories. And earlier this month, in a major shift, the EPA asked the court to vacate the drinking water rule for the four other categories of PFAS, concurring with the water utility plaintiffs that aspects of the process by which the standards had been established were unlawful. The agency has delayed a rule, too, that would have required PFAS manufacturers to file reports about environmental and health effects from 2011 to 2022. (The EPA said in a statement that it’s “committed to protecting public health by addressing PFAS in drinking water while following the law and ensuring that regulatory compliance is achievable for drinking water systems.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US Chamber of Commerce is also leading a lawsuit against the EPA over the designation of certain types of PFAS as hazardous materials under the Superfund law—which it contends could force companies to collectively pay as much as $17.4 billion in cleanup costs just for nonfederal sites that have been identified as a priority. After repeatedly getting the proceedings postponed, the Trump administration announced this month that it would retain the Superfund designation for the two best-known kinds of PFAS, while calling upon Congress to address concerns about entities getting stuck with cleanup bills for chemicals they didn’t themselves manufacture. The litigation itself continues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obin, the Bank of America analyst, pegs 3M’s liability for cleaning up Superfund sites at as much as $9 billion but says that bill could also end up being lower as legal challenges drag out the policy’s implementation. And he points out that the company could recover as much as 25% of its total PFAS liabilities through insurance payouts. “In conversations with investors, the narrative has changed,” Obin says. “Maybe three years ago, people would say, ‘Why are your estimates so low?’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3M’s other big remaining undefined PFAS liability is personal injury lawsuits. These, too, may turn out to be less financially crippling than analysts previously feared. In major multidistrict litigation, plaintiffs are arguing that they got cancer by being exposed to water contaminated with PFAS from firefighting foam and are seeking damages from 3M and other companies. The defendants’ lawyers have sought to exclude expert testimony for the plaintiffs on the link between PFAS and cancer, contending that they relied on research findings that aren’t statistically significant at the relevant exposure levels for the claimants. A bellwether trial had been set to come before a federal district court in South Carolina in October. It’s since been postponed “until such a time as the court deems appropriate,” to allow both sides to sift through a large number of unfiled claims and determine which of these should be included in the proceeding. The judge overseeing the case has urged the two sides to settle, and this latest development may make such an agreement more likely, according to Barclays Plc analyst Julian Mitchell. As it stands, Mitchell estimates that all of 3M’s outstanding PFAS liabilities, including personal injury and natural resources claims, could be as much as $11 billion, down from his $16 billion calculation immediately after an agreement to settle the water lawsuits was announced in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies have recovered from liability disasters before. Davis, the Melius Research analyst, recalls a peer predicting in the early 2000s that Honeywell would go bankrupt because of asbestos claims, as well as a short seller who infamously claimed GE was on a path to financial collapse because of festering liabilities in a legacy insurance business. Neither forecast came true. The critical thing for 3M, Davis says, is improving cash flow so its liabilities seem less like an existential wrecking ball than an expense. It needs to improve to the point that “cash-flow growth is so strong that people say, ‘You know what? They’ve got the liabilities, and they can do buybacks and M&amp;amp;A, and operate as a real entity.’” The key for Honeywell and GE, he points out, was finding the right CEO to clean up their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3M’s choice for that was Brown. Before signing on, he had a successful career overseeing defense contractor Harris Corp., now known as L3Harris Technologies Inc. after he shepherded a merger with L3 Technologies in 2019. Former colleagues say they thought that, after Brown stepped down in 2022, he might land a cushy private equity gig, not join a struggling conglomerate facing giant legal liabilities. Asked earlier this year at a JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. conference why he took the 3M job given the PFAS baggage, Brown joked that it wasn’t the -15F winter weather at headquarters in Minnesota. Rather, he said, PFAS had been so all-consuming for 3M that it had an opportunity to simply pay more attention to everything else—as long as the liabilities didn’t end up being worse than investors’ downtrodden expectations, then 3M’s stock price could climb much higher. It was, he added, “a great opportunity to engage with this great iconic company called 3M and try to help make it great again.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filings show that Brown is either 62 or 63 (the company declined to specify which). Known as an exercise fanatic, he’s trying to bring a comparable rigor of routine to 3M. The plan he’s revealed for fixing it isn’t all that complex. For starters, he cleared out much of the upper management under his predecessor, including replacing the chief financial officer, the head of investor relations and the top supply chain manager. Brown also lured in Amazon.com Inc. executive Wendy Bauer to take over 3M’s transportation and electronics division.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s vowed, too, to reboot 3M’s vaunted “innovation machine,” to cut costs and to drag the company’s manufacturing operations into the modern era, including making factories safer. “Our performance in safety has not been where we should be,” he said at the conference. “Our focus is around zero injuries, zero spills, zero incidents.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brown has also been pushing to improve how the company satisfies orders—when he took over, more than 10% of 3M deliveries were showing up late or incomplete—and how it makes each product in its sprawling portfolio. He’s suggested the company might reduce its 25,000-strong network of suppliers and eventually its empire of 110 factories, with its manufacturing equipment currently being used at only about 60% of capacity. Every week he and his top lieutenants review 3M’s business lines and factories, hunting for logjams and inefficiencies that cause deliveries to fall short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those who worked with Brown at L3Harris praise his leadership style. An engineer by training, he’s obsessed with pursuing excellence in all facets of a company’s operations, according to Jay Malave, a former L3Harris executive who was recently named Boeing Co.’s CFO. Rahul Ghai, CFO of GE Aerospace and a former Brown deputy himself, says, “What makes him successful is his tremendous attention to detail.” He adds: “This is the right guy for the job.” Both say that even though Brown can be demanding, he delivers marching orders with positivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a Bank of America conference in May, Brown said 3M’s culture needs to encourage more individual accountability if his other improvements are to stick. When he joined the company, only about 10 people had performance-based stock compensation agreements. Now 1,500 people are paid this way. And everyone is being encouraged to act with urgency. The mantra, he said, is “Get it done tonight, not tomorrow. If it can be done in the next minute, do it in the next minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite recent market volatility related to the global trade war started by Trump’s tariffs, 3M shares are still worth about 60% more than they were when Brown started last May. That’s more than double the gains for a broader group of industrial companies on the S&amp;amp;P 500 over that time period. But the stock is still down about 30% from its peak in early 2018, before the PFAS challenges came to a head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brown has been at pains to emphasize to investors that this turnaround isn’t going to be quick. Success would be resolving 3M’s legal cases without any jarring surprises, revving its innovation apparatus back up to the point that investors are convinced it can increase revenue, and improving the efficiency of its supply chain and manufacturing network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a testament to how hard that last challenge will be, Brown isn’t the first 3M CEO to cite the Command strip as an example of what needs to be fixed: George Buckley, who ran the company from 2005 to 2012, used to describe 3M’s disjointed assembly processes for the strip and other products as “hairballs.” At the time he started trying to untangle these knots, one part of the production process for Command hooks began with adhesives made at a 3M plant in Missouri, which were then shipped to Indiana to be applied to polyethylene foam. The foam then went to Minnesota, where the 3M logo was added and the strips were cut to size. Finally the tabs went to Wisconsin to be packaged along with a plastic hook. According to company executives interviewed by the Wall Street Journal in 2012, under Buckley’s oversight, 3M consolidated these particular steps in the Command strip production at one plant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was an improvement, sure, though it didn’t resolve the problem. Today, the end-to-end process still spans a handful of factories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You will never fix it, because that was how the company was built,” Obin says of 3M’s manufacturing labyrinth. But perhaps that’s OK. He points out that it wasn’t an issue during periods in the company’s history when revenue and profits were growing. “It just needs to be run properly.”&lt;/p&gt;

No Windows 11, Microsoft says as another loophole snaps shut</title><updated>2025-10-07T16:12:16.203674+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="3f986a36e76660d6"&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;No account? No Windows 11, Microsoft says as another loophole snaps shut&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Workaround sent to the big OOBE in the sky with latest Insider builds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is closing a popular loophole that allowed users to install Windows 11 without a Microsoft account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change has appeared in recent Insider builds of Windows 11, indicating it is likely to be included in the production version soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft refers to these loopholes as "known mechanisms" and is talking about local commands in this instance. You can learn all about these in our piece for getting Windows 11 installed with a local account, but suffice to say &lt;code&gt;start ms-cxh:localonly&lt;/code&gt; is no more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"While these mechanisms were often used to bypass Microsoft account setup, they also inadvertently skip critical setup screens, potentially causing users to exit OOBE with a device that is not fully configured for use," Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Users will need to complete OOBE with internet and a Microsoft account, to ensure [the] device is set up correctly."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows 10 refuses to go gentle into that good night&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hundreds of orgs urge Microsoft: don't kill off free Windows 10 updates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows 11 25H2 is mostly 24H2 with bits bolted on or ripped out&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Healthcare lags in Windows 11 upgrades – and lives may depend on it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as Redmond is concerned, this is all for the user's own good. It is also important to note that managed devices are not directly affected, just hardware that users want to get running with Windows 11 without having to deal with a Microsoft Account during setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change is part of Microsoft's ongoing game of Whac-A-Mole with users trying to find ways of avoiding its online services. In March, it removed the &lt;code&gt;bypassnro.cmd&lt;/code&gt; script that allowed users to get through the Windows 11 setup without needing an internet connection. That time, Microsoft said the change was to "enhance security and user experience of Windows 11."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There remain a number of ways to avoid the Microsoft account requirement during setup, including setting up an unattended installation, but these are more complicated. It is also clear that Microsoft is determined to continue closing loopholes where it can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is getting increasingly difficult to use Windows 11 on an unmanaged device without a Microsoft account. Users who don't want to sign up should perhaps consider whether it's time to look at an alternative operating system instead. ®&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Swiss glaciers have shrunk by a quarter since 2015, study says&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switzerland’s glaciers have lost 24 percent of their volume over the past decade, researchers said Wednesday, warning that accelerated melting in 2025 brought ice loss close to record levels. Scientists warn that Switzerland’s glaciers could nearly vanish by the end of this century without stronger actions to counter global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switzerland's glaciers, which are disproportionately impacted by climate change, have lost a quarter of their volume in the past decade alone, a study warned Wednesday, heightening concerns over accelerating melting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, glacial melting in the Alpine nation was once again "enormous", the Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (GLAMOS) network said, adding that it was close to the record set in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A winter with little snow combined with summer heatwaves in June and August saw Switzerland's glaciers lose three percent of their volume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That marks the fourth-largest level of shrinkage since measurements began, trailing only 2022, 2023 and 2003, according to GLAMOS's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glaciers across the Alps have been retreating for more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in recent decades, the process has sped up as the climate warms, driven by humanity's burning of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Since about 20 years, all glaciers in Switzerland are losing ice, and the rate of this loss is accelerating," GLAMOS chief Matthias Huss told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between 2015 and 2025 alone, the glaciers shed 24 percent of their volume, Wednesday's report said, compared to 10 percent between 1990 and 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Melting away&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GLAMOS researchers did extensive measurements at around 20 reference glaciers in September, and extrapolated the findings to Switzerland's 1,400 glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Europe's Alpine region has been hard-hit by climate change, with warming in Switzerland progressing at twice the pace of the global average, according to the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Alpine countries are also seeing glaciers retreat, and researchers highlight that those in Switzerland -- whose mountain peaks are higher than in neighbouring Austria -- may have a better chance of surviving the increasingly hot summers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, scientists warn that Switzerland's glaciers could all but disappear by the end of this century without more action to rein in global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We can't avoid the glacier melting overall," GLAMOS head Huss said, but "we can slow it down... with globally coordinated climate action".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If carbon dioxide emissions "are brought to zero within 30 years... we could still save about one-third of the Swiss glaciers", Huss added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the early 1970s, more than 1,100 Swiss glaciers have disappeared completely, according to GLAMOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Destabilising' mountains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overlooking the Rhone Glacier, near Gletsch village, Huss said the giant ice mass had lost more than 100 metres (330 feet) in height in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's really a devastation of the ice," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Argentine tourist Wincho Ponte, 29, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was "really sad that it's melting so quickly", Pointe said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Water reserves have meanwhile been dwindling as the glaciers retreat, causing increasing problems in the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huss cautioned that this could hit "water availability not only up here in the mountains but also all the way down to the Mediterranean Sea".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The continuous diminishing of glaciers also contributes to the destabilising of mountains", he warned, pointing to the Swiss village of Blatten, which was wiped out by a dramatic glacier collapse in May.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GLAMOS determined that Swiss glacier volume will total 45.1 cubic kilometres (10.8 cubic miles) at the end of this year -- or 30 km3 less than in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, the surface area of Swiss glaciers covers 755 square kilometres -- a decline of 30 percent over the past 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, Switzerland's second-hottest June on record contributed to snow melting rapidly, even at the highest altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;August brought a fresh heatwave, pushing the freezing line as high as 5,000 metres above sea level -- well above the peak of western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a rather cool and damp July "provided some relief and prevented an even worse outcome", GLAMOS said, with a few cold fronts resulting in individual days with fresh snow at higher altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overall summer melt this year was therefore only 15 percent above the 2010-2020 average -- its lowest level in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Swap runtimes by pointing to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, Mistral, Anyscale). Update &lt;code&gt;runtime.provider&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;base_url&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;api_key&lt;/code&gt;; regenerate schema types if you add a new provider enum.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bring your own vector store by implementing a store backend, adding it to &lt;code&gt;rag/schema.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, and updating the server service registry.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add parsers/extractors to support new file formats or metadata pipelines. Register implementations and extend the schema definitions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extend the CLI with new Cobra commands under &lt;code&gt;cli/cmd&lt;/code&gt;; the docs include guidance on adding dataset utilities or project tooling.&lt;/item&gt;
