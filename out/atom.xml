  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We influence others every day, whether we intend to or not. Sometimes it is through the way we argue, sometimes through the way we listen, and sometimes simply through the story we tell about what matters. Influence is not the property of the few who hold authority. It is the currency of all relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The word persuasion often carries with it the scent of manipulation, as though one person is moving another toward something they do not really want. But there is another way to hold it. Influence can be understood as an invitation. It is the art of meeting people where they are, of entering their world with respect, and of opening a door that they might choose to walk through with us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article invites you to consider five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging. Each opens a different path into relationship and commitment. Each has its gifts. Each, when overused, can become a wall instead of a door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The practice is not to master all five overnight, but to grow our awareness and our range. Persuasion is not a personality trait. It is a skill. It asks us to listen, to notice, and to choose consciously how we invite others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our own doorway: The blind spot of preference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of us have a default style of persuasion. Perhaps you lean on facts. Perhaps you rely on conviction. Perhaps you search for compromise, tell stories, or call on the voices of others. None of these is wrong. Each is a doorway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet our default does more than shape how we speak. It shapes how we see. If I lean on data, I may hear someone’s story as weak rather than inspiring. If I favour conviction, I may interpret hesitation as lack of commitment, when it might be an opening for negotiation. If I thrive on inspiration, I may dismiss detail-oriented questions as nit-picking rather than as a real need for clarity. If I am most comfortable with bridging, I may feel uneasy with those who are direct and independent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our own doorway becomes a filter. It colours what we pay attention to, what we dismiss, and how we react. The danger is that we mistake difference for resistance. We think they are being difficult, when in fact they are simply standing at another door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Becoming aware of our preference allows us to pause. Instead of defending our own style, we can ask: What is the invitation they are offering me through their language and behaviour? Which door are they holding open that I have overlooked because I was guarding my own?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influence begins with this act of humility. The willingness to see that the door we most trust may not be the one others are waiting at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we recognise our blind spot, we are ready to notice the variety of doors available to us. Influence is not one way, it is five ways. Each has its own language, its own gifts, and its own risks. Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging are not personality types but choices. At any moment, we can choose to knock on a different door, depending on where others are standing and what the moment requires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What follows is a closer look at each door. how to recognise it, how to walk through it well, and how to avoid turning it into a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rationalising: The door of logic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rationalising is the style that seeks to persuade through facts, evidence, and analysis. It appeals to those who are comforted by structure and clarity. When someone asks for data, compares benchmarks, or worries about risk and performance, they are standing at the rational door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This style has its strengths. It reassures the finance director who needs a business case. It appeals to the engineer who wants proof that the system will not fail. It builds trust with the analyst who measures quality by what can be verified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enter this door well, we come prepared. We gather our facts. We organise our thinking into a clear flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation. We know the return on investment, the efficiency gains, the quality improvements. We anticipate objections and hold evidence ready to meet them. We present data not as a weapon but as a gift of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet logic alone is not enough. Overused, it can become cold and detached. The person across from us may long for empathy, but we bury them in numbers. They may seek relationship, but we offer them a chart. Rationalising can easily turn into proving a point rather than creating understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reflection questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Which metrics or outcomes matter most to this person, and have I framed my case in those terms, for example ROI, risk, quality or efficiency?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What is my one-page flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Which objections are most likely, and what independent sources will I cite to address them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Where will a chart or comparison clarify, and where could visuals overwhelm?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What level of evidence would be enough for this decision, and how will I check for overload signals in the moment?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Where might I be using facts to prove a point rather than to build shared understanding?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• If they are not data-driven, which second door will I pivot to after I test for fit?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What jargon should I remove to keep the message precise and clear?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Asserting: The door of conviction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asserting persuades through confidence, authority, and clarity. It is the voice that speaks directly and without hesitation. It is the person who values decisiveness, who prefers a straight line over a winding explanation, who respects those who stand their ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You recognise this style when someone expresses strong opinions with little hesitation, when they challenge ideas and expect you to do the same, when they respond best to conviction rather than ambiguity. For them, clarity is a form of respect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enter this door well, we speak with confidence. We choose firm language, declarative statements, uncluttered by qualifiers. We are direct and concise. We know our boundaries, and we state them. We are ready with anchor points: two or three firm reasons why our proposal matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The temptation, though, is to confuse assertiveness with aggression. Overused, asserting becomes domineering. It silences others. It leaves no room for dialogue. It builds resistance where it meant to build respect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reflection questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What exactly am I asking for in one clear sentence?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What is non-negotiable, and what is flexible?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What two or three anchor reasons will I use to support my position?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How will I signal credibility without drifting into name-dropping or status plays?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What does matching their energy look like while staying respectful and calm?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Where will I deliberately pause to listen so I do not over-talk the room?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What early signals tell me I am tipping into pressure, and how will I de-escalate?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• If directness stalls the dialogue, what is my next door to try?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Negotiating: The door of balance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Negotiating persuades by finding common ground. It seeks the middle path, the workable solution, the compromise that honours both sides. It is rooted in the belief that influence is not about victory but about mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You notice this style in those who raise concerns gently, who suggest meeting halfway, who speak in terms of “what if” and “could we.” They are pragmatic. They value win–win outcomes. They prefer flexibility over confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enter this door well, we listen closely to uncover the real concern beneath the stated one. We protect what matters most to us while staying open to trade-offs. We come with options. We ask open-ended questions. We remain collaborative, treating the conversation as joint problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But compromise has its dangers. Overused, negotiation turns into unnecessary concession. We may be seen as weak or uncertain. Others may begin every conversation expecting us to bend. We may give away value before fully exploring our own position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reflection questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What is the real concern beneath what is being said, and how will I surface it with open questions?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Which larger goals or principles am I protecting, and what are my red lines?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What tradables or creative options can I offer that create value without giving away too much?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What do I expect in return for each concession?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How will I hold a respectful, collaborative tone so we stay in joint problem solving?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• At what point would compromise become drift, and how will I name that threshold?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• If others expect automatic concessions from me, how will I reset expectations early?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What alternative door will I use if bargaining signals are not present?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inspiring: The door of vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspiring persuades through story, metaphor, and imagination. It calls people to something larger than themselves. It shifts the focus from what is practical to what is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know you are with an inspiring type when they disengage from technical talk but light up at mention of purpose or possibility. They ask about impact and legacy. They respond to stories and metaphors. They look for meaning, not just measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enter this door well, we tell relevant stories. We use vivid language and imagery. We connect ideas to values and aspirations. We speak with authenticity and passion. We invite others to imagine: What if you could? What would it feel like if…?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet inspiration without grounding can lose its way. Overused, it becomes idealistic, disconnected from reality, heavy with promise and light on delivery. Listeners may nod politely but ask for numbers that never come. Trust fades when vision is not matched by action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reflection questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What specific story from their world will make this possibility feel real and credible?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What image or analogy will help them visualise success?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Which values or purpose of theirs does this idea serve, for example impact, legacy, innovation or customer experience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What is the smallest concrete next step that grounds the vision?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Where will I invite imagination with a genuine what if question, then check for practical concerns?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What numbers or proof points should I have ready if they ask for them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How will I keep my tone authentic so enthusiasm does not outpace deliverables?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• If inspiration lands politely but without commitment, which door will I move to next?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bridging: The door of relationship&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bridging persuades through connection and social proof. It is the style that builds trust by involving others, by leaning on shared experience, by showing that someone else has walked this path before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You recognise it when someone asks, “Who else is doing this?” or seems hesitant until they hear a peer’s endorsement. They value rapport and trust more than unknown data. They commit when they see others they respect committing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enter this door well, we bring in mutual contacts. We offer testimonials and case studies. We emphasise shared goals. We give before we ask, offering help, making introductions, extending reciprocity. We are warm and attentive, because this style rests on human connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here too lies a danger. Overused, bridging makes us dependent on others. We may delay decisions, waiting for third-party validation. We may undermine our own authority, deferring to outside voices instead of speaking for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reflection questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Who do they already trust that I can appropriately involve, and how will I make that connection?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Which case study or testimonial best mirrors their context?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How will I frame our shared goals so alignment is explicit?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What value can I offer first, for example a helpful introduction or insight, before asking for commitment?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• How will I keep momentum without waiting for every third party to weigh in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Where do I need to speak in my own voice so I do not over-rely on others’ validation?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• What is my plan to sustain the relationship beyond this single decision?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• If bridging slows progress, which door should I try to regain decisiveness?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Living the paradox of influence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these five doors, Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, offers a path into relationship. Each works best when it honours the person we hope to influence rather than serving only our own habits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paradox is that any of them, when overused, becomes a wall. Logic turns cold. Conviction turns harsh. Compromise turns weak. Vision turns empty. Relationship turns dependent. What begins as invitation can end as imposition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The practice is not to abandon our natural style but to notice when it no longer serves. To ask: Which doorway is this person already standing at? What language are they using? What energises them? What shuts them down?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influence then becomes less about pressing harder on the door we know, and more about walking around to the door they are holding open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persuasion is not about clever tactics or manipulation. It is about presence. It is about listening for what matters to others and choosing consciously how we invite them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question that remains for each of us is simple: Which door will you choose to knock on in your next conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have any tips or advice? What has worked for you? Do you have any recommended resources to explore? Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Influenced by&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, are my synthesis, but several bodies of work have shaped them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Gary Yukl’s research on leadership influence tactics, which identified patterns such as rational persuasion, pressure, exchange, inspirational appeals, and coalition tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Robert Cialdini’s principles of persuasion, especially authority, social proof, reciprocity, and consistency, which continue to show how people respond to influence in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Negotiation practice and theory, from both organisational behaviour research and classic works on principled negotiation, which highlight the importance of mutual benefit and trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Leadership and change literature, including Peter Block’s writings on community and invitation, which shape the idea of influence as a relational act rather than a manipulative one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• My own work with leadership teams, where repeated practice has confirmed that leaders tend to default to one or two styles, often without realising the limits this creates in how they see and respond to others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These streams converge in the five doors. They are not meant as a new theory, but as a practical frame that leaders can hold in the moment, to choose how they wish to invite others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Venus is arguably the worst place in the solar system. A cloak of carbon dioxide suffocates the planet, subjecting its surface to skull-crushing pressure. Sulfuric acid rains down through the sickly yellow sky but never reaches the lava-licked ground. Venus is so hot — hot enough to melt lead — that the acid rain evaporates as it’s falling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The planet’s extreme inhospitality is at the heart of one of the most beguiling mysteries in planetary science. Venus and Earth formed at the same time, from the same geologic building blocks, in pretty much the same part of the solar system. They’re even the same size. So why is Venus a hellscape, and Earth a garden?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common refrain in the scientific community is that Venus is just several steps ahead — that it represents the end state of all large rocky planets, including Earth. The hypothesis is that these planets eventually lose the ability to sequester planet-warming greenhouse gases in their geologic underbelly. When those gases then accumulate in the atmosphere, the world enters a runaway greenhouse state — like the boiling hot Venusian climate. “Over the years, we’d always heard about Venus being a preview into Earth’s future,” said Stephen Kane, a planetary astrophysicist at the University of California, Riverside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But is that long-held assumption true? In hundreds of millions or billions of years, will Earth’s climate go the way of Venus’, transitioning from a temperate world into a catastrophic hothouse? Kane and his colleagues have been trying to find out. Venus and Earth are often referred to as twins, with Venus being the evil one of the pair. In their Reuniting Twins project, the scientists have developed a digital model of Earth that combines solar physics, volcanology, plate tectonics and climate science. They’ve been pushing their model Earth to its extremes, trying every plausible way to break it and make it into Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as exploring what went so wrong on the second rock from the sun, this work speaks to a query closer to home, said Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not directly involved with the project: “How long is Earth habitable for?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Planetary Whodunit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forecasting Earth’s future requires an understanding of Venus’ past. Long ago, Venus might not have been too different from how Earth is now. Spacecraft surveys and telescope observations have revealed the existence of a rare, heavy form of water in the Venusian atmosphere — a telltale sign that regular water used to be abundant on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers debate how that water resided there. One possibility is that the water on young Venus formed steam that wafted above the magma sea covering the newborn planet’s surface. That water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas, would have pushed the world into a scorching-hot greenhouse state not long after its birth. Alternatively, Venus’ initial, planetwide magma sea might have cooled and hardened into a crust quickly enough for liquid water — maybe even an ocean’s worth of water — to flow across it. If that is true, then what happened to all that water?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Michael Way, a planetary scientist and climate modeler at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, looked at two possibilities for how a Venusian ocean could have boiled away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first hypothesis points to the sun, which, as it ages and burns through its hydrogen fuel, blasts out ever more sunlight, subjecting nearby planets — including Venus, which sits closer to the sun than we do — to an increasingly intense blaze. Planetary scientists estimate that by about a billion years after the solar system’s birth, the gradually brightening sun would have been able to efficiently vaporize any liquid water on Venus. Water vapor would then have flooded the Venusian atmosphere, potentially causing intensive global warming; this warming might have been exacerbated further by volcanoes off-gassing carbon dioxide. The combination might have pushed Venus into a runaway greenhouse state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a nice story. But according to Way’s models, the theory that the sun broke Venus by evaporating its oceans has problems. Venus spins very slowly on its axis, and one day there is equivalent to 116 Earth days, or nearly four months. If the planet’s dayside initially held liquid oceans, that water’s evaporation would have formed thick clouds. Those prodigious, persistent dayside clouds would have reflected sunlight, keeping Venus cooler than it otherwise might have been and actually preventing a runaway greenhouse effect and unrestrained global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Way thinks that a more plausible suspect in Venus’ demise is a form of ruinous volcanism. In its own storied past, Earth experienced prolonged eruptions of lava in single regions, known as large igneous provinces (LIPs), that lasted for hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of years. Each of these events injected copious carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and made the world, for a time, extremely hot. One LIP 252 million years ago triggered the worst recorded mass extinction in Earth’s history, almost sterilizing the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately for life, after each of these LIP events, Earth gradually drew that excess carbon dioxide deep into its rocky bowels, and the planet cooled back down. It accomplished this through a process called subduction: When tectonic plates collide, one plate can descend below the other, drawing seawater rich in dissolved carbon dioxide into the abyssal depths. That carbon remains sequestered in the lower mantle for epochal lengths of time; some of it eventually erupts back into the atmosphere via volcanism. That, in a nutshell, is how Earth’s global thermostat is regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible that back when there was water on Venus, it also had Earth-like plate tectonics with major subduction zones. But the system wasn’t widespread or large-scale enough to save it from a planetary immolation — especially if several LIP events occurred at roughly the same time. Way’s models show that several concurrent LIPs could have thrown vast quantities of carbon dioxide into Venus’ atmosphere, warming the world so severely that much of its liquid water boiled away into the sky, accelerating the warming further. With no oceans to speak of, all that carbon dioxide could not be reabsorbed. Moreover, water is an enabler of subduction: It lowers the melting point of rocks, allowing tectonic plates to more easily bend and break. And so, with no water left at the surface, major subduction zones would grind to a halt, preventing the entombment of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other scientists tend to agree with Way’s assessment: The sun alone cannot be responsible for making Venus the awful place it is today. “I really do think you need multiple extreme volcanic episodes … to get there,” said Anna Gülcher, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Break the World&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While studying Venus and its runaway greenhouse wasteland, Kane became morbidly curious: Could the same fate befall Earth? “What if we shut down the carbon cycle on Earth?” he said. “Could you produce a Venus?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find out, he and his team built a virtual world-destroying machine. “Everybody loves a post-apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, provided it’s 5 billion years in our future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Stephen Kane&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step was to fast-forward their model of Earth about 3.5 billion years, to when the sun and planets will be 8 billion years old. At that point, the sun will shine brighter than it does today, and Earth’s atmosphere will receive the same level of roasting-hot starlight that Venus did when it was just 1 billion years old. Back then, it’s thought, Venus would have been at a tipping point: either temperate and waterlogged, or burnt to a crisp. The 8 billion-year-old sun will push Earth to a similar, climatic knife-edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team’s model suggests that in 3.5 billion years, Earth’s oceans could begin evaporating and become heat-trapping water vapor in the atmosphere. That could be sufficient to kill off Earth’s major subduction zones, since without water, there might be no subduction (plus, there would be less water for carbon dioxide to dissolve into in the first place). “We’re losing the ability to draw back that CO2 into the Earth’s mantle. So it just builds up,” said Michelle Hill of Stanford University, a member of the Reuniting Twins project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shutdown of major subduction zones would mean that the Earth’s tectonic plates stop clashing and jostling about. Instead, they would form a near-united rocky shell around the hot mantle. For a time, the mantle would get hotter, since the shell around it would trap heat generated by radioactively decaying compounds inside it. As heat accumulates in the interior, the Earth in Kane’s simulations would experience an uptick in volcanism lasting for about 15 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This period, known as a “stagnant lid regime,” adds even more carbon dioxide to the sky. But the eruptive spike is short-lived. The mantle cools down and the crust thickens until it becomes nearly impermeable to any major carbon-erupting volcanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So 15 million years after its stagnant lid forms, Earth will have reached a new equilibrium. Occasional spurts of volcanism would still happen. (Likewise, scientists have found compelling evidence that Venus is volcanically active today.) But Kane explained that these sporadic eruptions aren’t expected to add much carbon to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, the team’s simulations stop. How Venus-like is their model of the future Earth?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;USGS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;There’s No Place Like Venus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If or when Earth’s large-scale subduction shuts off in about 3.5 billion years, kneecapping the planet’s ability to bury carbon, Kane and his team’s simulations indicate that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere will rise anywhere from 0.1 bars to 0.8 bars. (For reference, the total atmospheric pressure at sea level today is 1 bar, and roughly 0.04% of that, or 0.042 bars, comes from carbon dioxide.) Even in their best-case scenario of a 0.1-bar rise in carbon dioxide, Earth’s surface temperature surpasses 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). The same happens at 0.8 bars, but far more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either way, the surface of the world becomes literally boiling hot. Earth will “turn into a post-runaway greenhouse state,” Kane said. “The surface temperature will be too hot for any water. It’ll all boil away.” Nothing sitting on the world’s skin would survive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Earth won’t get close to the state that Venus is in today. “It’d be Venus lite,” Kane said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Venus has a 93-bar atmosphere consisting of 96.5% carbon dioxide. Kane and his colleagues’ doomsday machine, no matter how hard they push it, cannot take Earth to those levels. “I was surprised by that,” he said. Because the mantle is sealed off by a stagnant lid, volcanism drops, protecting Earth from a Venus-style roasting better than he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Independent scientists have praised the Reuniting Twins project for challenging prior assumptions and adding significantly to the discussion about the terminal state of rocky planets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I like their idea,” Way said, adding that the team’s version of a future Earth “doesn’t sound unreasonable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You end up with a world that’s stinkingly hot,” said Byrne, the Washington University planetary scientist. But, he said, the possibility that it may not be Venusian levels of hot is intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kane’s team acknowledged that their model hasn’t considered LIP-style mega-eruptions, and that these events could feasibly add a bounty of trapped carbon to the atmosphere at any point in the future. Maybe Earth gets unlucky and experiences multiple, simultaneous LIP events (though this grows less likely over time, Kane said, as the mantle cools and its churning slows). If so, that scenario could push Earth to be more like Venus than the team’s model suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncertainties abound. But if Kane’s team is even broadly correct, it suggests that Venus has a uniquely grim history. Something — perhaps an inundation of lava — burned that planet to the bone. Earth, meanwhile, has so far been unable to bring about its own destruction. Let’s hope that remains the case long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Biconnected Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many articles online about graphs and (1-)connected components, but not many about biconnected components (BCCs), even though these are way more interesting and can be used to solve many problems! Especially in competitive programming it is vital to know about this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will outline what biconnected components are, how they work similar to/different from connected components, and how to find them algorithmically (with C++ code included). Presumed knowledge is knowing what a graph is. Sections:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Biconnectedness in a Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's introduce the concept by looking at a problem that BCCs could help solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charlotte is a secret agent for Enforcement of Metro Integrity (EMI), and she is tasked with transporting a top-secret package from one of her informants, Alice, to an undercover agent, Bob. Alice and Bob must not meet each other, because that would ruin the safety of the mission, so they must be at different metro stations, and Charlotte can naturally only use the metro network for transport. The matter is further complicated by the fact that Eve, Charlotte's adversary, is trying to sabotage the mission by disabling one unknown metro connection! For the sets of meeting locations \( A \) where Alice can meet and \( B \) where Bob can meet, how many possible pairs \( (a, b) \) are there such that Charlotte can safely transport the package from \( a \) to \( b \) no matter which line Eve disables?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example metro network 1: nodes in the \( A \) set are marked with an A, nodes in the \( B \) set are marked with a B; an example valid pair of locations would be \( (3, 1) \), because no matter which metro line Eve chooses to sabogate, there is still a path from \( 3 \) to \( 1 \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The metro network is a graph \( G \) with \( n \) nodes (metro stations) and \( m \) edges (metro lines). \( A \) and \( B \) are then subsets of the set of nodes \( V(G) \). We are trying to find an algorithm with the best possible running time. We can use the following definition to make the objective a bit more precise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definition: two nodes \( a, b \) are edge-biconnected if for any edge \( e \), there exists a path from \( a \) to \( b \) that does not go through \( e \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then in this problem we are trying to count the number of pairs \( (a, b) \) with \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \) that are edge-biconnected. After all, no matter what edge Eve sabotages, we always still have a path between the two nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most naive algorithm would be to consider each \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \). We would then go over each edge, remove it, and check if there is still a path from \( a \) to \( b \) using a simple graph traversal. This approach would have a time complexity of \( O(|A| \cdot |B| \cdot m \cdot (n + m)) \), which is very bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could try to speed up this approach by precomputing for each edge the connected components (CCs) of the graph without that edge, making the path checking constant time. First we would start with the set of all \( (a, b) \) pairs, and iteratively remove pairs that we find can be blocked off by Eve's sabotage. Then we would iterate over each of the \( m \) edges, and: (1) remove it and compute for each node in which connected component it lies (\( O(m + n) \) time using a simple graph traversal), and (2) for each \( (a, b) \) pair, remove it if they do not both lie in the same connected component (now a constant time operation, so \( O(|A| \cdot |B|) \) overall). This leads to to a complexity of \( O(m \cdot ((n + m) + |A| \cdot |B|)) \), which is definitely an improvement, and we considered how to leverage connected components. Click through the animation below to see how this algorithm would work (the dashed circles indicate connected components with the edge removed). However, the running time is still quite miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: remove pairs starting with 5 ending with 1/6/7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: remove pairs starting with 2/4/5 ending with 6/7, and pairs starting with 6/8 ending with 1/5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final set of pairs is \( \{ (2, 1), (4, 1), ~~ (5, 5), ~~ (6, 6), (6, 7), (8, 6), (8, 7) \} \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, we are definitely doing a lot of unnecessary work, and you might also notice that the final set of pairs has a specific pattern to it (whitespace to make this a bit more obvious). We can (suggestively) draw the pairs in the graph as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that we just have a few clusters of nodes, and within each cluster every possible pair is interconnected (a clustering like this is called a partition of the nodes). Can we prove that we can always find such a clustering/partition? Or could it be that in some graph, there is an edge-biconnected pair \( x, y \), an edge-biconnected pair \( y, z \), but not an edge-biconnected pair \( x, z \)? (Think about counterexamples, or convince yourself this should always hold.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Edge-Biconnected Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, I am kind of giving it away by naming this section like this. But it is a very doable exercise to prove that such a partition is always possible, where within each cluster all the pairs are connected through a pair of edge-disjoint paths, and between two distinct clusters, there are no pairs connected in that way. When thinking about partitions, you should always think about the mathematical concept of an equivalence relation. If edge-biconnectedness were an equivalence relation, we would need to prove the following three properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reflexivity: any node \( u \) is edge-biconnected to itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symmetry: if \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \), then \( v \) must be edge-biconnected to \( u \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transitivity: if \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \) and \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \), then \( u \) must be edge-biconnected to \( w \).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that edge-biconnectedness is in fact an equivalence relation. The proofs for these properties are definitely doable to do for yourself! (Try this! Or look at the proof for the first property and then try the other two yourself. For transitivity, you have to consider that the two assumed paths can be overlapping.) Regardless, I will give the proof here, together with a "proof by picture":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reflexivity: let \( u \) be any node. Obviously no matter what edge we remove, we still have a path from \( u \) going to itself, namely the empty path. Therefore, \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( u \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symmetry: let \( u \) and \( v \) be any nodes, assume that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \), and let \( e \) be any edge that we must not use. Because \( u \) was edge-biconnected to \( v \), we can choose \( p \) to be the path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use \( e \). Because this path lives in an undirected graph, we can reverse the path to get a path from \( v \) to \( u \) that still does not use \( e \). Therefore, \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( u \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transitivity: let \( u \), \( v \) and \( w \) be any nodes, assume that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \) and that \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \), and let \( e \) be any edge that we must not use. Because \( u \) was edge-biconnected to \( v \), we can choose \( p \) to be the path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use \( e \). Because \( v \) was edge-biconnected to \( w \), we can choose \( q \) to be the path from \( v \) to \( w \). If \( p \) and \( q \) do not overlap in any edges, simply concatenate to get a path \( p q \) from \( u \) to \( w \). If they do however overlap at some point, take the subpath \( p' \) of \( p \) from \( u \) to the earliest point where the overlap, take the subpath \( q' \) of \( q \) from that point to \( w \), and concatenate to get a path \( p' q' \) from \( u \) to \( w \) that does not use \( e \) and does not overlap with itself. Therefore in either case, \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \). (See figure.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: \( e \) marks the sabotaged edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: path from \( u \) to \( v \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: path from \( v \) to \( w \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: red marks the first overlapping node of the two paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: concatenated path from \( u \) to \( w \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us a new algorithm for our problem. First compute the edge-biconnected components for the entire graph. Then within each component count how many \( A \) nodes and how many \( B \) nodes there are. Because within a component each pair of nodes is edge-biconnected, we can simply multiply the A count by the B count and add this value to the result. Between any two different components there are no edge-biconnected pairs, we are not missing any pairs. Now all we need is an algorithm for computing edge-biconnected components!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tarjan's Algorithm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As could be seen in the example of our connected-component-based algorithm, there are certain edges that, when removed, will split up the graph into more connected components. These edges are called bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definition: an edge \( \{ u, v \} \) is a bridge if there is no path between \( u \) and \( v \) in \( G - \{ u, v \} \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can find the bridges of the graph, then finding the edge-biconnected components will be very easy, because they are simply the connected components of the graph with all bridges removed. This follows from the following lemma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 1: two nodes are edge-biconnected if and only if they are in the same connected component of the graph with all bridges removed. (See the appendix for the proof, which is safe to skip.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm for finding bridges was invented by famous computer scientist Robert Tarjan and only uses depth-first search. (Fun fact: Tarjan's brother James is a chess grandmaster.) Let's look at the first observation that makes this algorithm works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 2: an edge \( e \) is a bridge if and only if there does not exist a simple cycle that goes through \( e \). (See the appendix for the proof, which is safe to skip.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can check this condition for all edges by performing a DFS and looking at the back-edges of the DFS tree. For instance, this is what a DFS tree looks like for the example if we start at node 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A possible DFS tree. Filled arrows are tree-edges and dotted arrows are back-edges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that back edges are always part of a cycle. Thus, we can make the following two observations about the connection between bridges, by using lemma 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: a back edge is never a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: a tree edge \( (u, v) \) is a bridge if and only if none of the descendants of \( v \) has a back edge to an ancestor of \( u \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tarjan's algorithm maintains for every node a \( \mathit{low} \) value, which is the minimum between (1) the DFS entry time of the node itself, (2) the entry times of all back-edge neighbors, and (3) the \( \mathit{low} \) values of the children. Then a tree edge \( (u, v) \) is a bridge if and only if \( low[v] \) is strictly greater than the entry time of \( u \). Essentially, this means that when the algorithm visits a back edge \( (u, v) \), all of the tree edges between \( v \) and \( u \) are marked as not being a bridge as soon as we go back up the DFS tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step through the example below. I have made the graph such that the DFS entry time matches the node labels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All nodes start with \( \mathit{low} \) equal to the DFS entry time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (1, 2) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (2, 3) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit back edge \( (3, 1) \): update \( \mathit{low}[3] := \min(\mathit{low}[3], 1) \). All tree edges shown in red thus cannot be bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (3, 4) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit back edge \( (4, 1) \): update \( \mathit{low}[4] := \min(\mathit{low}[4], 1) \). All tree edges shown in red thus cannot be bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (4, 5) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Node 5 has no children, so \( \mathit{low}[5] = 5 \). Since \( \mathit{low}[5] &amp;gt; 4 \), the edge is a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (4, 6) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (6, 7) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (7, 8) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit back edge \( (8, 6) \): update \( \mathit{low}[8] := \min(\mathit{low}[8], 6) \). All tree edges shown in red thus cannot be bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So \( \mathit{low}[8] = 6 \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[7] := \min(\mathit{low}[7], \mathit{low}[8]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[6] := \min(\mathit{low}[6], \mathit{low}[7]) \). Since \( \mathit{low}[6] &amp;gt; 4 \), the edge is a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[4] := \min(\mathit{low}[4], \mathit{low}[6]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[3] := \min(\mathit{low}[3], \mathit{low}[4]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[2] := \min(\mathit{low}[2], \mathit{low}[3]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[1] := \min(\mathit{low}[1], \mathit{low}[2]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the algorithm finds the bridges, and even appears to identify edge-biconnected components. It can be modified to find the edge-biconnected components and even articulation points (which is a concept related to vertex-biconnectedness) in a single pass, but understanding and proving why this works is quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the algorithm only performs a DFS and maintains some integers associated with the nodes, it has a time complexity of \( O(|V| + |E|) \) and a space complexity of \( O(|V|) \) (assuming the graph space usage itself is not counted).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can solve the original metro problem. The full code is available on this website. I also have code that computes the edge-biconnected components without the metro stuff and that also works for non-simple graphs (with self loops or multi-edges), which I tested on judge.yosupo.jp. All code is licensed under GPL3 (see the COPYING file).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; First we set up the graph data structure and implement the bridge-finding algorithm. The nodes keep track of the \( \mathit{low} \) value and whether they are in the A and/or B set. Tarjan's algorithm performs a standard DFS and computes the \( \mathit{low} \) value for each node, and puts an edge in the &lt;code&gt;bridges&lt;/code&gt; set if it meets
                the condition given in the previous section.
            &lt;/p&gt;

        dfs(graph, i, -1, time, bridges);
    }
    return bridges;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we have another DFS procedure which, given a node \( i \), computes the number of A nodes and B nodes within the edge-biconnected component that it lies in. It does this by never passing through bridges, meaning it will not go to another edge-biconnected component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
std::pair&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt; countAB(

    if (graph[i].isA) result.first++;
    if (graph[i].isB) result.second++;
    for (int j : graph[i].adj) {
        // don't traverse bridges (act like they are removed from the graph)
        if (bridges.count({i, j})) continue;
        auto abCount = countAB(graph, j, bridges);
        result.first += abCount.first;
        result.second += abCount.second;
    }
    return result;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have some code that reads the graph and the set of A and B nodes. It runs the two DFS passes above for the whole graph. For each edge-biconnected component, it adds the product of the number of A nodes and B nodes, because that is how many \( (a, b ) \) pairs you can find within an edge-biconnected component that Eve cannot sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

        int v;
        std::cin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; v;
        graph[v - 1].isA = true;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; b; i++) {
        int v;
        std::cin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; v;
        graph[v - 1].isB = true;
    }

    auto bridges = getBridges(graph);

    for (auto&amp;amp; node : graph) node.visited = false;

    // go over each edge-biconnected component and count A and B nodes
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {
        if (graph[i].visited) continue;
        auto abCount = countAB(graph, i, bridges);
        result += abCount.first * abCount.second;
    }
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; result &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "\n";

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The input format is as follows. The first line is \( n, m, a, b \), which are the number of nodes, the number of edges, the number of A nodes, and the number of B nodes respectively. Then follow \( m \) lines of pairs \( v~w \), which are the edges. It is assumed that the graph is simple. Then follow \( a \) lines of integers, which are the A nodes, and then \( b \) lines of integers, which are the B nodes. All nodes in the input are 1-based. There is an example input available that encodes the graph we've been using as an example, for which the code gives the correct answer 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus 1: Edge-Disjoint Paths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to state the edge-biconnectedness property is that there exist two edge-disjoint paths from \( a \) to \( b \), i.e., paths that do not have any of the same edges. For instance, in the example there are two edge-disjoint paths from node 2 to 1: one that goes from 2 directly to 1, and one that goes from 2 through 3 to 1. However, there are no two edge-disjoint paths from node 5 to 7: any path must go through the same edge \( \{ 4, 6 \} \), so we cannot choose two paths to be fully edge-disjoint. The proof that this is a property that holds if and only if the nodes are edge-biconnected is not trivial. You can see the picture for an example that we have two edge-disjoint paths for each edge-biconnected pair, but not for any other pairs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (2, 1) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (4, 1) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (5, 5) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (6, 6) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (6, 7) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (8, 6) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (8, 7) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note that in an undirected graph, we can see two edge-disjoint paths from \( a \) to \( b \) as an edge walk that goes from \( a \) to \( b \) and then back to \( a \) again, without repeating any edges. This is kind of like a cycle going through \( a \) and \( b \), except we may go over the same node several times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus 2: Vertex-Biconnected Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can repeat the problem that we stated before but change one thing: what if after you pick a station for Alice and one for Bob, Eve sabotages a metro station instead of a metro line? (She would not be able to sabotage the metro station that Alice or Bob was in.) Do we still have an equivalence relation on the nodes like with edge-biconnectedness? I will not discuss it in this article, but consider the following example and think about if the transitivity property holds for vertex-biconnectedness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will also leave you with a hint: a node can be part of multiple vertex-biconnected components. Consider instead an equivalence relation on the edges (it's a cute little symmetry that edge-biconnectedness gives an equivalence relation on the vertices, and vertex-biconnectedness gives an equivalence relation on the edges).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: List of Relevant Terms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of terms used in the theory for edge-biconnectedness and vertex-biconnectedness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edge-biconnectedness (for pairs of nodes): a node \( u \) is edge-biconnected to a node \( v \) if for any edge \( e \), we can find a path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not go through \( e \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edge-biconnectedness (for whole undirected graphs): a graph is edge-biconnected if the graph is connected even if any one edge is removed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edge-biconnected components: a subset of nodes forms an edge-biconnected component if each pair of nodes within it is edge-biconnected, and it cannot have any additional nodes added to it and still have this property. (The edge-biconnected components of any graph are the equivalence classes of the edge-biconnectedness equivalence relation.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bridge: an edge is a bridge if, when removed, the number of connected components is increased (in the example graph there are two such edges, which you can see by stepping through the second figure).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vertex-biconnectedness (for pairs of nodes): a node \( u \) is vertex-biconnected to a node \( v \) if there exist two vertex-disjoint paths from \( u \) to \( v \), or \( u = v \). (Note that this is not an equivalence relation.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vertex-biconnectedness (for whole undirected graphs): a graph is vertex-biconnected if the graph is connected even if any one node is removed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vertex-biconnected component: a subset of nodes forms a vertex-biconnected component if each pair of nodes within it is vertex-biconnected, and it cannot have any additional nodes added to it and still have this property. (Note that the vertex-biconnected components of a graph are not necessarily a partition of the nodes.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Articulation point: a node is an articulation point if it is part of more than one vertex-biconnected component.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: Proof of Connection Between Edge-Biconnectedness and Bridges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 1: for any undirected graph \( G \), for any two nodes \( u, v \in V(G) \), \( u \) and \( v \) are edge-biconnected if and only if \( u \) and \( v \) are in the same connected component of \( G \) with all bridges removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proof. For convenience, define \( G' \) to be \( G \) with all bridges removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Rightarrow) \) Assume \( u \) and \( v \) are edge-biconnected. For a contradiction, suppose \( u \) and \( v \) are not in the same connected component of \( G' \), i.e., all paths from \( u \) to \( v \) go through some bridge in \( G \). Since edge-biconnectedness implies connectedness, there must exist at least one path \( p \) between them in \( G \), and choose \( e \) to be a bridge that this path goes through. From edge-biconnectedness, we can instead choose a path \( q \) that does not go through \( e \). Choose \( C \) to be the first connected component of \( G' \) that \( q \) passes through and that \( p \) also goes through, and that is not just the connected component that \( u \) lies in (we know such a connected component must exist, because \( p \) and \( q \) at least meet in the component of \( v \) in \( G' \), and that component is separate from the component of \( u \) because we passed through the bridge \( e \)). We can join up these paths \( p \) and \( q \) in that connected component through edges that are not bridges. Now we have a cycle passing through a bridge, which is a contradiction because it implies that both endpoints of the bridge are in the same connected component even if \( e \) was removed (see also lemma 2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Leftarrow) \) Assume \( u \) and \( v \) are in the same connected component of \( G' \). To prove their edge-biconnectedness, let \( e \) be any edge. If \( e \) is a bridge or lies outside of the connected component of \( u \) and \( v \), then trivially there exists a path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use \( e \). Otherwise, \( e \) must not be a bridge and that means that removing it from \( G \) does not change what vertices are connected to each other, i.e., \( u \) and \( v \) would still lie in the same connected component in \( G - e \). This means there exists a path from \( u \) to \( v \) in \( G - e \) and thus there exists a path in \( G \) that does not use \( e \) going from \( u \) to \( v \). Either way, we have a path from \( u \) to \( v \), proving that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: Proof of Connection Between Bridges and Simple Cycles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 2: an edge \( \{ u, v \} \) is a bridge if and only if all simple cycles do not go through \( \{ u, v \} \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proof. For convenience, define \( G' := G - \{ u, v \} \) to be the graph with the edge removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Rightarrow) \) Let \( \{ u, v \} \) be a bridge and let \( c \) be a simple cycle in \( G \), and assume for a contradiction that \( c \) goes through \( \{ u, v \} \). Then we can remove the edge \( \{ u, v \} \) from the cycle and still have a path between \( u \) and \( v \) in \( G' \). This directly contradicts the assumption that \( \{ u, v \} \) was a bridge.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Leftarrow) \) Let \( \{ u, v \} \) be an edge through which all simple cycles do not pass. For a contradiction, suppose that \( \{ u, v \} \) was not a bridge and thus \( u \) and \( v \) are still connected in \( G' \) and thus there exists a path \( \{ v, v_1 \}, ..., \{ v_n, u \} \) in \( G' \). Since \( \{ u, v \} \) is an edge in \( G \), we can connect the two ends of the path and get a simple cycle in \( G \) that passes through \( \{ u, v \} \). This contradicts the assumption.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Go has a feature called struct embedding that allows you to compose types. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Position struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

type Colour struct {
	R byte
	G byte
	B byte
}

type Rectangle struct {
	Position
	Colour
	
	Width  int
	Height int
}

r := Rectangle{/* ... */}

// This works:
fmt.Printf("%d,%d\n", r.Position.X, r.Position.Y)

// but so does this:
fmt.Printf("%d,%d\n", r.X, r.Y)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what do you think this code does?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type FooService struct {
	URL string
}

type BarConnectionOptions struct {
	URL string
}

type BarService struct {
	BarConnectionOptions
}

type Options struct {
	FooService
	BarService
}

opts := Options{
	FooService: FooService{URL: "abc.com"},
	BarService: BarService{
		BarConnectionOptions: BarConnectionOptions{
			URL: "xyz.com",
		},
	},
}

fmt.Println(opts.URL)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would expect this to fail to compile as &lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; is ambiguous. It actually prints &lt;code&gt;abc.com&lt;/code&gt;, presumably as it is the least nested version of that field. This happened at the day job, although it was caught in a test. Be careful when embedding structs!&lt;/p&gt;

We focus on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty, and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate. Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33 participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers) forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling applications that better navigate complex social interactions.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I, a non-developer, read the tutorial you, a developer, wrote for me, a beginner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hello! I am a developer. Here is my relevant experience: I code in Hoobijag and sometimes jabbernocks and of course ABCDE++++ (but never ABCDE+/^+ are you kidding? ha!) and I like working with Shoobababoo and occasionally kleptomitrons. I’ve gotten to work for Company1 doing Shoobaboo-ing code things and that’s what led me to the Snarfus. So, let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About this tutorial&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first started doing Very Simple Thing2 with Snarfus, but the more I used it the more I saw the potential! Despite the jaggle of the chromus, it’s really multi-purpose. And that’s what led me to argyling the pintafore with the quagmire instead of the hoobastank! I know, crazy. But it was kind of working, and actually a lot of fun… Until I hit a big roadblock: the fisterfunk will NOT talk to the shamrock portal or even send beep-boops back to the Snarfus! Of course, you know what that means3 — Now the entire hoob-tunnel is clogged with gramelions. Unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I almost gave up but then I realized: If I connect the backside Snarfus stagnator to the backside shamrock Klingon troglodyte emulater, it’s good! Everything beep-boops and ding-dongs and I get the Actual Topic of the Tutorial, which lets me do the Very Simple Thing the way I want after all! Pretty cool4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s how to set it up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the terminal, ajkl;gawgor;iqeg;iJLkqen. wl;R aw;oeiga 4648664 arjarwgj;llj;ja fadgfgajkljl; wlj;sdjk;lfas&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next go to folder/hidden/deep/in/the/file/system/surprise!.file and copy the contents of the file. If it’s not there, it might be in library/library/library/llibrary/liiiiiibrarrrary/llllliiiiibrary/hidden/hidden/hiding/you can’t find me/hidden/nope/never/hahahahereiam.file.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now go back to the terminal and paste in the file contents, then type in 64A786AGR45JAR; rdja;jg [[]][[]][[]][[]]][[]()()()()()()()()(){{}{}{}|{}{|}{}{|}{ ////////////////!! !!!! !! //// !!! agjlkargji;lwej;OI [ASRGASG[]ASGDASG[]EAEadgasg[]EAGE[edaga][]ahgr-0-0=-0-=0-=0=0-0=-0-=0=-0-=0=-0=-0!!!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Boop!5&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Open Snarfus and upload the file you just made.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just for shits and giggles, you can de-sham the chronostatiomatrix by running —()()(]]asdg a=-do —cd go cd stay —sususudododo baby shark—][] but that’s optional.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know how it goes for you. I’d love to hear if anybody uses this approach with GewGawGamma or ometer2.7.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I probably should recognize Company because it seems illustrious but I do not recognize Company or know what they do. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is not simple. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I do not know what that means. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is cool. I don’t really understand how, but I believe it. I’m glad you know how to do it. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first 3 steps will take me approximately 7 hours and 193 internet searches to complete. When I finally get to Boop! it will be really satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is meant in good fun. I really appreciate the folks who take time to share their knowledge and write up tutorials and give tips and so on. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;10.09.2025 | Frederik Ramm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we’ve ramped up the infrastructure behind the download server, and downloads should now be available earlier&lt;lb/&gt; and faster. There’s also a small technical change in that requests for a “…latest” file will now be answered with a&lt;lb/&gt; HTTP redirect to the specific latest version (see previous blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to users of the download server to “download responsibly”. We want&lt;lb/&gt; to continue offering this service as powerful and as convenient as possible within our means. We want everyone&lt;lb/&gt; to have easy access to the latest OSM data in a form that is useful to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every now and then, people break things for others. There have been individual clients downloading the exact same&lt;lb/&gt; 20-GB file 100s of times per day, for several days in a row. (Just the other day, one user has managed to download almost 10,000 copies of the italy-latest.osm.pbf file in 24 hours!) Others download every single file we have on the&lt;lb/&gt; server, every day. There’s a limit to the outgoing network bandwidth, and behaviour like this means that&lt;lb/&gt; things are slowing down for everyone. Also, when we block an IP range for abuse, innocent third parties can be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s three concrete appeals to users of the download server:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;SGI demos from long ago, running in your browser today.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old problems require modern solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the original SGI demo source code, compiled for the web using Emscripten and SDL2. Rendering is done using an IRIS GL software rasterizer from the Alice 4 project. Event handling is done by SDL2, with events translated into GL's event system. Each demo is a separate web page, with its own Javascript + WASM compiled by Emscripten from the original C/C++ source. Minimal modifications have been made to the original source, in order to run in the browser and to work with compilers 35 years newer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flight (cockpit glitches, planes too slow in web version, night mode 'shimmers', no network play)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Newave (no mesh editing, no popup menus, only wireframe)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arena (no network play)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install Homebrew if you don't have it, then get SDL2 and Emscripten:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;brew install SDL2
brew install emscripten&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/sgi-demos/sgi-demos.git
cd sgi-demos
make&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install Winget if you don't have it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install MSYS2 from cmd.exe, in order to get the clang compiler:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;winget install MSYS2.MSYS2
setx PATH "%PATH%C:\msys64\clang64\bin"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install clang toolchain and SDL2 in MSYS2 CLANG64 shell:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu
pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-SDL2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clone emscripten from Github. Cloning seems to work best with MSYS2 rather than using pacman. Follow the default install directions, not the Windows directions!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this line to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;file in MSYS2 CLANG64 shell:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Rendering via OpenGLES/WebGL (WIP)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arbitrary window size&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run GL demo in its own WASM worker/thread, to avoid slicing up the code for SDL's event loop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Popup menus, including the classic SGI menu font&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More demos, all the demos. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Electropaint, Cedit, any other IRIS GL demos I can find&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then OpenGL, GLUT, Inventor, Performer demos in no particular order&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rudimentary context for each demo: name, author, year (as text in lower corner), code link&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Virtual mouse and keyboard: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Only display virtual keys and mouse functions used by the demo; use demo's qdevice() calls to determine this&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Displayed as transparent virtual mouse and key pictures overlaid on demo&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;On always for touch devices&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;On/off for mouse/keyboard devices, as hints&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Description/history/context for each demo - can obtain some descriptions from .Info slide files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Man page live links&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Everyone who worked at SGI, for the eye candy and the baller computers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Alice 4 folks, for the inspiration and the GL implementation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emscripten and SDL teams, for making a web port possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internet Archive, Bitsavers, WinWorld, IRIXNet, and others, for saving the history.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is preparing to switch on generative-AI training that draws from European members’ data, setting November 3, 2025 as the go-live date. The company says it will rely on “legitimate interests” as its legal basis and will offer an opt-out so members can refuse use of their data for training—promising that private messages are excluded. The change applies across the EU/EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a pivot from last year’s pause. In September 2024, after criticism and scrutiny, LinkedIn suspended plans to train models on data from EU &amp;amp; U.K. users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What exactly will be used? LinkedIn’s help center explains that profile details and public content (posts, articles, comments) can feed content-generating models. The company also points to saved résumés and job-application answers as potential inputs to features that help members get discovered by recruiters, and it says it screens out minors it believes are in secondary school. It stresses that private messages are not part of the training set. The togglable setting appears as “Data for Generative AI Improvement,” and turning it off stops future use of your data for training, though it doesn’t unwind models already trained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a parallel—but separate—data-sharing change with Microsoft, LinkedIn’s parent. Beginning November 3, LinkedIn will expand, in some regions, the types of LinkedIn data shared with Microsoft so Microsoft can personalize ads. LinkedIn frames this as an “Affiliates” update; it says it will provide an additional opt-out where relevant. The two changes arrive together in the same terms refresh but follow different regional rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Outside EU/EEA/Switzerland and the UK, LinkedIn shares your information with our affiliate, Microsoft, for advertising purposes and with select partners for purposes of marketing LinkedIn’s products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For European members, the legal hinge is GDPR’s “legitimate interests.” That route allows processing without consent if a company can show necessity, transparency, and an effective right to object. LinkedIn’s European Regional Privacy Notice update states that legitimate interests will be the basis for training content-generating models starting November 3, and that an objection (opt-out) will be honored via account settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why now? LinkedIn has steadily added AI-assisted features—writing suggestions, profile summaries, recruiter tools—that benefit from domain-specific training. After the 2024 backlash (and a short-lived lawsuit in the U.S. that centered on fears about private messages—claims LinkedIn denied and that were later withdrawn), the company has come back with region-specific notices, a single, named training setting, and clearer language that private messages aren’t in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practically, here’s what changes on (or around) November 3 in Europe: if you do nothing, LinkedIn may use parts of your profile and public activity to refine the models behind its content-generation features. If you object in settings, that use should stop for future training. Your ability to use AI features doesn’t depend on opting in. In parallel, some—but not all—regions will see broader ad-personalization data sharing with Microsoft, governed by a separate control. Expect some differences in labels and availability by market; LinkedIn says not all features and settings roll out worldwide at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want out, the setting to look for is “Data for Generative AI Improvement” in Settings → Data privacy. The key is that the toggle affects future training, not models already built. Keep an eye out for any region-specific notices in your account banner over the next few weeks as the company aligns the U.K. with the EU schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The European Union is pushing a dangerous surveillance law called “Chat Control” that would force tech companies to scan everyone’s private messages — even those protected by end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal would force tech companies to use “client-side scanning” — so your private messages, photos, and files could be read before you send them, opening the door for hackers, corporations, and governments to spy on your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If passed, Chat Control won’t just weaken privacy — it will change the way we live online. Private conversations would no longer be private. Trust, security, and freedom on the internet would vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mozilla community is urgently calling on EU policymakers to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Protect encryption: Ensure that end-to-end encrypted services are fully excluded from any broad detection requirements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Defend online security: Reject all measures that weaken encryption, violate the integrity of our devices or create new vulnerabilities in digital services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rely on expertise: Consult independent experts — cryptographers, child protection specialists, and fundamental rights advocates — to design solutions that are both technically sound and proportionate.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign Mozilla Foundation’s petition today to tell the EU: Drop Chat Control. Defend encryption. Protect our digital future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Check this map to see where your country stands: fightchatcontrol.eu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each EU country has taken a different stance — and the debate is shifting fast. Some governments oppose it, some are undecided, and others are pushing hard to pass it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter your government’s position right now, adding your voice will help protect our right to private communications. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and national ministers will decide this law. Contact your representatives today and tell them: protect encryption, reject client-side scanning, and defend our rights online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="tw-list-none [&amp;amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:tw-hidden tw-w-full tw-text-lg tw-leading-7 tw-min-h-40 py-3 d-flex align-items-center tw-border-t-gray-20 tw-border-t"&gt;What is “client-side scanning” (CSS)?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Client-side scanning means your messages, photos, or files are scanned on your device before they’re encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Client-side scanning (CSS) is often promoted as a child safety measure — but in reality, it undermines the very promise of encryption. Detection tools, especially those meant to identify “unknown” content, are error-prone and create new security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if scanning starts with one type of content (like CSAM), it sets a dangerous precedent: the scope can easily be expanded to monitor other kinds of conversations. And once encryption is weakened, the risks multiply — hackers can steal sensitive data, abusers can track vulnerable people, and authoritarian regimes can spy on journalists, activists, and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS doesn’t make people safer. It makes everyone less secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="tw-list-none [&amp;amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:tw-hidden tw-w-full tw-text-lg tw-leading-7 tw-min-h-40 py-3 d-flex align-items-center tw-border-t-gray-20 tw-border-t"&gt;Which encrypted apps and products would be impacted?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If passed, Chat Control would apply to messaging and storage services operating in the EU — even those using end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, iMessage, and Messenger, plus cloud services like iCloud, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive, could all be forced to scan your private messages, photos, and files before they’re sent or stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means no matter which service you use, your conversations and data could be opened up to surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind has found that Kmart Australia Limited (Kmart) breached Australians’ privacy by collecting their personal and sensitive information through a facial recognition technology (FRT) system designed to tackle refund fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between June 2020 and July 2022, Kmart deployed FRT to capture the faces of every person who entered 28 of its retail stores, and all individuals who presented at a returns counter, in an attempt to identify people committing refund fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a determination published today, the Privacy Commissioner found that Kmart did not notify shoppers or seek their consent to use FRT to collect their biometric information, which is sensitive personal information and enjoys higher protections under the Privacy Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The retailer argued that it was not required to obtain consent because of an exemption in the Privacy Act that applies when organisations reasonably believe that they need to collect personal information to tackle unlawful activity or serious misconduct. The Privacy Commissioner’s determination focused on assessing whether Kmart met the conditions for relying on the exemption, and concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The sensitive biometric information of every individual who entered a store was indiscriminately collected by the FRT system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There were other less privacy intrusive methods available to Kmart to address refund fraud.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deploying the FRT system to prevent fraud was of limited utility.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Considering that the FRT system impacted on the privacy of many thousands of individuals not suspected of refund fraud, the collection of biometric information on Kmart customers was a disproportionate interference with privacy.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Understanding how FRT accords with the protections contained in Privacy Act requires me to balance the interests of individuals in having their privacy protected, on the one hand, and the interests of entities in carrying out their functions or activities, on the other. Relevant to a technology like facial recognition, is also the public interest in protecting privacy,” the Privacy Commissioner said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relevant factors considered by the Commissioner included the estimated value of fraudulent returns against the respondent’s total operations and profits, the limited effectiveness of the FRT system, and the extent of the privacy impacts in collecting the sensitive information of every individual who entered the relevant stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I do not consider that the respondent (Kmart) could have reasonably believed that the benefits of the FRT system in addressing refund fraud proportionately outweighed the impact on individuals’ privacy,” the Commissioner stated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determination is the second issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) on the use of FRT in retail settings. In October 2024, the Privacy Commissioner found that Bunnings Group Limited had contravened Australians’ privacy through their use of FRT in 62 of its retail stores across Australia. That decision is currently under review by the Administrative Review Tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These two decisions do not impose a ban on the use of FRT. The human rights to safety and privacy are not mutually exclusive; rather, both must be preserved, upheld and promoted. Customer and staff safety, and fraud prevention and detection, are legitimate reasons businesses might have regard to when considering the deployment of new technologies. However, these reasons are not, in and of themselves, a free pass to avoid compliance with the Privacy Act,” she stated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commissioner’s determination is instructive for entities that are considering new technologies such as FRT. Privacy considerations should be a key feature. The OAIC has also published guidance on its website: Facial recognition technology: a guide to assessing the privacy risks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kmart has been under investigation by the OAIC since July 2022, at which time it ceased operating the FRT system. It has cooperated with the OAIC throughout the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the Privacy Commissioner reached a similar conclusion in the Kmart and Bunnings decisions, the cases differ considerably and focus on different uses of FRT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Privacy Act is technology-neutral and does not proscribe the use of any particular technology. When considering the roll-out and use of new technologies such as FRT, the OAIC’s guidance encourages entities to consider factors such as proportionality, transparency, the risk of bias and discrimination, and governance for the collection, use and retention of sensitive personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commissioner Kind has published a blog post with further takeaways for other retailers considering using FRT.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A duo of Tesla shareholder-influencers tried to complete Elon Musk’s coast-to-coast self-driving ride that he claimed Tesla would be able to do in 2017 and they crashed before making it about 60 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2016, Elon Musk infamously said that Tesla would complete a fully self-driving coast-to-coast drive between Los Angeles and New York by the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea was to livestream or film a full unedited drive coast-to-coast with the vehicle driving itself at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are in 2025 and Tesla never made that drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the many missed autonomous driving goals, many Tesla shareholders believe that the company is on the verge of delivering unsupervised self-driving following the rollout of its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in Austin, which requires supervision from Tesla employees inside the vehicles, and improvements to its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) systems inside consumer vehicles, which is still only a level 2 driver assist system that requires driver attention at all times as per Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two of these Tesla shareholders and online influencers attempted to undertake a coast-to-coast drive between San Diego, CA, and Jacksonville, FL, in a Tesla Model Y equipped with the latest FSD software update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They didn’t make it out of California without crashing into easily avoidable road debris that badly damaged the Tesla Model Y:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the video, you can see that the driver doesn’t have his hands on the steering wheel. The passenger spots the debris way ahead of time. There was plenty of time to react, but the driver didn’t get his hands on the steering wheel until the last second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up video, the two Tesla influencers confirmed that the Model Y had a broken sway bar bracket and damaged suspension components. The vehicle is also throwing out a lot of warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They made it about 2.5% of the planned trip on Tesla FSD v13.9 before crashing the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla shareholders used to discuss this somewhat rationally back in the day, but now that Tesla’s EV business is in decline and the stock price depends entirely on the self-driving and robot promises, they no longer do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recall when Musk himself used to say that when you reach 99% self-driving, it is when the “march of the 9s” begins, and you must achieve 99.999999999% autonomy to have a truly useful self-driving system. He admitted that this is the most challenging part as the real-world is unpredictable and hard to simulate – throwing a lot of challenging scenario at you, such as debris on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where Tesla is right now. The hard part has just started. And there’s no telling how long it will take to get there. If someone is telling you that they know, they are lying. I don’t know. My best estimate is approximately 2-3 years and a new hardware suite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, competition, mainly Waymo, began its own “march of the 9s” about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla is still years behind, and something like this drive by these two Tesla influencers proves it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by HBrown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't get why there is so much criticism of the youtubers in these comments. Instead of blindly believing Elon's claims that FSD is right around the corner, they actually took the time and effort to conduct a significant real world test. And then when things did not turn out well for the Tesla, they were still honest enough to put the video on youtube. The showed both the full incident and the aftermath. It seemed rather rational and evenhanded to me. I wish all Tesla and Elon fans acted in such a manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was actually in a similar accident in a Tesla Model 3 back in 2020. I rented a Model 3 on Turo for a trip to Las Vegas from Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up driving over a blown-out truck tire in the middle of the road like this. I was Autopilot, but I don’t know if the car saw it. I definitely saw it, but it was a bit late as I was following a truck that just drove over it. I had probably less than 2 seconds to react. I applied the brakes, but my choices were driving into a ditch on the right or into a car in the left lane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I managed to reduce the force of the impact with the braking, but the vehicle jumped a bit like in this video. There wasn’t really any damage to the front, but the bottom cover was flapping down. I taped it together at the next gas station and I was able to continue the trip without much issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, after returning it to the Turo owner and having the suspension damage evaluated by Tesla, the repair job was estimated to be roughly $10,000. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a similar situation with this accident.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Nick Morgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a language unlike most others. It’s not functional or object oriented, it doesn’t have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but is still used today for certain applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If you’re a Forth expert, please contribute here and make it better!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together, typing &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the interpreter, typing &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; after each line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1
2
3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time you type a line followed by the &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string &lt;code&gt;ok&lt;/code&gt; to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, into the same interpreter, type a single &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; followed by the &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; key. The top two
elements on the stack, &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, have been replaced by &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, your editor window should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; again and press &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only one element on the stack! This results in a
&lt;code&gt;Stack underflow&lt;/code&gt; error:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the following into the next editor, followed by the &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; key:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;123 456 +
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stack should now look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as Reverse-Polish notation. Let’s try something a bit more complicated, and calculate &lt;code&gt;10 * (5 + 2)&lt;/code&gt;. Type the
following into the interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;5 2 + 10 *
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing &lt;code&gt;5
2 + 10 *&lt;/code&gt;, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack, some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form &lt;code&gt;( before -- after
)&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;( n1 n2 -- sum )&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;n1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;n2&lt;/code&gt; are the top two numbers
on the stack, and &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; is the value left on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a number, an error occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try that out yourself below. Type &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;foo ?&lt;/code&gt; means that Forth was unable to find a definition for &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, and it
wasn’t a valid number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can create our own definition of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; using two special words called &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;
(colon) and &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; (semicolon).  &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: A common mistake is to miss out the space before the &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, &lt;code&gt;+;&lt;/code&gt; is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you’ve hopefully figured out, our &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First, let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dup ( n -- n n )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dup&lt;/code&gt; is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 2 3 dup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should end up with the following stack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop ( n -- )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt; simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 2 3 drop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;gives you a stack of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt;, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 2 3 4 swap
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;will give you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;over&lt;/code&gt; is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 2 3 over
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;will result in this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;rot&lt;/code&gt; “rotates” the top three elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 2 3 rot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;gives you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;. ( n -- )&lt;/code&gt; (period)&lt;p&gt;The simplest output word in Forth is &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;. You can use &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going through this in order, we push &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;. Next we push &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;emit ( c -- )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;emit&lt;/code&gt; can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; outputs
the number at the top of the stack, &lt;code&gt;emit&lt;/code&gt; outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt; 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be written as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;emit&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cr ( -- )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cr&lt;/code&gt; is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;." ( -- )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we have &lt;code&gt;."&lt;/code&gt; – a special word for outputting strings. The &lt;code&gt;."&lt;/code&gt; word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. &lt;code&gt;."&lt;/code&gt; marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;. The closing &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see the following output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can combine &lt;code&gt;."&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cr&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;emit&lt;/code&gt; to build up more complex output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running this should give you the following output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work, however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; (all
boolean operators return &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test if two numbers are equal, you can use &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 4 = .
5 5 = .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for less than and greater than. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 4 &amp;lt; .
3 4 &amp;gt; .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;invert&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 4 &amp;lt; 20 30 &amp;lt; and .
3 4 &amp;lt; 20 30 &amp;gt; or .
3 4 &amp;lt; invert .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first line is the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;3 &amp;lt; 4 &amp;amp; 20 &amp;lt; 30&lt;/code&gt; in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;3 &amp;lt; 4 | 20 &amp;gt; 30&lt;/code&gt;. The third line is the
equivalent of &lt;code&gt;!(3 &amp;lt; 4)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;invert&lt;/code&gt; are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if then&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is &lt;code&gt;if
then&lt;/code&gt;, which is equivalent to a standard &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using &lt;code&gt;if then&lt;/code&gt;. In this example, we’re also
using the &lt;code&gt;mod&lt;/code&gt; word, which returns the modulo of the top two numbers on the
stack. In this case, the top number is 5, and the other is whatever was placed
on the stack before calling &lt;code&gt;buzz?&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;5 mod 0 =&lt;/code&gt; is a boolean
expression that checks to see if the top of the stack is divisible by 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: buzz?  5 mod 0 = if ." Buzz" then ;
3 buzz?
4 buzz?
5 buzz?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; word marks the end of the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.
This makes it equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fi&lt;/code&gt; in Bash or &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; in Ruby, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to realize is that &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; consumes the top value on the
stack when it checks to see if it’s true or false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if else then&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if else then&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to an &lt;code&gt;if/else&lt;/code&gt; statement in most languages. Here’s
an example of its use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: is-it-zero?  0 = if ." Yes!" else ." No!" then ;
0 is-it-zero?
1 is-it-zero?
2 is-it-zero?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This outputs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the if clause (consequent) is everything between &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;,
and the else clause (alternative) is everything between &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;do loop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;do loop&lt;/code&gt; in Forth most closely resembles a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop in most C-based languages.
In the body of a &lt;code&gt;do loop&lt;/code&gt;, the special word &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; pushes the current loop index
onto the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top two values on the stack give the starting value (inclusive) and ending value (exclusive) for the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; value. The starting value is taken from the top
of the stack. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: loop-test  10 0 do i . loop ;
loop-test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression &lt;code&gt;10 0 do i . loop&lt;/code&gt; is roughly equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i++) {
  print(i);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can write the classic Fizz Buzz program easily using a &lt;code&gt;do loop&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: fizz?  3 mod 0 = dup if ." Fizz" then ;
: buzz?  5 mod 0 = dup if ." Buzz" then ;
: fizz-buzz?  dup fizz? swap buzz? or invert ;
: do-fizz-buzz  25 1 do cr i fizz-buzz? if i . then loop ;
do-fizz-buzz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fizz?&lt;/code&gt; checks to see if the top of the stack is divisible by 3 using &lt;code&gt;3 mod 0
=&lt;/code&gt;. It then uses &lt;code&gt;dup&lt;/code&gt; to duplicate this result. The top copy of the value is
consumed by &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.  The second copy is left on the stack and acts as the return
value of &lt;code&gt;fizz?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the number on top of the stack is divisible by 3, the string &lt;code&gt;"Fizz"&lt;/code&gt; will
be output, otherwise there will be no output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;buzz?&lt;/code&gt; does the same thing but with 5, and outputs the string &lt;code&gt;"Buzz"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;dup&lt;/code&gt; to duplicate the value on top of the stack, then calls
&lt;code&gt;fizz?&lt;/code&gt;, converting the top copy into a boolean. After this, the top of the
stack consists of the original value, and the boolean returned by &lt;code&gt;fizz?&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; swaps these, so the original top-of-stack value is back on top, and the
boolean is underneath. Next we call &lt;code&gt;buzz?&lt;/code&gt;, which replaces the top-of-stack
value with a boolean flag. Now the top two values on the stack are booleans
representing whether the number was divisible by 3 or 5.  After this, we call
&lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; to see if either of these is true, and &lt;code&gt;invert&lt;/code&gt; to negate this value.
Logically, the body of &lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;!(x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt; returns a boolean indicating if the argument is not
divisible by 3 or 5, and thus should be printed.  Finally, &lt;code&gt;do-fizz-buzz&lt;/code&gt; loops
from 1 to 25, calling &lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, and outputting &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt;
returns true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re having trouble figuring out what’s going on inside &lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt;, the
example below might help you to understand how it works. All we’re doing here
is executing each word of the definition of &lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt; on a separate line. As
you execute each line, watch the stack to see how it changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: fizz?  3 mod 0 = dup if ." Fizz" then ;
: buzz?  5 mod 0 = dup if ." Buzz" then ;
4
dup
fizz?
swap
buzz?
or
invert
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how each line affects the stack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4         4 &amp;lt;- Top
dup       4 4 &amp;lt;- Top
fizz?     4 0 &amp;lt;- Top
swap      0 4 &amp;lt;- Top
buzz?     0 0 &amp;lt;- Top
or        0 &amp;lt;- Top
invert    -1 &amp;lt;- Top
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, the final value on the stack is the return value of the &lt;code&gt;fizz-buzz?&lt;/code&gt;
word. In this case, it’s true, because the number was not divisible by 3 or 5,
and so should be printed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the same thing but starting with 5:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;5         5 &amp;lt;- Top
dup       5 5 &amp;lt;- Top
fizz?     5 0 &amp;lt;- Top
swap      0 5 &amp;lt;- Top
buzz?     0 -1 &amp;lt;- Top
or        -1 &amp;lt;- Top
invert    0 &amp;lt;- Top
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case the original top-of-stack value was divisible by 5, so nothing should be printed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forth also allows you to save values in variables and constants. Variables allow you to keep track of changing values without having to store them on the stack. Constants give you a simple way to refer to a value that won’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the role of local variables is generally played by the stack, variables in Forth are used more to store state that may be needed across multiple words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining variables is simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable balance
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This basically associates a particular memory location with the name &lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt; is now a word, and all it does is to push its memory location onto the
stack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable balance
balance
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see the value &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt; on the stack. This Forth implementation arbitrarily
starts storing variables at the memory location &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; stores a value at the memory location referenced by a variable, and the
word &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; fetches the value from a memory location:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable balance
123 balance !
balance @
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time you should see the value &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; on the stack. &lt;code&gt;123 balance&lt;/code&gt; pushes the
value and the memory location onto the stack, and &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; stores that value at that
memory location. Likewise, &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; retrieves the value based on the memory location,
and pushes that value onto the stack. If you’ve used C or C++, you can think of
&lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt; as a pointer that is dereferenced by &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; is defined as &lt;code&gt;@ .&lt;/code&gt; and it prints the current value of a variable.
The word &lt;code&gt;+!&lt;/code&gt; is used to increase the value of a variable by a certain amount
(like &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; in C-based languages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable balance
123 balance !
balance ?
50 balance +!
balance ?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run this code and you should see:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a value that doesn’t change, you can store it as a constant. Constants are defined in one line, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;42 constant answer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a new constant called &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; with the value &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike variables,
constants just represent values, rather than memory locations, so there’s no need
to use &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;42 constant answer
2 answer *
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running this will push the value &lt;code&gt;84&lt;/code&gt; on the stack. &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; is treated as if it
was the number it represents (just like constants and variables in other languages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forth doesn’t exactly support arrays, but it does allow you to allocate a zone of contiguous memory, a lot like arrays in C. To allocate this memory, use the &lt;code&gt;allot&lt;/code&gt;
word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable numbers
3 cells allot
10 numbers 0 cells + !
20 numbers 1 cells + !
30 numbers 2 cells + !
40 numbers 3 cells + !
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example creates a memory location called &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt;, and reserves three extra
memory cells after this location, giving a total of four memory cells. (&lt;code&gt;cells&lt;/code&gt;
just multiplies by the cell-width, which is 1 in this implementation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;numbers 0 +&lt;/code&gt; gives the address of the first cell in the array. &lt;code&gt;10 numbers 0 + !&lt;/code&gt;
stores the value &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; in the first cell of the array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can easily write words to simplify array access:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable numbers
3 cells allot
: number  ( offset -- addr )  cells numbers + ;

10 0 number !
20 1 number !
30 2 number !
40 3 number !

2 number ?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; takes an offset into &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; and returns the memory address at that
offset. &lt;code&gt;30 2 number !&lt;/code&gt; stores &lt;code&gt;30&lt;/code&gt; at offset &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;2 number ?&lt;/code&gt;
prints the value at offset &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forth has a special word called &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;, which is used for accepting keyboard input.
When the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; word is executed, execution is paused until a key is pressed. Once
a key is pressed, the key code of that key is pushed onto the stack. Try out the
following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;key . key . key .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you run this line, you’ll notice that at first nothing happens. This is because the interpreter is waiting for your keyboard input. Try hitting the &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; key, and
you should see the keycode for that key, &lt;code&gt;65&lt;/code&gt;, appear as output on the current line.
Now hit &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, and you should see the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;begin until&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forth has another kind of loop called &lt;code&gt;begin until&lt;/code&gt;. This works like a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;
loop in C-based languages. Every time the word &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt; is hit, the interpreter
checks to see if the top of the stack is non-zero (true). If it is, it jumps
back to the matching &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt;. If not, execution continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of using &lt;code&gt;begin until&lt;/code&gt; to print key codes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: print-keycode  begin key dup . 32 = until ;
print-keycode
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will keep printing key codes until you press space. You should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; waits for key input, then &lt;code&gt;dup&lt;/code&gt; duplicates the keycode from &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;. We
then use &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; to output the top copy of the keycode, and &lt;code&gt;32 =&lt;/code&gt; to check to see
if the keycode is equal to 32. If it is, we break out of the loop, otherwise we
loop back to &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to put it all together and make a game! Rather than having you type all the code, I’ve pre-loaded it into the editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we look at the code, try playing the game. To start the game, execute the word &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;. Then use the arrow keys to move the snake. If you lose, you can run
&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve too deeply into this code, two disclaimers. First, this is terrible Forth code. I’m by no means a Forth expert, so there’s probably all kinds of things I’m doing in completely the wrong way. Second, this game uses a few non-standard techniques in order to interface with JavaScript. I’ll go through these now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that this editor is different from the others: it has an HTML5 Canvas element built in. I’ve created a very simple memory-mapped interface for drawing onto this canvas. The canvas is split up into 24 x 24 “pixels” which can be black or white. The first pixel is found at the memory address given by the variable &lt;code&gt;graphics&lt;/code&gt;, and the rest of the pixels are offsets from the variable. So,
for example, to draw a white pixel in the top-left corner you could run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 graphics !
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game uses the following words to draw to the canvas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: convert-x-y ( x y -- offset )  24 cells * + ;
: draw ( color x y -- )  convert-x-y graphics + ! ;
: draw-white ( x y -- )  1 rot rot draw ;
: draw-black ( x y -- )  0 rot rot draw ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;3 4 draw-white&lt;/code&gt; draws a white pixel at the coordinates (3, 4). The
y coordinate is multiplied by 24 to get the row, then the x coordinated is added
to get the column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forth word &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; blocks, so is unsuitable for a game like this. I’ve added
a variable called &lt;code&gt;last-key&lt;/code&gt; which always holds the value of the last key to be
pressed. &lt;code&gt;last-key&lt;/code&gt; is only updated while the interpreter is running Forth code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forth standard doesn’t define a way of generating random numbers, so I’ve added a word called &lt;code&gt;random ( range -- n )&lt;/code&gt; that takes a range and returns a
random number from 0 to range - 1. For example, &lt;code&gt;3 random&lt;/code&gt; could
return &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sleep ( ms -- )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’ve added a blocking &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; word that pauses execution for the
number of milliseconds given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can work through the code from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start of the code just sets up some variables and constants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable snake-x-head
500 cells allot

variable snake-y-head
500 cells allot

variable apple-x
variable apple-y

0 constant left
1 constant up
2 constant right
3 constant down

24 constant width
24 constant height

variable direction
variable length
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;snake-x-head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;snake-y-head&lt;/code&gt; are memory locations used to store the x and
y coordinates of the head of the snake. 500 cells of memory are alloted after
these two locations to store the coordinates of the tail of the snake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next we define two words for accessing memory locations representing the body of the snake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: snake-x ( offset -- address )
  cells snake-x-head + ;

: snake-y ( offset -- address )
  cells snake-y-head + ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; word earlier, these two words are used to access
elements in the arrays of snake segments. After this come some words for
drawing to the canvas, described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use constants to refer to the four directions (&lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;up&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, and
&lt;code&gt;down&lt;/code&gt;), and a variable &lt;code&gt;direction&lt;/code&gt; to store the current direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this we initialize everything:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: draw-walls
  width 0 do
    i 0 draw-black
    i height 1 - draw-black
  loop
  height 0 do
    0 i draw-black
    width 1 - i draw-black
  loop ;

: initialize-snake
  4 length !
  length @ 1 + 0 do
    12 i - i snake-x !
    12 i snake-y !
  loop
  right direction ! ;

: set-apple-position apple-x ! apple-y ! ;

: initialize-apple  4 4 set-apple-position ;

: initialize
  width 0 do
    height 0 do
      j i draw-white
    loop
  loop
  draw-walls
  initialize-snake
  initialize-apple ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;draw-walls&lt;/code&gt; uses two &lt;code&gt;do/loop&lt;/code&gt;s to draw the horizontal and vertical walls,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;initialize-snake&lt;/code&gt; sets the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; variable to &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, then loops from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;length + 1&lt;/code&gt; filling in the starting snake positions. The snake positions are
always kept one longer than the length so we can grow the snake easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;set-apple-position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;initialize-apple&lt;/code&gt; set the initial position of the
apple to (4,4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; fills everything in white and calls the three
initialization words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the code for moving the snake based on the current value of &lt;code&gt;direction&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: move-up  -1 snake-y-head +! ;
: move-left  -1 snake-x-head +! ;
: move-down  1 snake-y-head +! ;
: move-right  1 snake-x-head +! ;

: move-snake-head  direction @
  left over  = if move-left else
  up over    = if move-up else
  right over = if move-right else
  down over  = if move-down
  then then then then drop ;

\ Move each segment of the snake forward by one
: move-snake-tail  0 length @ do
    i snake-x @ i 1 + snake-x !
    i snake-y @ i 1 + snake-y !
  -1 +loop ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;move-up&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;move-left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;move-down&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;move-right&lt;/code&gt; just add or subtract one
from the x or y coordinate of the snake head. &lt;code&gt;move-snake-head&lt;/code&gt; inspects the
value of &lt;code&gt;direction&lt;/code&gt; and calls the appropriate &lt;code&gt;move-*&lt;/code&gt; word. This &lt;code&gt;over = if&lt;/code&gt;
pattern is an idiomatic way of doing case statements in Forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;move-snake-tail&lt;/code&gt; goes through the array of snake positions backwards, copying
each value forward by 1 cell. This is called before we move the snake head, to
move each segment of the snake forward one space. It uses a &lt;code&gt;do/+loop&lt;/code&gt;, a
variation of a &lt;code&gt;do/loop&lt;/code&gt; that pops the stack on every iteration and adds that
value to the next index, instead of incrementing by 1 each time. So &lt;code&gt;0 length @
do -1 +loop&lt;/code&gt; loops from &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; in increments of &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next section of code takes the keyboard input and changes the snake direction if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: is-horizontal  direction @ dup
  left = swap
  right = or ;

: is-vertical  direction @ dup
  up = swap
  down = or ;

: turn-up     is-horizontal if up direction ! then ;
: turn-left   is-vertical if left direction ! then ;
: turn-down   is-horizontal if down direction ! then ;
: turn-right  is-vertical if right direction ! then ;

: change-direction ( key -- )
  37 over = if turn-left else
  38 over = if turn-up else
  39 over = if turn-right else
  40 over = if turn-down
  then then then then drop ;

: check-input
  last-key @ change-direction
  0 last-key ! ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;is-horizontal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;is-vertical&lt;/code&gt; check the current status of the &lt;code&gt;direction&lt;/code&gt;
variable to see if it’s a horizontal or vertical direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;turn-*&lt;/code&gt; words are used to set a new direction, but use &lt;code&gt;is-horizontal&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;is-vertical&lt;/code&gt; to check the current direction first to see if the new direction
is valid. For example, if the snake is moving horizontally, setting a new
direction of &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;change-direction&lt;/code&gt; takes a key and calls the appropriate &lt;code&gt;turn-*&lt;/code&gt; word if the
key was one of the arrow keys. &lt;code&gt;check-input&lt;/code&gt; does the work of getting the last
key from the &lt;code&gt;last-key&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-variable, calling &lt;code&gt;change-direction&lt;/code&gt;, then setting
&lt;code&gt;last-key&lt;/code&gt; to 0 to indicate that the most recent keypress has been dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next code is used for checking to see if the apple has been eaten, and if so, moving it to a new (random) location. Also, if the apple has been eaten we grow the snake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\ get random x or y position within playable area
: random-position ( -- pos )
  width 4 - random 2 + ;

: move-apple
  apple-x @ apple-y @ draw-white
  random-position random-position
  set-apple-position ;

: grow-snake  1 length +! ;

: check-apple ( -- flag )
  snake-x-head @ apple-x @ =
  snake-y-head @ apple-y @ =
  and if
    move-apple
    grow-snake
  then ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;random-position&lt;/code&gt; generates a random x or y coordinate in the range of &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;width - 2&lt;/code&gt;. This prevents the apple from ever appearing right next to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;move-apple&lt;/code&gt; erases the current apple (using &lt;code&gt;draw-white&lt;/code&gt;) then creates a new
pair of x/y coordinates for the apple using &lt;code&gt;random-position&lt;/code&gt; twice. Finally,
it calls &lt;code&gt;set-apple-position&lt;/code&gt; to move the apple to the new coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grow-snake&lt;/code&gt; simply adds one to the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;check-apple&lt;/code&gt; compares the x/y coordinates of the apple and the snake head to
see if they’re the same (using &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; twice and &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; to combine the two
booleans). If the coordinates are the same, we call &lt;code&gt;move-apple&lt;/code&gt; to move the
apple to a new position and &lt;code&gt;grow-snake&lt;/code&gt; to make the snake 1 segment longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next we see if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: check-collision ( -- flag )
  \ get current x/y position
  snake-x-head @ snake-y-head @

  \ get color at current position
  convert-x-y graphics + @

  \ leave boolean flag on stack
  0 = ;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;check-collision&lt;/code&gt; checks to see if the new snake head position is already black
(this word is called after updating the snake’s position but before drawing
it at the new position). We leave a boolean on the stack to say whether a
collision has occured or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next two words are responsible for drawing the snake and apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: draw-snake

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;draw-snake&lt;/code&gt; loops through each cell in the snake arrays, drawing a black pixel
for each one. After that it draws a white pixel at an offset of &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;. The
last part of the tail is at &lt;code&gt;length - 1&lt;/code&gt; into the array so &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; holds the
previous last tail segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;draw-apple&lt;/code&gt; simply draws a black pixel at the apple’s current location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game loop constantly loops until a collision occurs, calling each of the words defined above in turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;: game-loop ( -- )

whether to continue looping or to exit the loop. When the loop is exited the
string &lt;code&gt;"Game Over"&lt;/code&gt; is printed. We use &lt;code&gt;100 sleep&lt;/code&gt; to pause for 100 ms every
iteration, making the game run at rougly 10 fps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; just calls &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; to reset everything, then kicks off &lt;code&gt;game-loop&lt;/code&gt;.
Because all the initialization happens in the &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; word, you can call
&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; again after game over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s it! Hopefully all the code in the game made sense. If not, you can try running individual words to see their effect on the stack and/or on the variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forth is actually much more powerful than what I’ve taught here (and what I implemented in my interpreter). A true Forth system allows you to modify how the compiler works and create new defining words, allowing you to completely customize your environment and create your own languages within Forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great resource for learning the full power of Forth is the short book “Starting Forth” by Leo Brodie. It’s available for free online and teaches you all the fun stuff I left out. It also has a good set of exercises for you to test out your knowledge. You’ll need to download a copy of SwiftForth to run the code though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A while back I attended a Cloudflare board meeting and carried my laptop in a brown paper bag from a grocery store. This elicited a few comments about needing a real bag. But I've often carried my laptop in inconspicuous bags. For me, the ultimate laptop bag is one that looks nothing like a laptop bag; it should look like nothing special at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unhappily, grocery bags are not very strong. But there is a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Movie prop grocery bags like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like a classic brown paper grocery bag, but it isn't. It's actually a silent prop made for a film set where the noise from a crinkling paper bag would overwhelm the dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of being made from paper, it's made from fabric and is more robust then an actual paper bag. It's also nearly silent (well, much, much quieter than the real thing).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also the ideal size for my trusty and vintage MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
