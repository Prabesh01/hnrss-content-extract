Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Judy Hanwen Shen [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:40:43 UTC (2,680 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.CY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is planning a Linux-native GOG Galaxy, calling Linux the 'next major frontier.'&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is hiring a senior engineer to shape Galaxy's architecture for Linux from day one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Galaxy will let Linux users relive classics without the usual headaches.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming on Linux used to be in a nasty catch-22. People wouldn't develop games for Linux because gamers didn't use it, and gamers didn't use Linux because people wouldn't develop games for it. However, with the advancement of tech like Proton, we're beginning to see people take Linux seriously as a gaming powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn't mean that the Linux community won't welcome developers who create Linux-native versions of their games and related apps. So, when the news broke that GOG was hiring a developer to help get its library app over into the world of FOSS, it was good news for everyone who wants to bring the classics over to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;GOG's new owner details how he plans to take on Steam: publish less chaff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world of monopolies, GOG wants a niche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GOG calls Linux "a major frontier" as it aims to make Galaxy Linux-native&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It's the next step in GOG's plans to appeal to Linux users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by VideoCardz, a recent job advertisement on the GOG website revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code is cheap. Show me the talk.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TLDR; Software development, as it has been done for decades, is over. LLM coding tools have changed it fundamentally for the better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” — Linus Torvalds, August 2000&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, made this quip in response to a claim about a complex piece of programming in the Linux kernel, [1] I was an oblivious, gangly, fledgling teenage n00b coder learning by copy-pasting open source Perl and VB snippets over dialup internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quip has since become an adage in the software world. The gist of it back then was that, it was easy to talk about all the software stuff one would like to do, or could be hypothetically done, but unless one actually put in the effort and proved it, talk wasn’t of much value. Writing and proving good software was a high-effort, high-cost, high-skill endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even when armed with a crystal clear software development plan and the exact know-how to implement it, any sufficiently complex piece of programming is high-effort, tedious, and time consuming to actually write and get to a form where it is functional, reliable, and at least reasonably future-ready. In the process of developing software, any number of unforeseen complexities and gotchas can arise with many unresolvable trade-offs,[2] both technical and external. It is not uncommon for software architectures to change mid-way multiple times. The cost of just trying things out is so exponentially high that the significant majority of ideas are simply never tried out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, the real bottleneck is good old physical and biological human constraints—cognitive bandwidth, personal time and resources, and most importantly, the biological cost and constraints of having to sit for indefinite periods, writing code with one’s own hands line by line even if it is all in one’s head, while juggling and context-switching through the mental map of large systems. And if it is more than one individual, a whole host of interpersonal coordination and communication dynamics come into play. It is thus very difficult to prototype and try out not just grand ideas, but even reasonably simple ones. As many of us have done, most ideas are generally appended to a bottomless wishlist where they very likely stay forever. That’s how I have programmed and written software on a regular basis and enjoyed it—from hobby stuff to critical systems that millions of people depend on—for about 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that has now been thrown out of the window, of course, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming back to Linus, fast-forward 25 years, when he merges a chunk of AI-generated code into his toy project and comments “Is this much better than I could do by hand? Sure is.”, [3] I, no longer the fledgling n00b, but someone with decades of software development scars and calluses (both physical and metaphorical), am able to grasp its implications. Not only that, now with a sizeable amount of first-hand experience with LLM-assisted coding, I am compelled to say, software development, as it has been done for decades, is over. Along with that, many other things are too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say that with the full awareness that it smacks of Fukuyama’s The End of History, [4] but I will reiterate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Software development, as it has been done for decades, is over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was lucky to be in the transitionary Goldilocks era to witness and to partake in the breakneck evolution of the internet and software landscape—dialup to DSL to gigabit; Basic, Visual Basic 4/5/6 and Delphi; rise and fall of cgi-bin; Altavista to Google; XMLHttpRequest kicking off Web 2.0; rise and fall of Flash; death of IE and the rise of Chrome; WAP to Symbian to Android and smartphone apps; the demise of SourceForge and the massive proliferation and success of FOSS (Free and Open-source Software); git and GitHub; rise of SaaS; ExpertsExchange to StackOverflow; the growth of the Linux world; sysadmin to devops to whateverOps; the ominous birthing of Node.js and MongoDB in the same year; microservices; the explosion of VC-funded software “unicorns”; crypto and web3 shams; the rapid darkening of patterns; widespread enshittification and monetisation of privacy, attention, and dignity; and the monumental bloating of software that has since become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All throughout this, I have been writing, maintaining, and deploying software both as a professional developer and as a FOSS hobbyist dabbling in a gazillion languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies. From thinking that “indenting code is lame” (cringe) as a teen, from copy-pasting to CVS to svn to git, fighting space vs. tab battles, to maturing to “whatever floats your boat” and still regularly compressing PNGs to shave off a few KBs, I have been a dabbler, dilettante, and an addict, someone who has unconditionally enjoyed writing code and developing software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now? How I develop software now is not how I have done it all these years, all the right, wrong, good, bad, easy and hard bits combined. With the advent of code-assisting LLMs, it has been completely flipped on its head, and I don’t think there is any going back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that is some “Tears in rain”-esque [5] monologue right there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barring a bunch of obvious objective 101s, there is no universal measure of what makes a codebase good or great. Styles, idioms, patterns, architectures all vary greatly. Even objectively provable technical choices are subject to trade-offs that defy consensus. For a software developer like me, historically, there have been a few rule-of-thumb indicators for quick evaluation of software. When I evaluate a FOSS project, I look at a bunch of factors, all a mix of objective and subjective, weighted differently under different contexts—the project’s age; is the commit activity overly sparse or frantic; frameworks and dependencies; is code consistently organised and commented without being over-abstracted; is there a community around it; are maintainers responsive; can I actually get it up and running quickly from a clear README; the quality and depth of its documentation …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these rule-of-thumb signals give a reasonable glimpse of the mental model and the style of working of the maintainers and the likely future trajectory of the project. For example, concise comments, README, and documentation indicate thoughtfulness, extra effort, and empathy for other developers (and self). Mainly because, for mortal developers like me, documentation and tests are a necessity, but unpleasant, boring, and tedious things to write and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, those notions have now been abruptly and violently defenestrated by LLMs. They can now one-shot generate stunning looking documentation pages, dense (ironically, pedantically detailed) READMEs, build great looking user interfaces, neatly organise code with proper idioms, patterns, and comments. One can no longer know whether such a repository was “vibe” coded by a non-technical person who has never written a single line of code, or an experienced developer, who may or may not have used LLM assistance. These no longer indicate the quality of a codebase. On the contrary, the more stunning or perfect looking something is, the more suspicious it is now—was it low-effort, one-shot vibe coded?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the tell-tale, rule-of-thumb measures of code and software quality being outright dead, without a much closer inspection and a bit of expert forensic analysis, it is now difficult to tell the wheat from the “slop”. One is now slowly being compelled to also look much more closely at the provenance of software—the who, why, their track record, and plans of governance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Effort&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, it would take a reasonably long period of consistent effort and many iterations of refinement for a good developer to produce 10,000 lines of quality code that not only delivered meaningful results, but was easily readable and maintainable. While the number of lines of code is not a measure of code quality—it is often the inverse—a codebase with good quality 10,000 lines of code indicated significant time, effort, focus, patience, expertise, and often, skills like project management that went into it. Human traits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, LLMs can not only one-shot generate that in seconds, they can handle many technical aspects of the software development workflow, from testing to sysadmin to publishing. Unlike the unpredictable outcomes of frenzied vibe coding, when steered with human expertise, the output can be high quality and highly effective.[6] This has been my personal experience as well. On a regular basis, I have been compressing work that would have taken me weeks and months to mere days and even hours. That too, without vibe coding, an AGENT.md file, or any fancy multi-agent workflows or orchestration. Just an LLM agent CLI at arm’s length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a developer with a bottomless wishlist of things I wish I could have done or tried out, I have been able to use LLM tools to not just rapidly prototype and validate complex ideas, but actually write good quality production-grade software (my own subjective metric, of course) with better code than I could have written manually—things where I knew exactly what I had to do, but was constrained by physical limits, and also things that were unclear to me and needed novel ideas, approaches, and leaps. All the while, learning and bettering my own understanding of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The physiological, cognitive, and emotional cost I generally incur to achieve the software outcomes I want or am capable of engineering, has undoubtedly reduced by several orders of magnitude. The time and bandwidth this has freed up, I now spend on engineering, architecting, debating, tinkering, trying to expand my imagination, and writing much more concise and meaningful code that I actually want to write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember the old adage, “programming is 90% thinking and 10% typing”? It is now, for real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Slop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given all that, what is the value of code as an artefact, when it can be generated at an industrial scale within seconds by someone who has never written any code? Barring obviously bad LLM-generated code, when code is neatly structured and functional (yes, LLMs can write good code when steered competently), what makes it valuable or not? We wouldn’t want LLM-generated code in systems out there in the real world, but would instead prefer pure unadulterated human code, yes? Well, that would be a wonderful joke.[7] [8] [9] [10] [11]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality is that the significant majority of the code written by humans globally on a daily basis, is likely borderline junk.[12] Software development is not even a discipline that has reached any objective level of maturity. Medical doctors and civil engineers go through rigorous training to be issued licenses that are contingent on real world ramifications of their work. How about software developers and engineers? The world runs on shoddily engineered, poorly cobbled together, bloated systems with garbage code that humans have written, mostly directed by people in positions of power with perverse incentives who have absolutely no technical know-how or have any grounding in the humanities—the tyranny of non-tech “tech leaders”.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could, to trigger emotions, argue that AI slop is at least neatly formatted, well documented, and more syntactically consistent than the vast majority of human-written code. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kidding aside, I am no fan of AI slop. Reading those obvious soulless LLM-generated messages and articles on the (dead) internet[14] is a waste of neuronal activation in the amygdala, if there is any activation at all. That so many people across the world LLM-speak and emote in the exact same manner on the internet, is creepy self-Pluribus-ification.[15] Without human creation, perfection and flaws, language, literature, art, music etc. are unenjoyable (to most). Infinite, instantly-generatable stuff without human constraints and limits, is actually very difficult to value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is code, then? Well, code is a bit different from art, literature, or any form of direct communication and evocation. Code was always a means to an end. Unlike poetry or prose, end users don’t read or care about code. They don’t care what language or framework or the architecture the hundred systems running behind a portal are made of. Code is hidden. They interact with the effect and outcomes of code through various forms of UX. I say that, slightly begrudgingly, as someone who enjoys writing, organising, and even nurturing code. For those who are immersed in it, there is an element of creativity and art in it, and many like me, are borderline curmudgeons on all things software.[16]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ignoring outright bad code, in a world where functional code is so abundant that “good” and “bad” are indistinguishable, ultimately, what makes functional AI code slop or non-slop? I am strongly inclined to think that it is the framework of accountability, and ironically, the element of humanness. That is, all things (code) being equal, the ability to hold someone accountable at least emotionally and morally (and sometimes legally), for an artefact, instills value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When one gets that big pull request (PR) on an open source repository, irrespective of its quality, if it is handwritten by a human, there is an intrinsic value and empathy for the human time and effort that is likely ascribed to it. It is known that there is a physical and cognitive cost that has been paid writing a lot of code before raising a PR. That is what makes that code “expensive” and not cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a PR is obviously LLM-generated, irrespective of how good it is, the first reaction is likely to be “slop!”, because it is no longer possible to instantly ascertain the human effort behind it. On the other hand, the effort required to read and validate it is disproportionately and exponentially high—setting aside people who have also offloaded reading of code to LLMs. It may very well be the best possible functional code, but it is one out of an infinite possible variation that could have been generated with no human cost or effort. Emotionally, it feels wrong and unfair to be burdened by such code dumps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, at that point, our reality has become a version of Borges’ Library of Babel.[17]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FOSS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of libraries, FOSS is perhaps the greatest public commons that humanity has created. The genesis of FOSS and its predecessors, various schemes for sharing code, can be traced to the fundamental premise that software was prohibitively expensive and required immense specialist skills to create. Only a tiny handful of people in the world had the ability to do that, and everyone else was naturally forced to use the creations of the few (proprietary or not). While the global developer ecosystem has exploded since then, the ratio of makers to users has largely remained the same. Largescale FOSS collaboration and community dynamics all stem from that—codebases as valuable shared artefacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens in a world where code is cheap and small to medium-sized software libraries and modules can be quickly created by an expert, perfectly customised and attuned to their needs, no matter how niche? Forget expertise, a world where anyone reasonably savvy can vibe code the small things they need for their private use, however they please. I see this happening everywhere. What is happening to StackOverflow[18] is also happening to software, although not as dramatically. This seems to strike at the very heart of the human dynamics, societal conditions, and incentives that drive FOSS collaboration and sharing. Add to that, if one considers the impending Cambrian explosion of FOSS projects manufactured at an unprecedented scale, the high-quality FOSS projects that remain and thrive, expert governance, curation, and trust are likely to become more valuable than the code itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Missing the forest for the trees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans have produced amazing software when there was no syntax highlighting, IDEs, or any kind of tooling. And humans also produce trash despite all the tooling and resources in the world. A good competent developer with good articulation skills and care for quality will use LLMs, or any other tools, in their own ways to produce quality outcomes. An incompetent developer with poor articulation skills or one with a lack of care for quality, will produce bad stuff, LLMs or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the extreme proponents of manic “agentic” vibe coding,[19] and the outright denouncers of LLMs, are both missing the forest for the trees. That there is a pragmatic middle path, where people who have the experience, expertise, competence, and the ability to articulate can use these tools to get the outcomes they desire with the right sets of trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibe coding has its place, especially for non-technical people, who, for the first time, can tinker, explore, have fun, and empower themselves with software. I see this happening all around me. However, the fanatical acolytes of vibe coding are missing a very important thing that makes humans take artefacts seriously—finitude. They’re generating a vast Borgesian library where they themselves are likely to be lost in an ocean of slop generated by sycophantic agents. Slop, not because the code is of poor quality, but because anything that can be generated infinitely without effort and has no meaningful provenance, is very hard to value or take seriously. Humans fundamentally do not deal well with an infinite supply of anything, especially choices. Completely unsurprising because we are heavily constrained biological beings that have evolved on a finite planet with finite resources to live out finite lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, the denouncers, they can’t seem to get past the argument from incredulity.[20] They denounce LLMs because they don’t personally like them for whatever reason, or have been unable to get desirable outcomes, or had the wrong expectations about them, or have simply gotten sick of them. But that is immaterial because there is a sizeable population who are using the exact same tools fruitfully and have the opposite experience. I am one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that said, the widespread braindead and outright stupid and harmful implementations of these technologies fuelled by hype, frenzy, and greed are an unfortunate reality and a massive cause of concern. The AI-business bubble is perhaps one of the biggest in history. The rise of FOSS AI technologies makes one hopeful. However, to incorrectly conflate bad actors, bad actions, bean-counting, and nonsensical implementations with fundamental, physical capabilities of these technologies—not theoretical, but the regular, proven, and practical—is irrational. It is missing the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The human cost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this has been from the perspective of an experienced developer and engineer. For someone who has been weathered and bruised enough, these AI technologies provide extremely effective and powerful assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about the young folks who are just starting out? If one does not have their fundamentals in place, if one has not developed an innate and nuanced understanding of systems and the process of software development, then these technologies are unreliable, dangerous genies. One asks for code, it gives code. One asks for changes, it gives changes. Soon, one is stuck with a codebase whose workings one doesn’t understand, and one is forced to go back to the genie and depend on it helplessly. And because one is hooked on and dependent on the genie, the natural circumstances that otherwise would allow for foundational and fundamental skills and understanding to develop, never arise, to the point of cognitive decline.[21] What then happens to an entire generation of juniors, who never get an opportunity to become seniors meaningfully?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t care about the extreme vibe coders or denouncers or even slop. We are all going to drown in a deluge of slop, from which, many islands of sanity, recovery, and a new order of software will emerge. The real concern is for generations of learners who are being robbed of the opportunity to acquire the expertise to objectively discern what is slop and what is not. Even worse, the possibility that experienced folks who use these tools effectively, will feel disincentivised from mentoring and training junior folks in foundational ways, something that was a natural part of societal evolution. And not just with software development, but the wholesale offloading of agency and decision-making to black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Talk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, for a hands-on developer, reading and critically evaluating code have become more important than learning syntax and typing it out line by line. Of course, that is still an important skill, because the ability to read code effectively comes from that in the first place. But, the daily software development workflows have flipped over completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An experienced developer who can talk well, that is, imagine, articulate, define problem statements, architect and engineer, has a massive advantage over someone who cannot, more disproportionately than ever. Knowledge of specific language, syntax, and frameworks—code—is no longer a bottleneck. The physiological constraints of yore are no longer impediments. The machinery for instantly creating code at scale is now a commodity and available to everyone, just a &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt; equivalent away. It requires no special training, no new language or framework to learn, and has practically no entry barriers—just good old critical thinking and foundational human skills, and competence to run the machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conventional software development methodologies and roles—Waterfall[22] to Agile,[23] developer to tester, senior to junior—have fundamentally changed with traditional boundaries consolidating into unimaginably fast, compressed, blurry, iterative “agentic” loops. The dynamics of people, organisations, and public communities in software development, the very human incentives for sharing and collaboration,[24] [25] [26] are all changing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, good talk is exponentially more valuable than good code. The ramifications of this are significant and disruptive. This time, it is different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This story was produced and originally published by Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. It was made possible by donors like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did a $1 billion, 520-acre data center proposed by one of the world’s richest companies go unnoticed in tiny Beaver Dam, Wisconsin?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key reason: In a city that lists “communication matters” atop its core values, officials took steps to keep the project hidden for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;News with a little more humanity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” newsletter keeps you connected to the state you love without feeling overwhelmed. No paywall. No agenda. No corporate filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Meta, the trillion-dollar company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is building a complex as big as 12 football fields in a city with a population of 16,000, enough to fill only a fifth of Lambeau Field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s one of seven major data center projects pending in Wisconsin that combined are worth more than $57 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In four of them, including Beaver Dam, local government officials kept the massive projects under wraps through confidential nondisclosure agreements, a Wisconsin Watch investigation has found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secrecy also occurred in the three communities without NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one, the Madison suburb of DeForest, officials worked behind the scenes for months before publicly announcing a proposed $12 billion data center, which residents are fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of public disclosure, while relatively common for typical development proposals in the planning stages, raises questions about how much time the public should have to digest projects that dramatically affect the economy, land use, energy, taxes, the environment and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As soon as community leadership is contemplating, even entertaining it, I think they need to make the public aware,” said retired tech executive Prescott Balch, who is advising residents around Wisconsin where data centers are proposed. “Even if it makes it harder, that’s the right way to do it. And nobody is doing it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blowback from residents who have been kept in the dark has spurred a new legislative proposal that would ban data center NDAs statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Beaver Dam did it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has some 40 data centers, stretching from Kenosha to Eau Claire. But most are tiny compared with the big seven: three under construction in Beaver Dam, Mount Pleasant and Port Washington; and four proposed in DeForest, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides storing and processing data, data centers are vital to advancing the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A case study in how projects each worth $1 billion or more are kept quiet is Beaver Dam, the Dodge County burg an hour northeast of Madison, where Meta’s data center is expected to open in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beaver Dam Area Development Corp., a quasi-government nonprofit that functions as the city’s economic development arm, signed an NDA on Dec. 1, 2023, not with Meta, but with a shell company no one had ever heard of, Balloonist LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agreement referred only to a “project,” making no mention of a data center or Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA was signed “very early, almost in the introductory period of that project,” the development corporation’s leader, Trent Campbell, told Wisconsin Watch. All major development projects have “different levels of confidentiality for different purposes. And this entity believed it to be necessary at the onset of the conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA meant that the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. could not reveal its discussions with Balloonist, or even disclose “the existence of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA also put the wheels in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a year, the city quietly took official actions to make the data center a reality, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2024: The city council voted 12-0 to approve a predevelopment agreement with another shell company, Degas LLC, that only later was identified with the data center. The agenda and the minutes of the meeting don’t mention a data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 2024: The city council created a tax incremental finance, or TIF, district for the data center to help fund development. The agenda and the minutes for that meeting do not mention a data center, though the agreement itself does.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not until February 2025 — 14 months after the NDA was signed — did the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. announce that it and the city were working with a company — then still unidentified — on a “potential data center project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Campbell noted to Wisconsin Watch that Gov. Tony Evers and other officials had identified the site for a major development as far back as 2019. For months after the NDA was signed, it wasn’t known whether the data center would come to fruition, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know the opponents currently disagree, but I think the city acted in as transparent a way as they could,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, a news report in April 2025 identified Meta, which declined comment for this story, as the company likely behind the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta confirmed its involvement eight months later, saying on Facebook: “We’re proud to call Beaver Dam home. We are honored to have joined such an incredible community in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first reply to that post was from a Beaver Dam resident, who wrote: “We would have been honored to have the opportunity to decline this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secrecy without an NDA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs also helped keep the public in the dark about data centers under consideration in the three other cities that used them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Menomonie signed its NDA with Balloonist LLC in February 2024 — more than a year before the city in northwest Wisconsin announced a $1.6 billion data center proposal in July 2025. Two months after the NDA, the city council unanimously helped pave the way for a data center by changing a land use ordinance. The change gave, for the first time, a definition of the ordinance’s reference to “warehousing,” saying warehousing includes data centers. The city’s mayor put the proposed data center on hold in September 2025. In January 2026, the city council adopted a zoning ordinance for data centers that reversed the warehousing definition. “Based upon feedback from the community and elected officials, it is clear that additional discussion should occur regarding the appropriate level of regulation of data centers,” the city’s public works director told the council and the mayor.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kenosha signed its NDA, with Microsoft, in May 2024, six months before news reports surfaced saying the NDA kept the proposed data center operator’s name confidential. It was later announced that Microsoft had purchased 240 acres in the neighboring town of Paris, which the city annexed in December 2024. No dollar amount for the proposal has been announced.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Janesville announced in July 2025 it was approached by developers about a data center and put out a request for proposal. The city signed its NDA two months later and is now in negotiations with Viridian Acquisitions, a Colorado developer, for an $8 billion data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Port Washington in Ozaukee County and Mount Pleasant in Racine County responded to records requests from Wisconsin Watch saying they had not signed NDAs for their data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Port Washington, where three people were arrested during a city council meeting on the data center in December, residents are trying to recall Mayor Ted Neitzke, saying he has been secretive about the $15 billion data center from OpenAI, Oracle and Vantage Data Centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft this month announced plans to add 15 data centers, worth $13 billion, to the $7 billion complex under construction there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs are described by economic development officials as necessary and criticized by data center opponents as against the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs and other steps to protect confidentiality are crucial at the early stages of a development proposal, said Tricia Braun, executive director of the Wisconsin Data Center Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If I’m a company considering making strategic investments, regardless of industry, I don’t want my competition to know where I’m going, what I’m doing, what pace I’m doing it at,” said Braun, a former executive at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. “You want to make sure everything is buttoned up and bow tied before that type of information is put into the public realm.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Questions have swirled around transparency even in communities where local government officials did not sign NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That includes DeForest, which lists “communicate clearly” among its core values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DeForest data center, proposed by Virginia-based QTS Data Centers, is controversial, in part, because the village board would have to annex 1,600 acres in the neighboring town of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At one DeForest Village Board meeting about the project, Village President Jane Cahill Wolfgram said that based on emails she had been receiving from residents, there was “just one thing I think we need to clear up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And you can ask any one of these board members. They will tell you, they just learned about this project in the last couple of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was Nov. 18, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Village Board trustees had been offered one-on-one meetings with the developer some 10 weeks earlier, trustee Jan Steffenhagen-Hahn said in an email to Vienna resident Shawn Haney.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because of the scale of this project,” that’s when residents should have been notified, said Haney, a leader of a group that opposes the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other emails obtained by the group show that DeForest staff were strategizing with QTS representatives and Alliant Energy as early as March 2025 — seven months before announcing the proposal last October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one email, the village planner discussed with QTS representatives when to seek various village approvals, including annexation, while acknowledging that doing so without disclosing “any details of the project or operations will be difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cahill Wolfgram told Wisconsin Watch she in fact had met with QTS on Oct. 1, three weeks before the public announcement. She expressed frustration that many residents are urging trustees to stop the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’ve been brought in from the very early moments of this discussion and they have continued to be front and center of everything we’ve done,” Cahill Wolfgram said. “As village president, I know of nothing that has been done behind the scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A public hearing on the annexation is scheduled for Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state Department of Administration, which reviews annexation proposals and issues advisory opinions, concluded the DeForest annexation is not in the public interest because of concerns over how the village would provide water and sewer services for the annexed area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin has called for state leaders to pause consideration of any data centers until a comprehensive strategy on them is adopted. In part, the coalition said comprehensive planning is needed to avoid more “stranded assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin Watch reported in December that Wisconsin utility ratepayers owe nearly $1 billion for stranded assets — coal power plants that have been or soon will be shut down. A push to provide new energy capacity for data centers poses the risk of creating more stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some states targeting NDAs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Jan. 13 announced new standards aimed at being a “good neighbor in the communities where we build, own and operate our data centers.” It mentioned transparency five times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers called Microsoft’s initial Mount Pleasant data center a “microcosm of a larger problem with secrecy and lack of transparency about water and electricity demands” of data centers throughout the country. That, they wrote, “harms the public’s ability to determine whether hosting a data center is in their best interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Pleasant has wanted a major development where the data center is now under construction because a massive development signed with Foxconn in 2017 largely fell through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local government use of NDAs and other methods to keep data center development secret is widespread across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, local elected officials were aware of data center proposals for months or even years before disclosing them. In Virginia, 25 out of 31 data center projects had NDAs. In one New Mexico county, county staff negotiated for a $165 billion data center with an NDA that kept elected officials in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several states are targeting NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least three — Florida, Michigan and New Jersey — are considering legislation to prohibit governments from signing data center NDAs. A Georgia bill would prohibit NDAs that hide information about data center electricity or water usage. New York is considering a bill to limit NDAs for economic development proposals generally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, similar legislation is pending in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, state Rep. Clint Moses, R-Menomonie, citing questions about transparency over the Menomonie proposal, introduced a bill to prohibit NDAs for data center proposals in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve never seen such overwhelming opposition from all sides of the aisle,” he told Wisconsin Watch, describing constituents’ feelings about data centers and secrecy surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moses said he understands the need for confidentiality in economic development generally, but that because data centers have such widespread impact, public notice is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The earlier the better,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Braun, the data centers coalition leader, said the public should be notified when a data center proposal is ready to be considered for approvals by elected officials — after municipal staff do due diligence to determine whether things such as zoning, utility capacity, water and sewer would make a proposal potentially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Balch, who helped defeat a proposed data center in the Racine County village of Caledonia, where he lives, said the public should be alerted well before local elected officials consider such votes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You have to use your judgment,” he said. “But at some point, you need to realize this is not a normal thing and we need to look out for the residents.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ode to the AA Battery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently this post from @Merocle caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm fixing my iFixit soldering station. I haven't used it for a long time and the battery has gone overdischarge. I hope it will come back to life. Unfortunately, there are no replacements available for sale at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices with built-in rechargeable batteries have been bugging me a lot lately. It's convenient to have a device you can take with you and use anywhere. And with modern Li-ion cells, battery life is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for years, I've noticed the same thing happening to many devices as Merocle mentions above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I purchase the device, charge it to 100%, use it a bit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Knowing Li-ion cells are better off in the 40-80% range, I store the device with the battery at that charge level.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The next time I go to use the device (a few months later), it won't power on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I plug the device in to charge, and 1 in 4 times the device won't start charging!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One problem is many devices don't have a proper BMS integrated into the charging circuit, that will cut power before the battery is below a critical threshold. Li-ion cells start to have problems below 3V, and often suffer permanent damage below 2.5V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices from even the most stalwart right-to-repair companies suffer from undervoltage issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can sometimes revive 'dead' Li-ion batteries, but I don't recommend it unless you know what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming most people don't know what they're doing, when they pull out a piece of gear that won't turn on and has no obvious way of being repaired (especially with odd pouch-cell batteries, much less 18650 cells), these devices will most often end up in the trash. Or if you're lucky, some people will try recycling them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enter the AA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this trend, if I need portability, I look for devices that use AA and AAA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each year for the past 14 years, I buy sets of Panasonic eneloop batteries to replace disposable AA batteries as they die. Eneloops have around 2000 mAh of capacity (versus 2100+ mAh for good alkaline batteries1), and run at a nominal 1.2V instead of the 1.5V of alkaline batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they can be recharged. Over and over. They can be pulled out of a device, with new batteries swapped in quickly. For long term storage, I can pop the batteries out and use them in other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, across 128 batteries, I have not had a single incident of leakage, fire, etc., and even the cells I reserve for outdoor use (in devices that go from -12Â°F in the winter to 105Â°F+ in the summer) are still holding a charge, over a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only one cell has had to be retired, out of all the eneloops I've purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What prompted me to write this post is the soldering project I worked on during this weekend's snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Universal Standards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was putting together this clock at my workbench, and at one point I needed to determine which resistor was 100KÎ© and which was 1MÎ©. I pulled out my Fluke multimeter, inserted two AAA batteries I had sitting on my bench (I keep 8 AA and 8 AAA batteries charged and ready at my workbench, and don't store them in my tools), and measured the resistors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon doing so, I realized the clamp meter I was using (Fluke 323 True RMS Clamp Meter) only measures between 400-4000Î©, so I switched to my old Craftsman meter that worked a treatâand uses a replaceable 9V battery!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be faster to leave the batteries in my tools, but over 40 years of sacrificing devices to alkaline cell leakage, it's my habit not to. So far I've never had leakage problems with the eneloops, but old habits die hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I put away the meter, I noticed my wife's and old Sony Walkman sitting nearby. Just for fun, I popped in two AA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife had both a WM-EX150 (made in 1995) and a WM-FX281. These are 31 and 25 years old, respectivelyâand outside the rubber belts being shot, the devices both work. The radio works good as new, and it would play cassettes again after a little maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AAs might not last 32 hours, and the Walkman doesn't fit in tight jeans pockets, but they can still be as useful today as they were decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at my stack of old tech, every device uses one of the standard AA, AAA, or C-sized batteries. And thinking of all the new devices I've purchased, the ones that worry me the least (regarding fire safety, and whether they're work the next time I pull them out)... are the ones with easily-replaceable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No Batteries at All&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I don't need portability, I prefer USB-C powered tools (with no battery). USB-C is ubiquitous enough I always have a plug available with at least 5, 9, or 12V of power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At every workbench and desk, and in my car and backpack, I have either USB battery packs, or wall plugs, that supply any voltage a device would need, and can supply up to 100W (sometimes more) through a small USB-C connector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I truly need portability, I can rubber-band a battery pack to the device I'm using.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not always ideal, and I wouldn't want a smartphone with such a battery pack, but many of my battery-less devices will outlive me, I am sure, with no risk of burning down my house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Energy Density and Weight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are cases where the energy density, portability, and weight tradeoffs of traditional battery cells don't work out: laptops, tablets, smartphones, watches, extremely lightweight computer mice...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering wireless input devices, though, Apple's 1st gen Magic Trackpad was AA-powered. Apparently Apple considered battery swaps so convenient they didn't even include a USB or Lightning connector2!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can understand when you need a more exotic or thin layout that doesn't lend itself well to cylindrical battery cells. There are laptops that exist with exposed 18650 cells, but they're certainly not for everyone (unless you like portable computing like it's 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I build my own devices, I find myself relying on USB power (if the device lives near a desk or workbench), or integrated AA battery holders (if the device is meant to be portable). Not having to keep a few dozen cheap Li-ion packs sitting in close proximity to my sand bucket is a neat side-benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Project Farm has a great video exploring which AA battery provides the best value / power / longevity. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I still prefer wired connections for my peripherals, though. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Every popular agent framework runs LLM-generated code via &lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;. That's arbitrary code execution on your host. One prompt injection and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;LangChain&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;exec(command, globals, locals)&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CVE-2025-68664, GitHub #5294&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;AutoGen&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run()&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Code Executors docs&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SWE-Agent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run(["bash", ...])&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SWE-ReX&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some frameworks offer Docker isolation (OpenHands, AutoGen), but that requires running a Docker daemon and managing container infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;amla-sandbox is a WASM sandbox with capability enforcement. Agents can only call tools you explicitly provide, with constraints you define. Sandboxed virtual filesystem. No network. No shell escape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv pip install "git+https://github.com/amlalabs/amla-sandbox"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Docker. No VM. One binary, works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[stripe_api, database])

# Agent writes one script instead of 10 tool calls (JavaScript)
result = sandbox.run('''
    const txns = await stripe.listTransactions({customer: "cus_123"});
    const disputed = txns.filter(t =&amp;gt; t.disputed);
    console.log(disputed[0]);
''', language="javascript")

# Or with shell pipelines
result = sandbox.run('''
    tool stripe.listTransactions --customer cus_123 | jq '[.[] | select(.disputed)] | .[0]'
''', language="shell")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tool-calling is expensive. Every MCP call is a round trip through the model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → tool → LLM → tool → LLM → tool → ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten tool calls = ten LLM invocations. Code mode collapses this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → script that does all 10 things → result
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can't just eval whatever the model spits out. So people either pay the token tax or run unsafe code. This gives you both: code-mode efficiency with actual isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox runs inside WebAssembly with WASI for a minimal syscall interface. WASM provides memory isolation by design—linear memory is bounds-checked, and there's no way to escape to the host address space. The wasmtime runtime we use is built with defense-in-depth and has been formally verified for memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of WASM isolation, every tool call goes through capability validation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import Sandbox, MethodCapability, ConstraintSet, Param

sandbox = Sandbox(
    capabilities=[
        MethodCapability(
            method_pattern="stripe/charges/*",
            constraints=ConstraintSet([
                Param("amount") &amp;lt;= 10000,
                Param("currency").is_in(["USD", "EUR"]),
            ]),
            max_calls=100,
        ),
    ],
    tool_handler=my_handler,
)

# This works
sandbox.execute('await stripe.charges.create({amount: 500, currency: "USD"})')

# This fails - amount exceeds capability
sandbox.execute('await stripe.charges.create({amount: 50000, currency: "USD"})')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design draws from capability-based security as implemented in systems like seL4—access is explicitly granted, not implicitly available. Agents don't get ambient authority just because they're running in your process. This matters because prompt injection is a fundamental unsolved problem; defense in depth through capability restriction limits the blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool()

# JavaScript
sandbox.run("console.log('hello'.toUpperCase())", language="javascript")  # -&amp;gt; "HELLO"

# Shell
sandbox.run("echo 'hello' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'", language="shell")  # -&amp;gt; "HELLO"

# With tools
def get_weather(city: str) -&amp;gt; dict:
    return {"city": city, "temp": 72}

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[get_weather])
sandbox.run("const w = await get_weather({city: 'SF'}); console.log(w);", language="javascript")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(
    tools=[transfer_money],
    constraints={
        "transfer_money": {
            "amount": "&amp;lt;=1000",
            "currency": ["USD", "EUR"],
        },
    },
    max_calls={"transfer_money": 10},
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools require object syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// WORKS - tools always take an object argument
await get_weather({city: "SF"});
await transfer({to: "alice", amount: 500});

// FAILS - positional arguments don't work
await get_weather("SF");  // Error: argument after ** must be a mapping&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; for output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Return value is captured and output
return await get_weather({city: "SF"});  // -&amp;gt; {"city":"SF","temp":72}
return {a: 1, b: 2};  // -&amp;gt; {"a":1,"b":2}
return "hello";  // -&amp;gt; hello (strings not double-quoted)

// console.log also works
console.log(JSON.stringify({a: 1}));  // -&amp;gt; {"a":1}

// No return = no output
const x = 42;  // -&amp;gt; (no output)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VFS is writable only under /workspace and /tmp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// WORKS - /workspace and /tmp are ReadWrite
await fs.writeFile('/workspace/data.json', '{}');
await fs.mkdir('/tmp/cache');

// FAILS - root is read-only
await fs.mkdir('/mydir');  // EACCES: Permission denied&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For LangGraph integration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[get_weather, search_db])
agent = create_react_agent(
    ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    [sandbox.as_langchain_tool()]  # LLM writes JS/shell that calls your tools
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fine-grained capability control:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import SandboxTool, MethodCapability, ConstraintSet, Param

caps = [
    MethodCapability(
        method_pattern="mcp:search_db",
        constraints=ConstraintSet([Param("query").starts_with("SELECT")]),
        max_calls=5,
    )
]

sandbox_tool = SandboxTool.from_functions([search_db], capabilities=caps)
agent = create_react_agent(model, [sandbox_tool.as_langchain_tool()])&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox yields on tool calls. Host executes them (after capability checks) and resumes. QuickJS runs inside WASM for the JS runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First run compiles the WASM module (~300ms). Cache it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;amla-precompile&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subsequent loads: ~0.5ms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import Param, ConstraintSet

constraints = ConstraintSet([
    Param("amount") &amp;gt;= 100,
    Param("amount") &amp;lt;= 10000,
    Param("currency").is_in(["USD", "EUR"]),
    Param("path").starts_with("/api/"),
])&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pattern matching for method names:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;stripe/charges/create&lt;/code&gt;— exact match&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;stripe/charges/*&lt;/code&gt;— single path segment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;stripe/**&lt;/code&gt;— zero or more segments&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you get: Isolation without infrastructure. Capability enforcement. Token efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you don't get: Full Linux environment. Native module support. GPU access. Infinite loop protection (a &lt;code&gt;while(true){}&lt;/code&gt; will hang - the step limit only counts WASM yields, not JS instructions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need a real VM with persistent state and arbitrary dependencies, use e2b or Modal. amla-sandbox is for the common case: agents running generated code with controlled tool access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python code is MIT. The WASM binary is proprietary—you can use it with this package but can't extract or redistribute it separately.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wallace and Gromit Font&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Categories:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new typeface for Aardman’s iconic duo – meet Buttered Crumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to be selected to design a custom typeface for Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit – Aardman’s most beloved and recognisable characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brief called for a font with a distinct tone of voice that could work seamlessly across film, print and digital, while bringing warmth and continuity to their next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Method&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We began by exploring warm, characterful styles, taking inspiration from Oswald Cooper’s original drawings for Cooper Black. We then took a creative turn, developing a softer, low-contrast design with a distinctly hand-crafted feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each letterform was carefully shaped to feel expressive yet balanced, with serifs that resemble loaves of bread – a nod to Aardman’s tactile, playful world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outcomes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The finished typeface – Buttered Crumpet – gives Aardman a timeless, familiar tone of voice with bundles of charm. It includes over 200 characters, covering all Western European languages, and was designed in a single, carefully crafted weight with room for future expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Bristol-based designer, it was a joy to create a lasting connection with my home city and one of its most renowned creative studios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I’ve loved rolling out this typeface and we’re starting to see it in action now. There have been lots of compliments.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How does Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemonade is the first to reward safer self-driving miles with real discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemonade is the first to reward safer self-driving miles with real discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance is the first car insurance designed specifically for self-driving cars. It offers Tesla owners 50% off every mile driven using Full Self-Driving technology by automatically tracking FSD miles versus manual miles through direct Tesla integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance is built on a simple principle: Tesla’s data shows that Full Self-Driving miles are twice as safe as manual driving, so they should cost 50% less on your insurance premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you drive using Tesla’s FSD technology, our system automatically tracks those miles and applies the discount. Manual miles are priced normally, while your FSD miles get the full 50% reduction, creating a pricing model that actually reflects the safety benefits of autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional car insurance that relies on estimates, Lemonade connects directly to your Tesla using Tesla’s Fleet API, which gives Lemonade access to vehicle data with a customer’s permission. This means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technology handles everything behind the scenes, so you just drive and save.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance is currently available for Tesla drivers in Arizona and launching in Oregon on February 26, 2026, with more states coming soon. To qualify, your Tesla needs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional insurers might offer small discounts for safety features like adaptive cruise control or lane-keeping assistance, but they don’t distinguish between these basic driver assistance systems and sophisticated autonomous driving technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemonade recognizes that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving represents a fundamentally different level of automation, one that deserves a fundamentally different insurance approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla reports that FSD technology leads to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren’t theoretical benefits, they’re real safety improvements that Lemonade’s pricing reflects. When autonomous driving technology demonstrably reduces risk, insurance costs should follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of estimating your annual mileage and hoping for the best, Lemonade’s system knows exactly how many miles you drive in FSD mode versus manual mode. This usage-based insurance model means you pay precisely for the risk you represent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As car manufacturers like Ford, GM, and others advance their autonomous driving technology, Lemonade is building the infrastructure to support them. Our approach with Tesla creates the foundation for insuring all types of self-driving vehicles as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you own a Tesla with Hardware 4.0 or higher in an eligible state, you can start saving immediately with Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance. The 50% discount applies to every mile you drive using Full Self-Driving, potentially reducing your overall insurance costs significantly depending on how often you use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance works alongside our other products, so Tesla owners can bundle their autonomous coverage with homeowners, renters, pet, or term life insurance for additional discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting started with Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything is managed through the Lemonade app, with transparent tracking of your FSD miles and savings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a current Tesla owner interested in Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance or considering buying a Tesla to take advantage of this innovative coverage, Lemonade makes the process simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our autonomous car insurance represents the future of auto insurance, pricing that actually reflects the safety benefits of new technology, seamless integration with cutting-edge vehicles, and transparent, fair coverage that evolves with your driving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ready to see how much you could save with the first insurance designed specifically for autonomous vehicles? Get a quote today and discover why safer miles should cost less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll save 50% on every mile driven using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology. Your total savings depend on how often you use FSD versus manual driving, but many drivers see significant reductions in their overall insurance premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No special policies are required: Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance integrates with regular car insurance requirements. We simply price your FSD miles at 50% less than manual miles because they’re demonstrably safer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your Tesla needs Hardware 4.0 or higher and firmware version 2025.44.25.5 or newer. The firmware update is free and easy to install through your Tesla app or directly in your car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing customers can add autonomous coverage at their next renewal. We don’t recommend canceling your current policy early, as you’d pay unnecessary fees for a new policy setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re working to expand to more states as quickly as possible while ensuring compliance with local regulations. Follow our updates for announcements about new state availability.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft Just Killed the "Cover for Me" Excuse: 365 Now Tracks You in Real-Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, we all knew it was coming, but now it's official. Microsoft just handed middle managers the ultimate weapon. Their new update for Microsoft 365 allows companies to track exactly where you are, and the days of pretending to be at your desk are over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Death of the "Tech Bro" Excuse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember when you could text Dave from the office to turn your PC on because you were stuck in traffic? Yeah, those days are dead. Dead and buried.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed that starting March 2026 (delayed from January), managers will be able to see your real-time location. And no, disconnecting from the office Wi-Fi won't save you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This "feature" is hitting everything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Teams on Windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Teams on Mac&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And obviously, the mobile app (your pocket spy).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here is the scary part&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just about being at the office. It’s about where you are when you aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you connect to a Wi-Fi network that isn't your company's, Teams will simply display the name of that network. So if you decide to take a "working lunch" and connect to "Starbucks_Guest_WiFi", your boss sees it instantly. You can’t hide behind a generic "Remote" status anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They call it "coordination." I call it creepy. It feels a lot like a digital ankle monitor. For hybrid workers or anyone who values a shred of privacy, Microsoft 365 just became a lot more invasive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In a press conference this week on New York City’s $12 billion budget gap, Mayor Zohran Mamdani zeroed in on the previous administration’s artificial intelligence chatbot as one of “a number of different things we’re going to pursue for savings.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chatbot, which was released by the Eric Adams administration in fall of 2023, was meant to provide business owners with an accessible way to check city rules and regulations. But as first documented by The Markup and THE CITY, the bot provided answers that, if followed, would lead to illegal behavior by businesses, like taking a cut of employees’ tips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the mayor, Dora Pekec, confirmed in a text message that the new administration plans to take down the chatbot. She said a member of the Mamdani transition team had seen reporting on the bot from The Markup and THE CITY and presented it to the mayor as a possible place to save funds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;NYC’s AI Chatbot Tells Businesses to Break the Law&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-powered bot says bosses can take workers’ tips and that landlords can discriminate based on source of income&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the press conference, Mamdani blamed Adams for the budget shortfall, saying he had been handed “a poisoned chalice.” To close the deficit, he said he would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations and look “under the hood” of the city’s budget for potential savings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When pressed by reporters on what he might cut, he singled out the chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The previous administration had an AI chatbot that was functionally unusable,” Mamdani said. “It was costing the administration around half a million dollars. That, in and of itself, is not something that can bridge this kind of a gap, but it’s an indication of the ways in which money has been spent while refusing to account for the actual costs of what these programs are.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bot, built using Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, was part of an ambitious overhaul of digital services in New York called MyCity. The project was meant to streamline access to government but was criticized for relying on outside contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t clear how much it cost to maintain the chatbot. Just building the bot’s foundations reportedly cost nearly $600,000, close to the figure Mamdani provided. Pekec said they didn’t yet have a date for taking down the bot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A broken bot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing by The Markup and THE CITY in 2024 showed that, despite promises from the Adams administration, the chatbot would confidently provide incorrect and potentially harmful information to visitors, even on high-stakes topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked about housing policy, for example, the bot suggested landlords could discriminate against tenants with Section 8 vouchers. Despite being an intended resource for business owners, the bot didn’t know the minimum wage, and told users it was fine to refuse to accept cash for payment despite a city law to the contrary, enacted in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After The Markup and THE CITY’s initial report was published, readers continued peppering the bot with sometimes farcical questions, which it continued failing to answer properly. The Adams administration defended the bot, saying it would improve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re identifying what the problems are, we’re gonna fix them, and we’re going to have the best chatbot system on the globe,” Adams said at a press conference. “People are going to come and watch what we’re doing in New York City.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;City administrators soon added disclaimers to the bot advising users to “not use its responses as legal or professional advice.” They also improved some of the bot’s answers, but also appeared to limit the kinds of questions the tool was willing to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the bot advises visitors to “ask an NYC government question only” and cautions that “responses may occasionally produce inaccurate or incomplete content.” Visitors must agree to accept the bot’s limitations before using it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent federal raid on the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson isn’t merely an attack by the Trump administration on the free press. It’s also a warning to anyone with a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Included in the search and seizure warrant for the raid on Natanson’s home is a section titled “Biometric Unlock,” which explicitly authorized law enforcement personnel to obtain Natanson’s phone and both hold the device in front of her face and to forcibly use her fingers to unlock it. In other words, a judge gave the FBI permission to attempt to bypass biometrics: the convenient shortcuts that let you unlock your phone by scanning your fingerprint or face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not clear if Natanson used biometric authentication on her devices, or if the law enforcement personnel attempted to use her face or fingers to unlock her devices. Natanson and the Washington Post did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The FBI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Natanson has not been charged with a crime. Investigators searched her home in connection with alleged communication between her and government contractor Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, who was initially charged with unlawfully retaining national defense information. Prosecutors recently added new charges including multiple counts of transmission of defense information to an unauthorized person. Attorneys for Perez-Lugones did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The warrant included a few stipulations limiting law enforcement personnel. Investigators were not authorized to ask Natanson details about what kind of biometric authentication she may have used on her devices. For instance, the warrant explicitly stated they could not ask Natanson which specific finger she uses for biometrics, if any. Although if Natanson were to voluntarily provide any such information, that would be allowed, according to the warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept that while the EFF has “seen warrants that authorize police to compel individuals to unlock their devices using biometrics in the past,” the caveat mandating that the subject of the search cannot be asked for specifics about their biometric setup is likely influenced by recent case law. “Last year the D.C. Circuit held that biometric unlocking can be a form of ‘testimony’ that is protected by the 5th Amendment,” Crocker said. This is especially the case when a person is “forced to demonstrate which finger unlocks the device.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crocker said that he “would like to see courts treat biometric locks as equivalent to password protection from a constitutional standpoint. Your constitutional right against self-incrimination should not be dependent on technical convenience or lack thereof.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Activists and journalists have long been cautioned to disable biometrics in specific situations where they might face heightened risk of losing control of their phones, say when attending a protest or crossing a border. Martin Shelton, deputy director of digital security at Freedom of the Press Foundation, advised “journalists to disable biometrics when they expect to be in a situation where they expect a possible search.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of using biometrics, it’s safest to unlock your devices using an alphanumeric passphrase (a device protected solely by a passcode consisting of numbers is generally easier to access). There are numerous other safeguards to take if there’s a possibility your home may be raided, such as turning off your phone before going to bed, which puts it into an encrypted state until the next time it’s unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few specific circumstances when biometric-based authentication methods might make sense from a privacy perspective — such as in a public place where someone might spy on your passphrase over your shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
