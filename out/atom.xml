    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI and the ironies of automation - Part 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some (well-known) consequences of AI automating work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI and the ironies of automation - Part 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous post, we discussed several observations, Lisanne Bainbridge made in her much-noticed paper “The ironies of automation”, she published in 1983 and what they mean for the current “white-collar” work automation attempts leveraging LLMs and AI agents based on LLMs, still requiring humans in the loop. We stopped at the end of the first chapter, “Introduction”, of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, we will continue with the second chapter, “Approaches to solutions”, and see what we can learn there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comparing apples and oranges?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, before we start: Some of the observations and recommendations made in the paper must be taken with a grain of salt when applying them to the AI-based automation attempts of today. When monitoring an industrial production plant, it is often a matter of seconds until a human operator must act if something goes wrong to avoid severe or even catastrophic accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is of the highest importance to design industrial control stations in a way that a human operator can recognize deviations and malfunctions as easily as possible and immediately trigger countermeasures. A lot of work is put into the design of all the displays and controls, like, e.g., the well-known emergency stop switch in a screaming red color that is big enough to be punched with a flat hand, fist or alike within a fraction of a second if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to AI-based solutions automating white-collar work, we usually do not face such critical conditions. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the observations and recommendations in the paper easily because, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most companies are efficiency-obsessed. Hence, they also expect AI solutions to increase “productivity”, i.e., efficiency, to a superhuman level. If a human is meant to monitor the output of the AI and intervene if needed, this requires that the human needs to comprehend what the AI solution produced at superhuman speed – otherwise we are down to human speed. This presents a quandary that can only be solved if we enable the human to comprehend the AI output at superhuman speed (compared to producing the same output by traditional means).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most companies have a tradition of nurturing a culture of urgency and scarcity, resulting in a lot of pressure towards and stress for the employees. Stress is known to trigger the fight-or-flight mode (an ancient survival mechanism built into us to cope with dangerous situations) which massively reduces the normal cognitive capacity of a human. While this mechanism supports humans in making very quick decisions and taking quick actions (essential in dangerous situations), it deprives them of the ability to conduct any deeper analysis (not being essential in dangerous situations). If deeper analysis is required to make a decision, this may take a lot longer than without stress – if possible at all. This means we need to enable humans to conduct deeper analysis under stress as well or to provide the information in a way that eliminates the need for deeper analysis (which is not always possible).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we let this sink in (plus a few other aspects, I did not write down here but you most likely will add in your mind), we quickly come to the conclusion that also in our AI-related automation context humans are often expected to make quick decisions and act based on them, often under conditions that make it hard (if not impossible) to conduct any in-depth analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we then also take into account, that depending on the situation a wrong result produced by an AI solution which eluded the human operator may have severe consequences in the worst case (e.g., assume a major security incident due to a missed wrongdoing of the AI solution), the situation is not that far away anymore from the situation in an industrial plant’s control station.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summarizing, we surely need to add the necessary grain of salt, i.e., ask ourselves how strict the timing constraints in our specific setting are to avoid comparing apples and oranges in the worst case. However, in general we need to consider the whole range of possible settings which will – probably more often than we think – include that humans need to make decisions in a very short time under stressful conditions (which makes things more precarious).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The worst UI possible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brings us immediately to Lisanne Bainbridge’s first recommendation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In any situation where a low probability event must be noticed quickly then the operator must be given artificial assistance, if necessary even alarms on alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, the system must support the human operator as well as possible in detecting a problem, especially if it tends to occur rarely. It is a consequence of the “monitoring fatigue” problem we discussed in the previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the learnings people have made, a lot of effort has been put into the design of the displays, the controls and also the alerting mechanisms of industrial production control stations, making sure the human operators can make their jobs as good, as stress-free and as reliable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual idea is that a single human controls a fleet of AI agents that are designed to do some kind of job, e.g., writing code. Sometimes, most agents are generic “workers”, orchestrated by some kind of supervisor that delegates parts of the work to the worker agents. Sometimes, the different agents are “specialists”, each for a certain aspect of the job to be done, that collaborate using some kind of choreography (or are also orchestrated by a supervisor). While the generic workers are easier to set up, the specialized workers usually produce more accurate results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because these AI-based agents sometimes produce errors, a human – in our example a software developer – needs to supervise the AI agent fleet and ideally intervenes before the AI agents do something they should not do. Therefore, the AI agents typically create a plan of what they intend to do first (which as a side effect also increases the likelihood that they do not drift off). Then, the human verifies the plan and approves it if it is correct, and the AI agents execute the plan. If the plan is not correct, the human rejects it and sends the agents back to replanning, providing information about what needs to be altered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us take Lisanne Bainbridge’s recommendation and compare it to this approach that is currently “best practice” to control an AI agent fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless we tell them to act differently, LLMs and also AI agents based on them are quite chatty. Additionally, they tend to communicate with an air of utter conviction. Thus, they present to you this highly detailed, multi-step plan of what they intend to do, including lots of explanations, in this perfectly convinced tone. Often, these plans are more than 50 or 100 lines of text, sometimes even several hundred lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the time, the plans are fine. However, sometimes the AI agents mess things up. They make wrong conclusions, or they forget what they are told to do and drift off – not very often, but it happens. Sometimes the problem is obvious at first sight. But more often, it is neatly hidden somewhere behind line 123: “… and because 2 is bigger than 3, it is clear, we need to &amp;lt; do something critical &amp;gt;”. But because it is so much text the agents flood you with all the time and because the error is hidden so well behind this wall of conviction, we miss it – and the AI agent does something critical wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We cannot blame the person for missing the error in the plan. The problem is that this is probably the worst UI and UX possible for anyone who is responsible for avoiding errors in a system that rarely produces errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But LLM-based agents make errors all the time, you may say. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they do. And the better the instructions and the setup of the interacting agents, the fewer errors they produce. Additionally, we can expect more specialized and refined agents in the future that become increasingly better in their respective areas of expertise. Still, most likely they will never become completely error-free because of the underlying technology that cannot guarantee consistent correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the setting we need to ponder if we talk about the user interface for a human observer: a setting where the agent fleet only rarely makes errors but we still need a human monitoring and intervening if things should go wrong. It is not yet clear how such an interface should look like, but most definitely not as it looks now. Probably we could harvest some good insights from our UX/UI design colleagues for industrial production plant control stations. We would need only to ask them …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The training paradox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisanne Bainbridge then makes several recommendations regarding the required training of the human operator. This again is a rich section, and I can only recommend reading it on your own because it contains several subtle yet important hints that are hard to bring across without citing the whole chapter. Here, I will highlight only a few aspects. She starts with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[Some points made in the previous section] make it clear that it can be important to maintain manual skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then she talks about letting the human operator take over control regularly, i.e., do the job instead of the machine as a very effective training option. Actually, without doing hands-on work regularly, the skills of a human expert deteriorate surprisingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if taking over the work regularly is not an option, e.g., because we want continuous superhuman productivity leveraging AI agents (no matter if it makes sense or not), we still need to make sure that the human operator can take over if needed. In such a setting, training must take place in some other way, usually using some kind of simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there is a problem with simulators, especially if human intervention is only needed (and wanted) if things do not work as expected:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are problems with the use of any simulator to train for extreme situations. Unknown faults cannot be simulated, and system behaviour may not be known for faults which can be predicted but have not been experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consequence of this issue is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This means that training must be concerned with general strategies rather than specific responses […]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is inadequate to expect the operator to react to unfamiliar events solely by consulting operating procedures. These cannot cover all the possibilities, so the operator is expected to monitor them and fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which leaves us with the irony:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, it is ironic to train operators in following instructions and then put them in the system to provide intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a problem we will need to face with AI agents and their supervising humans in the future, too. The supervising experts are meant to intervene whenever things become messy, whenever the AI agents get stuck, often in unforeseen ways. These are not regular tasks. Often, these are also not the issues we expect an AI agent to run into and thus can provide training for. These are extraordinary situations, the ones we do not expect – and the more refined and specialized the AI agents will become in the future, the more often the issues that require human intervention will be of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question is twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How can we train human operators at all to be able to intervene skillfully in exceptional, usually hard to solve situations?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How can we train a human operator so that their skills remain sharp over time and they remain able to address an exceptional situation quickly and resourcefully?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The questions seem to hint at a sort of paradox, and an answer to both questions is all but obvious. At the moment, we still have enough experienced subject matter experts that the questions may feel of lower importance. But if we only start to address the questions when they become pressing, they will be even harder – if not impossible – to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To end this consideration with the words of Lisanne Bainbridge:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the final irony is that it is the most successful automated systems, with rare need for manual intervention, which may need the greatest investment in human operator training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, we cannot simply take a few available human experts and make them supervise agents that took over their work without any further investments in the humans. Instead, we need to train them continuously, and the better the agents become, the more expensive the training of the supervisors will become. I highly doubt that decision makers who primarily think about saving money when it comes to AI agents are aware of this irony.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Interlude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I wrote in the beginning of first part of this blog series, “The ironies of automation” is a very rich and dense paper. We are still only at the end of the second chapter “Approaches to solutions” which is two and a half pages into the paper and there is still a whole third chapter called “Human-computer collaboration” which takes up another page until we get to the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this third chapter also contains a lot of valuable advice that goes well beyond our focus here, I will leave it to you to read it on your own. As I indicated at the beginning, this paper is more than worth the time spent on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The leadership dilemma&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, before finishing this little blog series, I would like to mention a new kind of dilemma that Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper because the situation was a bit different with industrial production plant automation than with AI-agent-based automation. But as this topic fits nicely into the just-finished training paradox section, I decided to add it here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue is that just monitoring an AI agent fleet doing its work and intervening if things go wrong usually is not sufficient, at least not yet. All the things discussed before apply, but there is more to interacting with AI agents because we cannot simply be reactive with AI agents. We cannot simply watch them doing their work and only intervene if things go wrong. Instead, we additionally need to be proactive with them: We need to direct them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to tell the AI agents what to do, what not to do, which chunks to pick and so on. This is basically a leadership role. While you do not lead humans, the kind of work is quite similar: You are responsible for the result; you are allowed to set directions and constraints, but you do not immediately control the work. You only control it through communicating with the agents and trying to direct them in the right direction with orders, with feedback, with changed orders, with setting different constraints, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a skill set most people do not have naturally. Usually, they need to develop it over time. Typically, before people are put in a leadership role directing humans, they will get a lot of leadership training teaching them the skills and tools needed to lead successfully. For most people, this is essential because if they come from the receiving end of orders (in the most general sense of “orders”), typically they are not used to setting direction and constraints. This tends to be a completely new skill they need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does not apply only to leading humans but also to leading AI agents. While AI agents are not humans, and thus leadership will be different in detail, the basic skills and tools needed are the same. This is, BTW, one of the reasons why the people who praise agentic AI on LinkedIn and the like are very often managers who lead (human) teams. For them, leading an AI agent fleet feels very natural because it is very close to the work they do every day. However, for the people currently doing the work, leading an AI agent fleet usually does not feel natural at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I have not yet seen anyone receiving any kind of leadership training before being left alone with a fleet of AI agents, and I still see little discussion about the issue. “If it does not work properly, you need better prompts” is the usual response if someone struggles with directing agents successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, but it is not that easy. The issue is much bigger than just optimizing a few prompts. The issue is that people have to change their approach completely to get any piece of work done. Instead of doing it directly, they need to learn how to get it done indirectly. They need to learn how to direct a group of AI agents effectively, how to lead them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also adds to the training irony of the previous topic. Maybe the AI agent fleets will become good enough in the future that we can omit the proactive part of the work and only need to focus on the reactive part of the work, the monitor-and-intervene part. But until then, we need to teach human supervisors of AI agent fleets how to lead them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moving on&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We discussed several ironies and paradoxes from Lisanne Bainbridge’s “The ironies of automation” and how they also apply to agentic AI. We looked at the unlearning and recall dilemma and what it means for the next generation of human supervisors. We discussed monitoring fatigue and the status issue. We looked at the UX and UI deficiencies of current AI agents and the training paradox. And we finally looked at the leadership dilemma, which Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper but which complements the training paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to conclude with the conclusion of Lisanne Bainbridge:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[…] humans working without time-pressure can be impressive problem solvers. The difficulty remains that they are less effective when under time pressure. I hope this paper has made clear both the irony that one is not by automating necessarily removing the difficulties, and also the possibility that resolving them will require even greater technological ingenuity than does classic automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could not agree more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think over time we will become clear on how much “The ironies of automation” also applies to automation done with AI agents and that we cannot ignore the insights known for more than 40 years meanwhile. I am also really curious how the solutions to the ironies and paradoxes will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until then, I hope I gave you a bit of food for thought to ponder. If you should have some good ideas regarding the ironies and how to address them, please do not hesitate to share them with the community. We learn best by sharing and discussing, and maybe your contribution will be a step towards solving the issues discussed …&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Price of a bot army revealed across hundreds of online platforms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introducing the Cambridge Online Trust and Safety Index&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The first global index to track real-time prices for buying fake account verifications on 500+ online platforms in every country.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new site that tracks the daily fluctuating costs behind buying a bot army on over 500 social media and commercial platforms – from TikTok to Amazon and Spotify – in every nation on the planet is launched by the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time, the Cambridge Online Trust and Safety Index (COTSI) allows the global community to monitor real-time market data for the “online manipulation economy”: the SIM farms that mass-produce fake accounts for scammers and social bots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These markets openly sell SMS message verifications for fake profiles across hundreds of sites, providing a service for “inauthentic activity” ranging from vanity metrics boosts and rage-bait accounts to coordinated influence campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new analysis using twelve months of COTSI data, published in the journal Science, shows that verifying fake accounts for use in the US and UK is almost as cheap as in Russia, while Japan and Australia have high prices due to SIM costs and photo ID rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average price of SMS verification for an online platform during the year-long study period running to July 2025 was $4.93 in Japan and $3.24 in Australia, yet just a fraction of that in the US ($0.26), UK ($0.10) and Russia ($0.08).*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research also reveals that prices for fake accounts on Telegram and WhatsApp appear to spike in countries about to have national elections, suggesting a surge in demand due to “influence operations”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The COTSI team, based in Cambridge’s Social Decision-Making Lab, includes experts in misinformation and cryptocurrency. They argue that SIM card regulation could help “disincentivise” online manipulation, and say their tool can be used to test policy interventions the world over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team suggest that platforms should add labels showing an account’s country of origin for transparency, as recently done on X, but also point out such measures can be circumvented – a service provided by many vendors in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We find a thriving underground market through which inauthentic content, artificial popularity, and political influence campaigns are readily and openly for sale,” said Dr Jon Roozenbeek, study co-lead and senior author from the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Bots can be used to generate online attention for selling a product, a celebrity, a political candidate, or an idea. This can be done by simulating grassroots support online, or generating controversy to harvest clicks and game the algorithms.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“All this activity requires fake accounts, and each one starts with a phone number and the SIM hardware to support it. That dependency creates a choke point we can target to gauge the hidden economics of online manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Co-lead author Anton Dek, a researcher at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, said: “Misinformation is subject to disagreement across the political spectrum. Whatever the nature of inauthentic online activity, much of it is funnelled through this manipulation market, so we can simply follow the money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“A sophisticated bot can run an influence campaign through hundreds of fake accounts”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Jon Roozenbeek&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Murky global market&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To register a new account, online platforms require SMS (Short Message Service) verification: a text message containing a code sent to a valid phone number. This is intended to confirm a human is setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, a murky global marketplace has emerged with the infrastructure to bypass this security protocol, and automatically generate and sell fake accounts in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies claiming to offer privacy solutions operate “farms” of thousands of SIM cards and SIM banks – both real and virtual – to provide SMS verifications and re-route web traffic though mobile networks to disguise its origin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fake accounts bought from this “transnational grey market” of informal businesses, often based in jurisdictions with little legal oversight, are central to online scams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This market is also behind many malicious bot campaigns now dominating propaganda and PR dark arts, according to Cambridge researchers. “A sophisticated bot can run an influence campaign through hundreds of fake accounts,” said Roozenbeek.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Generative AI means that bots can now adapt messages to appear more human and even tailor them to relate to other accounts. Bot armies are getting more persuasive and harder to spot.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, a study last year uncovered a botnet of 1,140 accounts on X using generative AI to run automated conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fake account index&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team built COTSI with opensource data pulled from some of the world’s biggest fake account suppliers. Researchers identified seventeen vendors and sorted by traffic to focus on the top ten. Four of these are used at any one time to construct the global price index, with others kept in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, COTSI monitors not just prices but also the available “stock” of fake accounts listed by each vendor in every country for hundreds of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These include all social media channels, as well as cash, dating and gaming apps, cryptocurrency exchanges and sharing economy sites such as AirBnB, music and video streaming services, ride-hailing apps such as Uber, and accounts for major brands such as Nike and McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One SIM card can be used for hundreds of different platforms,” said Dek. “Vendors recoup SIM costs by selling high-demand verifications for apps like Facebook and Telegram, then profit from the long tail of other platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional analyses show global stocks of fake accounts are highest for platforms such as X, Uber, Discord, Amazon, Tinder and gaming platform Steam, while vendors keep millions of verifications available for the UK and US, along with Brazil and Canada.**&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta, Grindr, and Shopify rank among platforms with the cheapest fake accounts for sale, at a global average of $0.08 per verification. This is followed by X and Instagram at an average of $0.10 per account, TikTok and LinkedIn at $0.11, and Amazon at $0.12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the market themselves, with mixed results. Attempting to verify fake US Facebook accounts only worked 21% of the time with one big provider, but over 90% with another. Much of this difference comes down to virtual versus physical SIMs.***&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fingerprinting by some platforms can mean IP addresses get banned if registration fails,” said Dek. “High-quality verifications involve a physical SIM, requiring huge banks of phones. Nations in which SIM cards are more expensive have higher prices for fake accounts. This is likely to suppress rates of malicious online activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“The COTSI shines a light on the shadow economy of online manipulation by turning a hidden market into measurable data”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prof Sander van der Linden&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-election prices&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To investigate if political influence operations can be seen in these markets, the team analysed price and availability of SMS verifications for eight major social media platforms in the 30 days leading up to 61 national elections held around the world between summer 2024 and the following summer.****&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They found that fake account prices shot up for direct messaging apps Telegram and WhatsApp during election run-ups the world over, likely driven by demand. An account on Telegram increased in price by an average of 12%, and by 15% on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accounts on these apps are tied to visible phone numbers, making it easy to see the country of origin. As such, those behind influence operations must register fake accounts locally, say researchers, increasing demand for SMS verifications in targeted nations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, where no link between price and elections was found, fake accounts can be registered in one country and used in another. They also have greater reach which keeps demand high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A fake Facebook account registered in Russia can post about the US elections and most users will be none the wiser. This isn’t true of apps like Telegram and WhatsApp,” said Roozenbeek.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Telegram is widely used for influence operations, particularly by state actors such as Russia, who invested heavily in information warfare on the channel.” WhatsApp and Telegram are among platforms with consistently expensive fake accounts, averaging $1.02 and $0.89 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Shadow economy’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The manipulation market’s big players have major customer bases in China and the Russian Federation, say the research team, who point out that Russian and Chinese payment systems are often used, and the grammar on many sites suggests Russian authorship. These vendors sell accounts registered in countries around the world.*****&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is hard to see state-level political actors at work, as they often rely on closed-loop infrastructure. However, we suspect some of this is still outsourced to smaller players in the manipulation market,” said Dek.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small vendors resell and broker existing accounts, or manually create and “farm” accounts. The larger players will provide a one-stop shop and offer bulk order services for follower numbers or fake accounts, and even have customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2022 study co-authored by Dek showed that around ten Euros on average (just over ten US dollars) can buy some 90,000 fake views or 200 fake comments for a typical social media post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The COTSI shines a light on the shadow economy of online manipulation by turning a hidden market into measurable data,” added co-author of the new Science paper Prof Sander van der Linden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Understanding the cost of online manipulation is the first step to dismantling the business model behind misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*The data used in the study published in Science, as well as the additional analyses, was collected between 25 July 2024 and 27 July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;** In April 2025, the UK became the first country in Europe to pass legislation making SIM farms illegal. Researchers say that COTSI can be used to track the effects of this law once it is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*** Lead author Anton Dek explains: “By virtual SIM, we mean virtual phone numbers typically provided by Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) or Internet-of-Things connectivity providers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These services make it easy to purchase thousands of numbers for business purposes. Such numbers are usually inexpensive per unit, but they often carry metadata indicating that they belong to a CPaaS provider, and many platforms have learned to block verifications coming from them. On the other hand, when a physical SIM card (or eSIM) from a conventional carrier is used, it is much harder to distinguish from a normal consumer’s number.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;**** The platforms used were Google/YouTube/Gmail; Facebook; Instagram; Twitter/X; WhatsApp; TikTok; LinkedIn; Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;***** A recent law passed by the Russian Federation banned third-party account registrations, which saw vendors suspend SMS verification registered in Russia alone as of September 2025. However, this has not stopped vendors operating from Russia offering services linked to other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s “Hotwire for command-line apps”, meaning you can ship a CLI in a Rails app without building an API. The dream is to make it work for all major web frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminalwire streams stdio, browser launch commands, and a few more things needs to ship a CLI for a SaaS quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best part is when you want to ship a feature for the CLI, you don’t have to worry about pushing out updates to clients and making sure it’s compatible with your API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more interesting development are companies that are using it as a replacement for MCP in AI stacks. They’re reporting less token usage and better overall results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An PWA primarily for my wife and my daughter. They can order their hot chocolate and their coffee as if they were going to grab something at a fancy café downtown, but instead it's at home and I'm the barista. It is quite nice to have for when my wife comes back from work and want something specific, or when we are waiting for the visit of a few friend, they can order exactly the available beverages and everything is ready when they're here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was also a good playground for me to implement Web Push notifications (to never miss new orders).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a basic Nuxt 3 app with Appwrite as the backend with rough edges, but much enough for our household use !&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LOVE this. Are there any plans to open-source? I'd love to run my own instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also some feedback: the ordering buttons are inexplicably in french despite everything else being in English. Choice of language or defaulting to English would be expected...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also - multi-select and nullable options. So that I can create options like Taco / Steak / Pasta, and add side options that are relevant only when one of those is selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there's a demand for it to become open-source, why not? But I'll have to improve code quality first. As the presence of french labels indicates it, i18n is not properly implemented for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should add food and prices too. Obviously you don’t need to implement an actual payment system because it’s for fun, but if it kept track of the money, your kid could charge you 0.50 per drink or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slightly disappointed to realize there is not some automated drink machine behind this, as that's more my interest, but cool nonetheless and you handmade drinks are probably better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the subject of whisper being great... A few weeks ago a co-worker commented about the difficulty he'd had editing a work demo, I pointed at various jump-cutting tools that had automated what he did in the past (editing out silences). But I'd also wanted to play with whisper for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So a couple of hours later I'd written a script that does transcription based editing: on the first pass it grabs a timestamped transcript and a plain text transcript for editing; you edit the words into any order you like and a second pass reassembles the video (it's just a couple of hundred lines of python wrapping whisper and ffmpeg). It also speeds up 4x any silences detected that sit within retained sequences in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matching up transcripts turns out to be not that hard; I normalise the text, split it, and then compare to the sequence of normalised words from the timestamped transcript. I find the longest common sequence, keep that, then recurse on the before/after sections (there's a little more detail, but not much). I also sent the transcription to ffmpeg to burn in as captions, because sometimes it makes the audio choppy and the captions make it easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know, tools have been doing this for years now. I just didn't have one to hand, and now I do, and I couldn't have done this without whisper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Couldn't find it on the Play store by searching for the name and the developer's name: if it is not just me then your app is very hard to discover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I am installing it through the link you provided, which directed me to a "install success" page saying "your purchase is successful" even if your app is free. Another obstacle to adoption :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, I was not informed on the page of the app' size. Seeing what it does and the time it takes to download I am afraid it could be huge? Third obstacle :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for the feedback, I really do appreciate you taking the time to check it out and write out the comment! I'll look at adding a note about total app size in the description, it won't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for discoverability / the "your purchase is successful" message, I'm not sure what else I can do, I've set it to free, no ads etc in Google Play. Maybe I need to hit a few more keywords for transcription so it surfaces it more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, searching for "whistle" on play store, I get the app as the third result (ignoring sponsored crap). Searching for "blazingbanana" gets me the app as the first result".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;App info shows 218MB size, which I suppose is about what I'd expect for a model+app code :shrug:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good to know, it's hard to know what real users would see in the play store and not Google just showing you what you want. Thank you for checking it out&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really liked wisprflow on my mac but my daily driver is Manjaro KDE. I have stitched together a bash script that copies the transcription (right now I am using the Parakeet TDT 0.6B) to my clipboard. I would give this a try on linux when it becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just checked out whisprflow, I must say that looks really nice, kudos to those devs. Shame there isn't a Linux / Android version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have added the auto-copy to clipboard functionality that will come with the next Android release and be included in all others. Adding a hotkey / quickbar button is on the roadmap for the desktop versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes absolutely! I'm a GrapheneOS user myself so understand not wanting to have to go through the play store if you can help it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe you have to make the source code public (please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm more than happy to do so, I've used a whole bunch of open source stuff to build the app so it only seems fair, I just need to make it a bit less messy and something I don't mind being public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2019 I created a Google Spreadsheet titled "family debts" that allows my family (4 siblings and my parents) to record when we owe each other money, and periodically settle up. I later learned that I recreated Splitwise, but having something like this with trusted folks has been hugely useful. We have over thousand entries, and use it constantly for splitting gifts, buying something at the store for someone, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Om Friday after Thanksgiving I spent half a day building a telegram bot that accepts an address and a list of Amazon links, and in turn orders the item (at a discount since it uses my Amazon credit card), and adds it to the above "family debts" spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really like the idea of programmable, trusted lending like this, and feel like it could be extended to other groups that you implicitly trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on porting KiCad to the browser. It's a lot of sweat and tears, multithreading issues and some more sweat. I've updated a port of WxWidgets and now I support all the features KiCad needs with ~200 tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I have a build that loads in the browser, but I really want to have "multithreading" which means workers in the web. One can use asyncify with emscripten to translate blocking C++ to WASM, but that transition is not perfect, right now I'm debugging a bug where there's a race condition that halts all execution and the main thread runs in an infinite loop waiting for the workers to stand up. I guess I'll have a few of those ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main goal is to 1. just have fun 2. use yjs as a collab backend so multiple people can edit the same PCB. This will probably work with pcbnew, KiCad's layout editor, since it has a plugin system and AFAIK I can do the sync layer there. For the rest ( schematic, component editor etc. ) I'll have to figure out something.. KiCad does not sync automatically if you modify a file, I'll have to do some lifting there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I really want this thing to exist, I'm hoping that I won't run into a "wellll, this is just not going to work" kind of issue in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just finished a dsn parser and now I am planning to write a pcb router. All in rust. The plan is to have a wasm/wasi version as well so routing is possible in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bedtime Bulb v2 [0], a light bulb that emits less blue light than other lighting, is finally shipping. It took years to get it right, but we figured out how to make a relatively energy efficient bulb that emits infrared and dims smoothly with any dimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My team is also about to ship Atmos [1], a lamp for the bedside that automatically shifts from higher-blue light during the daytime to low blue light at night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very cool, what’s the temperature range/wavelengths? (good idea to specify it on the product page - otherwise it’s unclear how is it different from other lightbulbs)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bulb ranges from 1700K to 2100K (it warm dims)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atmos ranges from 1800K to 5700K&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe not the most obvious, but for both products, it’s in the tech specs under Quality of Light. We try to be very detailed with what we publish there. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a combination of factors: you must reduce both blue light and intensity of light to avoid suppressing melatonin. Just reducing blue light might help a little, but it still suppresses melatonin. Melatonin levels and circadian phase shifts scale with total irradiance even if blue-depleted; basically, dimming the lights is really effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why our products focus on both intensity and color change (but we lead with blue light reduction since it’s easier to grasp).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, if you look at our specs, you’ll see that we don’t use pure amber or red light; we use very low-blue white light with high color rendering. We have yet to do the study on this, but you can read surprisingly well with our lighting at a very low intensity (enough to make your mom angry that you are hurting your eyes), whereas with lower CRI sources, you would have to make them brighter to achieve the same visual acuity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is some emerging research that IR may play a role in melatonin production locally in cells, which is why we added it to the bulb. Early days for this scientifically, but Scott Zimmerman and associated researchers suggest wideband IR may be effective, even if it’s only 20-30% of the visible intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started out as something marginally more useful than vendoring your dependencies as submodules + baking in the knowledge of how to build a bunch of common projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realized, though, that there was somehow a huge gap in the insane world of C build tools. There's nothing that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Lets you pin really precisely and builds everything from source (i.e. no binary repository)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Does not depend on either a scripting language or a completely insane DSL (Conan uses Python, CMake is an eldritch horror, ditto Make, lots of other tools of course but none of them quite hit the mark)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Has a good balance of "builds are data" and "builds are code".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's going great. There are, of course, a ton of problems to solve. Chief among them is the obvious caveat that C is not a monoculture like Rust. There will be zero upstream libraries that use this tool natively. But I don't think it matters. I think I can build something which is as much better to the existing tools as, say, UV was to existing Python tools, even with that disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love programming in rust. Lots of non-rust developers think the whole point of rust is safety, but honestly, the things I like most about using it are the quality of life features like cargo. I love the idea of bringing that to C!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relevant to this thread: I've spent the last week or so hand porting SeL4 from C to Rust, mostly so I can learn how it works (and learn OS development more generally). One of the biggest pain points I've had trying to use SeL4 is understanding the insanely complex way it uses cmake to compile the kernel and userland software. With Cargo, I can just run `cargo build` on my rust kernel project and it just works[1]. I don't even have a build.rs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'd love it if we had a tool that made sel4 so easy to build. I doubt it'll be that simple, but its a lovely goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] (Well, except for one small step: You need to run objcopy to convert the 64 bit elf into a 32 bit elf to run it in qemu. But other than that!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds interesting and challenging. There's something similar, although not the build part just the modular aspect of it inspired by CPAN called CCAN: https://ccodearchive.net/. Very few people know about it, I believe, and it goes way back. I'm not involved with that project, though. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Me too! It's pretty good. Unfortunately, it depend on Python. Not that Python's that bad. It's just that it's completely bonkers to me that building C, the most fundamental language that's commonly written today, the language that every other language has an FFI for and three quarters of them either are written in or were bootstrapped with a version written in -- that this language depends on PYTHON to build!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's crazy, and I understand why it's the case, but I know how to fix it and I'd like to have a crack at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volatility regime models (Markov-switching GARCH, regime-switching stochastic volatility) are ubiquitous in finance. However, they share a fundamental limitation: regimes are identified ex post from return dynamics, providing no predictive power for regime transitions. The standard approach fits a Hidden Markov Model to returns, labels high and low volatility states, and estimates state transition probabilities that are essentially unconditional averages. This matters because the economic value of volatility timing depends entirely on predicting regime changes before they occur. A model that identifies regimes only after observing the returns is useless for trading volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing research documents regime-dependent behavior but does not identify causal drivers of regime transitions. The papers on volatility forecasting factors, variance risk premium dynamics, and market instability from option flows dance around this question without directly addressing it. The recent work on causal ML in finance (double machine learning, causal forests) has focused primarily on equity return prediction rather than volatility states. The connection between options market variables and subsequent volatility regime transitions has not been rigorously established through causal methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We develop a causal framework for volatility regime prediction using option-implied variables as potential causes of regime transitions. The key insight is that options markets are forward-looking, so information embedded in the implied volatility surface, put-call ratios, option order flow, and term structure slopes may causally influence future realized volatility regimes rather than merely correlate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently about 2,000 people play every day and I’ve released 59 puzzles!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One feature I’m excited about is crowdsourcing puzzles. Today’s puzzle is a “community puzzle” made entirely from clues that players submitted! I plan to do this every week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote about launching and the first month of puzzles if you want to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started playing a couple weeks ago (and got my Mum and one of her friends playing too).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I enjoy it, but I find the clues seem a bit too easy, and honestly I'm normally terrible at crosswords. Take that for what you will, totally understandable if you're aiming at "cozy/relaxing".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate the polish of the UI compared to a lot of the other janky word games out there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And thanks for the feedback! Balancing the puzzles is really tricky so it’s good to know when folks think it’s too easy or too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to see the range of player skill (and how much they do or don’t enjoy challenge.) On a recent puzzle one player left feedback that it was too easy and another left feedback that it was too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My aim is for puzzles to be challenging but not frustrating. The hard part is frustrating means different things to different people. From my stats I can see some players complete a puzzle in 2 minutes that takes another player 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the daily puzzle I do lean towards making it a little easier but I want to explore a few ideas for making trickier puzzles in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Releasing additional “bonus” puzzles this are harder or more complex - Letting people build and share their own puzzles at whatever difficulty they choose - Adding settings to allow players to toggle things like hiding the theme at first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I’m still trying to figure out the overall balance for the daily puzzles! It’s good to know you think they’re a little on the easy side. I should try to gather more feedback and maybe tweak that!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been playing by just looking at the title of the puzzle and ignoring the clues. I can solve most of the puzzles that way, and it increases the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My sister and I are glued to it, and she continues to destroy me, with consistent zero reveals and half the time to complete, as yours truly. We love this game. thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed it was added to a couple of others that I didn't submit to (goldles.com and dles.aukspot.com) I'm not sure if there are others I should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not totally sure! Marketing is not my strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think my biggest advantages are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- It’s sticky. A good percentage of players keep playing once they start&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Organic sharing. Lots of people have told me they shared it with friends and family. (I also built a “share” feature)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern so far has been:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I share it or someone else shares it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- There’s a big spike of people trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I get some new players.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- The player count stays roughly steady until it gets shared somewhere else that gains traction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was featured by Thinky Games. Sharing here got people interested. Someone shared it on Metafilter and that got a lot of views. Other folks have shared it on other sites that have led to smaller bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the games were either developed with libGDX or threejs. I have no plan to monetize yet and still work on building traffic and improving SEO. Surprisingly, I got approved for google adsense already, which I submitted just for experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building an open-source project to reduce GitHub Actions CI costs by running jobs on self-hosted runners on owned hardware. The motivation is to fill the gap between local workflow execution by projects like https://github.com/nektos/act and self-hosted runner setups on the cloud. My team’s requirements are simple and we don’t require all the features. We hope to keep ops simple and save costs. Any efficiency boost due to caching will be A bonus&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a postcard maker for museum collection artworks in the creative commons. It's in a phase where I'm looking to get feedback from people who might like to use it. Right now it only sends mail in the US. I've integrated the Met, Cleveland Museum of Art and AIC, with an experimental feature for Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a combination of a shoot-em-up and deck building. You fly and shoot until you get to the boss, when you get your deck out to fight them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That genre combination is definitely too ambitious, but I think it is fun to play and I’m enjoying making it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of ideas how to combine the two parts better. But over the years, I’ve learned to control scope creep and actually ship pet projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I’m in a middle of changing how enemy waves are spawned. After that I want to make a short tutorial and add two more bosses as well as more enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you end up playing it, please share your feedback I’ll be glad to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is made using Kaplay, a game dec library which brings me joy to use. I can best describe it as my friend described Pico-8: “easy things are easy”. But compared to Pico-8, Kaplay doesn’t have virtual console limitations and comes with a big library of components. Try it out, the community is small, but the library itself is really fun and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: For context, this is about two weeks of work, in the evenings when my kid is asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I completely understand what you mean, I often feel like that as well. Like every other skill, it takes time and it feels frightening when you see other people's work. Honestly I don't think I'm that good at pixel art, this is my first pixel art project. To be fair, spaceships and technology are pretty straight forward to draw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a TUI tool which demonstrates the behaviour of X86 SIMD instructions. This is all done in Go assembly, and is probably most valuable for Go programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem for me was trying to read and understand the implementation of a swiss map implementation. The SIMD instructions were challenging to understand and the documentation felt difficult to read. I thought that if I had an interactive tool where I could set the inputs to a SIMD instruction and then read the outputs, understanding the instructions would be much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This turned out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building this tool for all AVX/AVX2 instructions turned out to be a larger task than I had expected. Naively I just went off a Wikipedia page on AXV and assumed it had listed all the instructions (this was a bad assumption).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am nearly there. Looking forward to completing this project so I can actually use it to do some fun stuff processing text and maybe even get back to that swiss map implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a session prep tool for tabletop RPG game masters. The idea is to make a narrative engine rather than another static wiki. Most existing tools are great for storing lore, but they don't help you run the story. I wanted something that supports the "create now, refine later" workflow — get ideas into structure fast, then refine as you play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core features: - interconnected world-building (NPCs, factions, locations) and story-building (situations, fronts, clocks) - Bidirectional linking — connecting a story hook to an NPC makes that hook visible from the NPC's view - Clock system with milestone consequences that can spawn or edit entities - Situations fire different consequences based on outcome (players engaged vs. ignored the hook) - Material waste detection — flags under-connected content so you know what's prepped but unused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main workflow is mindmap-based. Each entity gets its own context layer showing direct relationships. (Soon available in demo version) Working on next: automatic player-facing content. As players complete situations, public notes from involved entities get published — so the GM doesn't have to maintain a separate campaign log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing with a Arduino compatible Uno R3 and a WS2812B RGB addressable LED light strip. I cut a 3m strip into 5 strips that are 28 LEDs long and soldered the lights together to make a display. I’ve been working on coding a font for the lights and can display about 10 different characters currently. It’s my first time really doing any sort of embedded work and my first time actually successfully soldering. Now that the thrill is gone since I solved this challenge I was thinking of making a remote control snow plow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m self-teaching modern C++ by developing a native music library manager and player for Windows, macOS and other Unix systems. The main focus is on the 100% custom UI (with Direct2D/CoreGraphics/Cairo backends), aiming for responsiveness, power-user friendliness and compactness. The UI thread is absolutely sacred and I’m trying really hard to separate the core logic from the UI, because I hate how laggy and hang-prone all players I’ve tried are. I’m drawing inspiration from pre-2010 skeuomorphic and dense UIs. Key features include fast incremental imports and powerful UI elements with features like multiple column sorting, multiple element selection and keyboard-first navigation. I understand this problem is already solved, but I’m starting to DJ and curate my personal music library again. So far, nothing has been more satisfying than an old unsupported version of iTunes that doesn’t even support FLAC. I’ve tried foobar2000 but it doesn’t meet many of my requirements. Therefore, I’m building this software both because I have a need and because writing it is very fun (and frustrating at times)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written a PoC already (mind the crappy and incomplete UI), mostly to test the wild custom UI idea, and it’s working so far! https://i.redd.it/ocx9m5av6d6g1.jpeg&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplicity and density of that UI is nostalgic. You say it's crappy and incomplete, but all I'd want is a search bar which can actually scroll the whole-library view to the found-song (something I wish Spotify did, but they only filter.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay fine, playlists are a good thing to have as well. Either way, I miss stuff this simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A portable, robust desk cloud chamber with a 10x10cm viewing plate. It's taking ages and having just one AIO cooler wasn't the smartest choice, but nothing else would've fit. It's a way harder project than I expected, at least if you want everything to be vibration-resistant for car transportation and for it to last years. I've learned a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started a challenge I call “Dopamine Detox December” in which I stopped doing certain things to stop dopamine stimulants: - No social Media - No news - No video streaming services (such as YT, Netflix, and Amazon Prime) - No electronic and energetic music&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on The Password App (https://thepassword.app) - an AI-powered macOS desktop app that automatically rotates your passwords across websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem: most people have 100+ accounts with weak/reused passwords. Changing them manually is tedious, so nobody does it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution: import a CSV from your existing password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden), select which accounts to update, and the app uses browser automation with Gemini 2.5 Flash to navigate to each site's password change page and update them in parallel. Exports a CSV with the new passwords to import back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key technical choices: - browser-use library for AI-driven browser automation (handles dynamic sites better than Selenium) - Local-only architecture: passwords never leave your machine, no cloud sync, everything stays in memory and is cleared after use - Electron + Python: React frontend with a Python agent for browser automation via stdio IPC - OpenRouter for LLM access (Gemini for navigation, Grok for validation)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security was the most important and the hardest constraint. Passwords can't be logged, can't be sent to the LLM context, and can't persist on disk. Custom fork of browser-use to inject credentials via secure parameters invisible to the AI agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently at v0.38 with code signing and notarization for macOS. Working on improving success rates - the main challenges are 2FA requirements and anti-bot detection (Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love feedback from anyone in the security/password management space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It lets you open links in a side panel, so you can quickly look at a page without leaving what you’re reading. I built it because I tend to open too many tabs when reading docs or search results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports a few simple triggers. My favorite one is long-click: you click and hold a link, and the preview opens in the side panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome recently added Split View that you open from the context menu. It works, but for quick checks it feels a bit heavy. You have to right-click, move the mouse, and pick an option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With long-click there’s no menu. For me it feels faster, more intentional, and better when scanning lots of links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the work lately is about polishing these interactions and dealing with browser edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a free USCIS form-filling tool (no Adobe required)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;USCIS forms still use XFA PDFs, which don’t let you edit in most browsers. Even with Adobe, fields break, and getting the signature is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I converted the PDF form into modern, browser-friendly web forms - and kept every field 1:1 with the original. You fill the form, submit it, and get the official USCIS PDF filled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on OpsOrch(https://www.opsorch.com/), an open-source orchestration layer that provides a single API across incidents, logs, metrics, tickets, messaging, and service metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sits on top of existing tools like PagerDuty, Jira, Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and Slack, and normalizes them into a shared schema. It doesn’t store operational data, it just brokers requests through pluggable adapters and returns unified structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motivation came from incident response workflows that still require hopping across multiple vendor UIs and APIs with different auth models and query languages. Instead of another “single pane of glass,” this is meant to be a small, transparent glue layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of the core service, I’m also exposing everything via an MCP server so LLM agents can query incidents, metrics, and logs as typed tools without needing vendor-specific knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently open source, written mostly in Go and TypeScript. Still early, but usable with PagerDuty, Jira, Prometheus, Elasticsearch, Slack, and mock providers. Feedback from SREs and infra folks has been very helpful so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently improving this order queueing and sales recording web app for small coffee shops. Made primarily for my friend's coffee shop. Data is stored locally, and the app is fully functional when offline. There is an optional "syncing" feature to sync data with multiple devices which requires a sign up. This is a Progressive Web App built with Web Components. The syncing is made possible with PouchDB/CouchDB. Completely free to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently making a number of "breadboard-able" analog computing modules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always loved electronics since I was a kid (still trying to learn). As I explore and learn I've begun to make these small "breadboard helpers" [1]. (Just one on Resistor Transistor Logic (RTL) right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An obsession over a project in a 1970's hobbyist electronics magazine sent me down the rabbit hole that is (was) analog computing. So I have been bread-boarding and prototyping small analog computer modules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm in the PCB-layout stage for the modules and hope to have them ready early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started a newsletter [1] focused on agentic coding updates, nothing else. Other newsletters/blogs cover a lot of generic AI news, industry gossip, and marketing fluff. Having a focused feed is something I wanted for myself and finally I have enough time that I can write this newsletter regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been spending weekends thinking about authorization for AI agents, specifically delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The failure mode I keep hitting: once you give an agent tools, it gets ambient authority over all of them. There's no clean way to say "for this task, read-only on the reports table" or "spin up no more than 3 VMs." When the agent spawns sub-agents mid-execution, they inherit full access by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IAM doesn't help much. Authority stays tied to the agent's identity even as intent shifts during execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm exploring a capability-based model instead: authority is explicit, task-scoped, and attenuating. Closest to Macaroons/Biscuit, but adapted for workflows where delegation happens dynamically mid-task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Watermark'd. We want to give businesses a verified digital identity that works across the globe starting with businesses registered in South Asia (DUNS number that works for the 21st century).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we do is quite simple 1. Verify the business is registered in the claimed jurisdiction. 2. Verify if individuals have the authority to act on behalf of that business. 3. Provide sharable credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm thinking about creating a brilliant.org clone (the old version, not the current enshittified one) but entirely community-driven and open source: Besides the classical features (create/delete,edit your own problems) you can also have courses and collections: courses are a ordered sequence of lessons and problems, lessons are post-like entities that can contain text, images, animations, embedded videos through links, latex, code, ... Collections are just a ordered sequence of problems (ideally it is a progressively difficult path of problems, but this feature can be used for anything you want). It would also feature a wiki, and eventually a forum for discussing/administering the website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to join the project, contact me replying at this comment/writing at gbc0 [at] proton [dot] me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video intelligence platform for coaching programs and training companies. The problem: these businesses sit on 200-500+ hours of video content that becomes a "content graveyard" - students can't find what they need, coaches burn out answering the same questions, churn stays high.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do deep transcript + metadata extraction, then layer RAG search and an AI assistant that can answer questions with timestamped citations back to the exact video moment. Think "ChatGPT for your video library" but with accurate sources instead of hallucinations. Tech: Phoenix/Elixir backend, Next.js portals, two-tier RAG architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently serving a few coaching programs in high-touch sales mode. Would love feedback from anyone who's built RAG systems over media content - curious how others handle the signal extraction problem (transcripts are noisy, you need to identify what's actually being taught vs filler).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building pyreqwest, a high-performance Python HTTP client backed by Rust’s reqwest. It has gotten quite feature rich: async and sync APIs, similar ergonomic interface of reqwest, full type hints, and built-in testing/mocking. It has no unsafe code, and no Python-side dependencies. (Started after getting too annoyed with all the issues httpx has.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've recently updated an internal tool which basically acts as a configuration and dependency/context manager for performing hundreds of api calls. I added an httpx backend (to test vs the current urllib3 backend) and also introduced an async API (httpx as well). However, from your benchmarks it seems like I should've went with aiohttp for faster async? I will work on integrating pyreqwest as well&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes httpx is badly broken. Eg its connection pooling implementation is not great at all. There are various issues in httpx/httpcore. There are also old open PRs trying to fix issues but maintainer(s) are just not intrested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just launched a restricted browser for kids for iOS: https://weblock.online Now testing on my kids. The idea is that the browser is whitelist-only, so kids can open only approved websites. I receive a notification when they want to visit an unknown website and I can allow or deny it. Works great for my family, hope it will be useful for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-platform game framework for/in the Odin programming language. It's also the foundation for my first Steam release. The plan is to get something out on Steam, roll with the punches (bugs,) then open it up for general-use. I say "framework" instead of "engine" because the scope of the project is to make the decisions the beginners get stuck on and free them to make a game. That's a smaller goal than what you see with Unity, Godot and Unreal, but I am already at the point that I'd rather use my thing than Godot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making a first aid kit for stingray stings! If there are lifeguards nearby they’ll usually treat you, but we think it would be nice to have a “go bag” in the back of your car for scenarios where there aren’t lifeguards (remote beaches, or after sunset, etc). The standard of care is to clean the wound and submerge it in water around 110-120F for 1-2 hours. We’ve been researching the best, safest method to get that heat, and working on putting a package together. Here’s our first attempt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually doubt that. Irwin was a philanthropist and a scientist, with a decent sense of humor. This is a basically profitless project for public good. I think if the founder has bona-fides, Irwin’s estate would jump at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmmm we've never approached the Irwin estate, even though all our work is about stingray sting prevention and treatment. We do need to make profit to stay in business, so it's not entirely charity. Maybe we should see how they feel though. I also worry about the optics of advertising so directly on somebody's death. Especially because none of our products would have prevented / helped in his scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a LLM fiction writing workflow and associated tools. It's built on agentic coding tools with lots of structure, guidance, prompting, and critique. Almost all of the flow is on the filesystem and using a custom command-line tool, making it accessible to agentic programming tools. (No MCP though; it seems superfluous?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was fairly neutral about the tool for a while, but lately I've been going all-in on Claude Code, using things like rules and subagents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also built to "rerender" the story, for instance rewriting it (slightly) for voice, translate it, or target different reading levels or background. I'm interested in translating stories for language learners in addition to simply translating into other native languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also hoping to create some stories that stretch the medium. Perhaps CYOA (though I'm struggling with understanding what a CYOA is good at), though also other multi-perspective stories with reader autonomy in how to read through the story. LLMs make it easier to overproduce content, so you can give the reader flexibility without feeling regret that much of the content will be skipped, or rewrite passages for readers who jump into stories part way through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Producing quality content is hard, and frankly kind of expensive, which is why I'm focused on finished products instead of interactive experiences. Though I do look forward to some future opportunity to take these rich characters that are grounded in full stories and find other things to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for the feedback and your suggestion! A (partial) correlation network with Cytoscape.js is planned as one of my next experiments. A former colleague nudged me in that direction just a few days ago, and now you as well, so I'll probably have to build that next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to build a small-scale ISP/hosting provider domiciled in Canada. We really want to be able to rent real rack space to enthusiasts who would like to benefit from having stuff in the datacenter but don't want to take on the opportunity cost to get started. It came out of my own desire to have a machine in a DC rack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week we've been writing a bunch of "reviews" of self-hostable software since a lot of our friends are curious about this space but don't have a good understanding of how to get started. https://blog.colocataires.dev.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your VMs are a bit pricier than some other larger services located in other parts of the world - which I understand. I hope you are able to scale to the point where you can lower these prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any legal or other reasons I, a resident of Canada, should host my services in Canada rather than in Europe or US?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want to put local history on a map, so when I go somewhere I could ideally just open this webapp and immediately get presented with cool or interesting history that happened close by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently spending time establishing relationships with historical societies, as I really need them to contribute points of interest, and stories. Many of these societies are run on a voluntary basis by 70+ year olds, so it's a long process. Getting some good responses eventually though, so it might actually go somewhere, just a lot slower than I want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also still doing https://wheretodrink.beer, but haven't added anything of note since playing on this other project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, thanks for the interest, but I'm not that far along yet. I have a bare bones alpha, but it's not ready for the internet just yet. I also haven't secured the domain names so I won't be sharing any code names :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so very silly, but the only way I have to collect emails for people interested in the progress, beta testing or final version, is on my beer page.. So I created a page for the world's most obscure / smallest city and if you want to be updated you can register there - https://wheretodrink.beer/in/croatia/hum-75gkn - The registration is under "Stay informed about updates in Hum?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone signs up I'll manually move you out of that list and into the "local history" waitlist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplification of my digital self. Removed most of my online accounts. Removed all my VPS's. Removed most apps from my phone except core ones. Cancelled a lot of online subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the real world finally moved everything to USB-C. Gave all my old cables away. I have two chargers in my home and a handful of C to C cables. Everything connects to everything now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Home is now downgraded to a dumb home. Lights work on physical toggles. No hubs or sensors anywhere. Heat and AC is with a dumb panel on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a similar thing a few years back, but rather than simplifying, I focused on getting rid of hacky DIY things that needed maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got rid of almost all the customized software in my life, and the few projects I decided to keep, I aggressively modernized, getting rid of thousands of lines of original code and adding many times more tests than I'd ever had before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It very significantly improved my life and career to not have a second part time job maintaining a note taking app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, it’s always having website productivity blockers on all my browsers across all my various devices (and for the most part, not installing news apps on any devices either). Haven’t simplified my digital life, but at least it’s very restricted. Yeah, if even one device doesn’t have one installed, feel like am vulnerable to having hours sucked away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And actually, still browse the web and watch YouTube, but just on my non-work days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a lot of micro-USB and some Lightning. CAT5E and lower. HDMI 1.4 and lower. All still useable cables for many people. It went to my local hackerspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a lot of hobby projects. Some home automation. Some would scrape websites for archival purposes. Maybe a seedbox and an arr-stack. Total monthly cost of a bit over €60 for all of them. Didn't really add anything to my life and the upkeep took about an hour every month, even with auto-updating as much as possible, sometimes things broke or required manual updating (+migration).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of them were open to the public, I SSH-tunnel into them. All stuff just for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I backed everything up locally and shut them down. They should be auto-removed at the next billing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a simple service that allows one to post live activities to mobile devices (iOS to begin with).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as something I wanted to build for myself. I have a Bosch dishwasher that lacks any glanceable indication of how far along it is. Bosch provides an app, but checking the progress takes too long to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured live activities was a good fit, and then realized that I am not alone in wanting something like this. So, I am trying to make it into something usable for all the home automation tinkerers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Love this, I'll keep an eye on it. I'd happily use it with my apartment building's clothes washers, which are connected to the internet via a painful UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon used to have a thing for books that didn't have Kindle editions, "Click here to tell the publisher you'd like to read this on Kindle." You should develop in public (X/Bluesky/Mastodon), and have a prominent form for wonks like us to forward "I want Aivi" to various manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making a totally unnecessary and overly elaborate magic item system for my game https://www.chesscraft.ca based on Diablo 2 items. Is it the most reasonable next thing to do to expand the business and monthly revenue? Hah, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But unlike my day job, this is my project and I get to do what I want. This is my code therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://fooqux.com/ - an experimental article aggregator about software development. For several years now, I've had a routine of collecting articles on topics that interest me throughout the week and then reading them over the weekend. To help organize and streamline this process, I created this website. The main idea is to gather tech articles in one place and process them with a LLM — categorize them, generate summaries, and try experimental features like annotations, questions, etc. I hope this service might be useful to others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a mission to build the best interviewer platform with emotional intelligence, to make the conversation comfortable and engaging for the user. Not just a chatbot, but a deep real-time knowledge capture framework with conversational AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first consumer product is Argo https://getargoai.com, but we're working on a B2B version as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We dug deep into what makes a conversation not just a nice chat but a deep, profound, top-notch interview, when the interviewer who neither pries nor forgets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes people come to Joe Rogan or Lex Fridman and talk for 4 hours straight without feeling interrogated or experiencing conversation fatigue?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if we had an app on our phone that helped us capture a story, filling the gap between two photos?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the questions we're excited about. Would love to hear what everyone thinks about conversational AI beyond the typical assistant paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent the last week starting to hand port SeL4 to rust. Mostly because I want to learn how kernels &amp;amp; capabilities work. This seems like a fun way to get my hands dirty with operating systems without needing to invent everything from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, there's no benefit to using rust over C for SeL4. SeL4 is formally verified - which provides a level of assurance far beyond what the rust compiler can check at compile time. I'm really just doing it for fun and learning. I've been wanting to really understand sel4 for awhile, and there's something wonderful about learning it from the ground level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, I've got a stub booting. The CPU successfully boots into 64 bit mode and starts running my rust code. I'm starting with x86_64 because thats whats on my desk. At the moment I'm porting the code which locates the root process via multiboot, so I can set everything up in memory correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have just released a map of median rents in Berlin [0]. Now I'm improving it. I want people to enter their search criteria, and get an idea of how rare and expensive their desired apartment would be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will help people set clear expectations for their apartment search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a couple new toys for birthday/xmas: the GPD MicroPC 2 UMPC and the M5Stack Cardputer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MicroPC is great because it makes it super easy to code and hack on something in places where it would be too awkward or annoying to whip out my laptop, and the Cardputer is just a fun little toy because it's so open ended and hackable. I've been writing an app for Cardputer to control my thermostat remotely, and I've had a lot of fun grossly overengineering the needless amount of concurrency I have added through FreeRTOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something oddly satisfying about using a micro PC to program an "even more micro" PC. What a cool time to be alive; I would have killed for this kind of stuff as a teenager!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stuff like the MicroPC excites me. Even though, logically, you hardly need need a micro pc but the hacky excitement of using it is worth it. I have also been looking at purchasing the MNT research pocket laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got frustrated on how difficult it is to compare many elections using alternative voting methods against each other, so ended up extending a friends project, adding more results, details and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just added datasette lite to the approval voting site. it’s pretty cool to query the SQLite db in the browser. https://approval.vote/data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A platform that takes your podcast footage and produces the podcast(with trailer), mid form clips and reels by analyzing what your audience responds to posts it on various social media[0].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fiat to crypto payment gateway for businesses and freelancers without a strict KYC. Users can pay using card and merchants can claim instant crypto settlement[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WIP: a casino algorithm that outperforms most casino algorithms in terms of user retention over a long period of time with the objective function of maximizing long term profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's essentially a book progress tracker. There are many apps that allow you to add the books which you are reading currently, but not at what pace. It's simple, no complicated stuff, no AI shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Created as I was overwhelmed by the number of books I want to read and thought it would be helpful to plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You add a book name, number of pages and how many pages you want to read in a day. It calculates and gives you the number of days and on which date you will finish. It's also flexible to increase the number of pages so that it can recalculate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a PWA for now. Still working on notifications and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several years ago I wrote an internal tool named Fogbeam Universal Competitive Inteligence Tool (eg FUCIT). It was up and running and doing it's job for a while, then a lot of stuff happened and it kinda fell into disrepair. It's a Grails app and the original Grails version was something like 2.2.3 and I think it was running on Java 1.6 or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, for a lot of reasons that don't matter now, the time has come to rebuilt | reinvent | reinvigorate this thing. So for the last week, I've just been working on updating dependencies, fixing the resultant breakages, and also fixing miscellaneous bugs that had never been fixed (or possibly even noticed) before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of today I have most of the base functionality up and working again. I just got all the Quartz scheduling stuff set back up and now I'm testing the scheduled job that fetches data from RSS feeds and creates associated records based on the contents of those items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Up next: test|fix some functionality around defining "semantic assertions" about entities in the system (using Apache Jena) and then I'll at least be back where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, I have some UI improvements to make (the UI now is basic GSP pages with Bootstrap and jQuery), and then some GenAI integration stuff. Beyond that: who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did pick up Volume 1 of "The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence" earlier this afternoon and read about 25 pages. I've also been working my way through "Parallel Distributed Processing - Volume 2" and "Principles of Semantic Networks" for the past few weeks, so continuing to grind on both of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://finbodhi.com — It helps you track, understand, and plan your personal finances — with a double-entry accounting. You own your financial data. It’s local-first, syncs across devices, and everything’s encrypted in transit. Supports multiple-accounts (track as a family or even as an advisor), multi-currency, a custom sheet/calculator to operate on your accounts (calculate taxes etc) and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, we will have benchmarking capability. You would be able to compare your networth growth with inflation, compare your investment returns with benchmark etc. We would support both nav and value based benchmark. The topic is interesting in itself, and somehow, not emphasized/available in most tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asset price fetching and benchmarking works best for Indian markets. We would like to build better support for international assets and benchmarks, but haven't figured how to get the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: you can try demo without signup, but it doesn't work in Firefox Incognito mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on my language learning app (Python, tkinter) "Xiaolong Dictionary"[0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is supposed to implement all kinds of features, that I usually miss in vocabulary learning applications, such as a very powerful search function, and the ability to add arbitrary tags, a table of words, and learning progress statistics (not yet implemented).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has minimalistic dependencies. Currently the only non-development dependency it has is jsonschema.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep the configuration of the application in a JSON file. This configuration already allows to configure many things, like for example the various learn levels, and what their meaning in terms of the spaced repetition system is, which attributes of a word will be revealed in what order, when practicing, what attributes to show in the columns of the vocabulary table, and what font to use for the big character display widget (useful for languages like Chinese).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's AGPL, so feel free to fork, but adhere to the license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since hacker news last saw it, it’s been translated into English, German, Spanish and Chinese. If, say, a Chinese speaker wanted to learn more English words, then they could go to https://threeemojis.com/zh-CN/play/hex/en-US/today and play the game with English words with Chinese definitions and interface. This is the first cross language daily word game of its kind (as far as I know), so it’s been a lot of fun watching who plays which languages from where.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next challenge that I’m thinking about is growing the game. The write ups and mentions on blogs add up, the social sharing helps, but I’d really like to break into the short form video realm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you read interviews from other word game creators, every successful game has some variation of got popular riding the wordle wave, or one random guy made a random TikTok one time that went super viral, and otherwise every other growth method they have tried since then hasn’t worked that well and they are coasting along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, sans another wordle wave, I am working on growing a TikTok following and then working on converting that following into players, a bit of a two step there, but that’s how the game is played these days. https://www.tiktok.com/@three_emojis_hq for the curious. Still experimenting and finding video styles and formats that travel well there. Pingo AI and other language apps have shown how strong TikTok can be for growth, so I think there’s something there. That’s all for this month!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on Mukbang 3D for the past year and a half—an iOS app that converts food videos into interactive 3D models using photogrammetry. Record a short video of food, and viewers can rotate/zoom/explore it while the video plays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently added pose tracking of the 3d model so I can overlay 3d effects onto the underlying video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a utility to help DJs find "play-out" versions of tracks they already like[1]. You can play with it here[2]. Streaming services are optimized for Radio Edits. But to actually mix a track, I usually need the Extended Mix, Club Edit, or a specific Remix. Manually searching for the "DJ version" of every single track in a 50-song playlist is tedious administrative work that kills the joy of digging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remixify automates the search while leaving the selection to you. You paste a Spotify playlist URL, and it helps you or provides you a good starting point for digging. It groups the results by the original track so you can quickly preview and save the versions you want to a new playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't try to recommend new music or use AI to guess your taste. It just finds the usable versions of the music you already selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an affordable SaaS platform for small and mid-sized fabrication shops across the US and Canada. It automates quoting and production for sheet-metal and CNC jobs and can handle pretty much any CAD format, even full assemblies. On the AI side, we've got a mix of models doing the heavy lifting: a tuned geometric transformer for feature detection, a graph neural net for topology, and a vision model for mesh segmentation. All that ties into our custom CAD logic for geometry parsing, 2D nesting for laser/machining, and 3D nesting for forming and packaging. The whole idea is to level the playing field so smaller local shops can compete with the big instant-quote guys without needing an in-house dev team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't tell how you allow the small shops to make instant-quotes. Is it because they can instantly visualize the part? Or do you process the customer's design and provide the shop additional information that helps them do this? Or are you just generating the final quote itself already based on what you know about the shop and the customer design?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good question! Right now we’re starting with the sheet metal side of things: laser cutting, forming, welding, surface finishing, and final touches like anodizing, powder coat, or just a clean mill finish. The platform takes the customer’s CAD file, runs DFM checks, figures out material usage, laser time, bend complexity, and weld length, then instantly generates a production-ready quote based on each shop’s own pricing and capabilities. This quote includes delivery cost + an estimated time you can expect the part. There’s 2D and 3D visualization built in, but the real magic is the drag-and-drop, get-an-instant-quote experience. The reality is, most fab shops are still painfully slow when it comes to quoting. Even in 2025 it’s not unusual to wait a week (or three) just to hear back. That’s the gap we’re closing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, we aren’t using any CAD software for this since we’re not trying to be in the design space ourselves. Instead, we’re using libraries like OpenCascade’s Mesh Toolkit to read and tessellate CAD files into a hybrid 3D format optimized for web rendering, while preserving precise geometry, topology, and manufacturing data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a platform for innovators, founders, developers to validate their idea against real users (not AI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My purpose to build this platform is two-pronged–first to solve the "Power Law", in simple terms, where platforms such as Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, etc. only put forward the popular content (most upvoted, liked, viewed, trending, etc.) and people who are posting regularly are still left behind fighting for some interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, to provide a platform for people, innovators such as myself, who keep asking the question "is this worth working on? worth spending time and money on". There are subreddits with hundreds of thousands of followers and Redditors and many of them are still not getting the visibility they need to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember that I had a lot of ideas throughout high school but I wasn't able to get real answers and validation from people so I dropped it. So specially for those people who need a little bit more visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m trying to build 1 decent iOS mobile app per month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most recently released one was My Vocab Quest[1], a vocab mastery app with lots of word packs. It uses some gamification mechanics to make sure the user puts in the reps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current apps in the hopper are centered around:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(1) Recovery from cosmetic surgery. There are several balls to juggle for days, weeks, and months after a surgery. The app helps the user follow surgeon instructions, promoting physical and mental recovery, as well as medical and dietary changes. Makes use of phone features including contacts, calendar events, notifications. I’m learning to build an App Clip for it and hope to partner with some surgeons to get it promoted in their offices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(2) Assisting older Americans to be more independent for a little longer (a parent of mine has early stage dementia). Helping the user maintain a regular schedule, take their medications on time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(3) A dating ideas / meal ideas and agreement app. It helps increase creativity for date ideas, learns from how predictable you are, and facilitates agreement between the users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 90-min workshop to introduce development Teams the full potential of AI coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few months I’ve been optimizing an AI-first SDLC for real engineering (not vibe code), getting amazing results on small Teams both in terms of delivery output and devex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some friends asked me to formally present and help their Teams, and enjoyed every moment of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core simulator part works, but I don't yet have a user interface or documentation. Probably just going to be text input files to start, maybe a GUI later. Recently, I'm mostly working on testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simulator is object-oriented and basically allows one to build up a blaster from separate control volumes and connections between control volumes. This is useful as it allows the same core simulator framework to handle different blaster configurations and even variants of them. For example, someone asked me to make the spring piston able to pull a vacuum on its back side due to not having sufficient flow. That's easy here as I just need to add another control volume and the appropriate connection onto the basic springer configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a low cost email service. Ditched Gmail for my custom domains to avoid lock-in risks, and I believe devs really need stupid-cheap ($10/yr 5GB, unlimited mailboxes/domains/aliases/SMTP/IMAP/webmail) high-quality hosting that nails deliverability with zero spam tolerance. Bootstrapped this instead of pricier options like FastMail. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your interest. IMAPsync migrations are supported. No CardDAV/CalDAV. For wildcards, do you mean catch all? If so, that is supported as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first vibe coding platform to create personal apps that run entirely on chat starting in WhatsApp. We already have some beta customers building and it is really exciting to see what they are using it for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-wine inventory tracker (lets you rate the wines that you drink and own) -outfit planner (has an inventory of all your clothes) -expenses tracker for trips w friends -personal training coach (keeps track of all the muscle groups that you have used with the purpose of eliminating muscle compensations)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are quickly releasing beta access for people in the waitlist! Would love to have more people using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open sourcing a system where you might have notes in markdown to build a knowledge base, and review them according to a schedule, but also Anki like flash cards attached to each note.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All notes are simple markdown file stored locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using it to benefit my research and make the knowledge to stick better on my head for several years. My base is more than 400 markdown notes now, and I sync them to a private GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on an award flight search tool -- theres so many interesting problems to solve: - How do you bypass bot detection? - How do you achieve fast loading results? - How are you able to teach users how to get the best deals possible w/ award travel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Theres so much more to do in terms of reliability (bypassing bot detection) and onboarding new programs (right now, only American, jetBlue, Delta, Virgin Atlantic and Alaska are supported). But progress has been good and im excited about it. https://awardlocker.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CtrlAssist – an open source project to bring more accessible, collaborative gaming to Linux! Inspired by PC gaming sessions with my own family, where both young and old relish exploring rich stories with immersive worlds (like Witcher 3, RDR3, Hogwarts Legacy, etc) but find coordinated combat or movement control too challenging to play solo, CtrlAssist lets you combine multiple controllers into one virtual gamepad, much like assist features on dedicated game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether your helping grandparents through tough boss fights, or co-oping with nieces and nephews to level age gaps, CtrlAssist aims to make PC gaming on Linux fun and accessible for everyone. While I’m certain similar utilities exist, I also just wanted a holiday hobby project to practice Rust development while scratching a personal itch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please give it a try, share your feedback in the relevant discussion categories, or check out the open issues if you’d like to contribute, help is always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Developer Feedback and Rust Community Discussion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wanted to save up a few tokens when passing data to LLMs and did not like anything on the market, so I made minemizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minemizer is a data formatter that produces csv-like output, but supports nested and sparse data, is human readable and super simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It produces even less tokens than csv for flat data, due to most tokenizers better tokenizing full words that contain a space before the word, and leads to less fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many cool things I discovered while running tons of testing and benchmarking, but it's getting late here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Ignore latency timings and token counts in "LLM Accuracy Summary" in benchmarks as different size datasets were used to generate accuacy numbers while I was running tons of experiments. For accurate compression numbers see compression benchmarks results. Or each benchmark one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will eventually fix all the benchmark numbers to be representative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a house renovation project in SketchUp, I wanted the same workflow I use with Claude Code: describe what I need in natural language, let AI write and execute the code, iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a bridge. Python MCP driver talks to a Ruby extension inside SketchUp via JSON-RPC. Claude Code can now write Ruby scripts, execute them directly in SketchUp, take screenshots to verify results, and introspect the model - all without leaving the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still very early (macOS only, requires SketchUp 2026), but it's already useful for repetitive tasks and parametric designs. "Create a spiral staircase with 15 steps at 18cm rise" is more fun than drawing it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My next step is documenting how all of the subsystems work (such as virtual memory, allocators, drivers, etc.), then lay the project to rest. I don't have any grand ambitions for the kernel. The project was just a labor of love, and a way to learn some interesting things! Hopefully some of the documentation can serve as learning material for other people interested in osdev.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing around with the Whisper models for a few years now. Last year I had an idea about how to run Whisper Large v3 in real time. That idea became ScribeAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the quality of transcripts was so high, much higher than I could get with Parakeet, I started to think about how it would serve as a good input for live translation. I played around with this and was surprised by how good the results is, I’ve used it to follow along political speech’s from foreign leaders and other content I’d have just never been able to consume before. You can translate by bringing your own LLM service API key or using the inbuilt Apple Translate models (for a completely offline experience).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was using another paid tool my accountant suggested. Then I decided to build my own tool, but free and open-source. It gets the job done at least for me plus I have some ideas how can I improve it further. For example I built a simple automation where an invoice is generated every month, emailed to me for review, and then I forward it to the client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on something that lets you describe a hardware product in plain English and get actual manufacturable files out — PCB, enclosure, firmware, the lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very early days still. Whilst I created a fork of toon for Kicad (called TOKN (https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn)), with the intention of using a reduced token format to generate schematics using LLM's, I could get the models to follow the syntax correctly, but they didn't have the knowledge. So I was then going to create a whole RAG system, but got distracted by this current project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are people out there doing AI schematic generation, like flux.ai (which is incredible (and incredibly well funded)), but 90% of products, especially at proof of concept stage, are basically a microcontroller, some power, probably usb, and some IO, bluetooth/wifi if you're lucky. So we can use a library of pre-validated subcircuits and slots them together on a grid. Routing's deterministic, so if it compiles, it works. (sorry, deeppcb &amp;amp; Quilter!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enclosure side is more fun: once the PCB's done you've got real dimensions to work with (board size, mounting holes, where the connectors poke out), so I use an image model to generate some concept art, then feed that to an openscad generating model as visual inspiration alongside the hard constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically trying to get a full hardware product pipeline done automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a meditation app where an LLM guides you without the usual back-and-forth chat. You set your preferences up front (style, duration, focus), then it delivers a structured session end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a long list of ideas and features to try, but right now I’m focused on feedback. The app is live on the App Store, and I’d love input on: • What would make you try an AI-guided meditation app (or avoid it)? • What settings matter most to you (duration, tone, technique, background audio, etc.)? • What would make the guidance feel trustworthy and not “chatty” or generic?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re willing to test it, I’m especially interested in first-session impressions and what you’d change to make it something you’d actually keep using.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a medical student, I'm making a site of free tools for medical trainees, the biggest being a rank list tool to balance logical factors and gut ranking as well as pairwise comparisons/maps/etc. https://medcompass.tools/rankcompass. Might adapt to other avenues to help people pick housing and other things that require ordered lists and decision tools!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building https://aero.zip, an E2E encrypted, resumable file transfer tool (think WeTransfer but encrypted and not P2P). I just posted it to Show HN:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Streaming ZIP: To allow downloading multiple files as a single archive without buffering, I implemented a custom streaming ZIP64 archiver. A Service Worker intercepts the request, fetches encrypted chunks, decrypts them, and constructs the ZIP stream on the fly in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* OPAQUE auth: I used the OPAQUE protocol (via serenity-kit) for the password-authenticated key exchange. It ensures the server never learns the password and protects weak passwords against offline attacks if the DB leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Passkey PRF auth: If your passkey provider supports PRF (like iCloud Keychain or Windows Hello), the app derives the data encryption key directly from the passkey, allowing a login flow that doesn't require entering a master password.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From what I understand, croc is P2P, i.e. both computers have to be on for the transfer to happen (the "relay" that they mention only helps negotiate the connection between two peers). With aero.zip, you upload your files to a server, and the recipient can download it whenever - either real-time while you're still uploading them (imitating the P2P/croc model), or at a later date. This is a more universal approach IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, aero.zip is a webapp, i.e. there's nothing to install, and you don't even need to sign up to send small files. Meanwhile, croc is a CLI utility which will be hard to use by mom-and-pop users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a way of working/tools for working with an LLM that allow you to track decision tree graphs, have the robot make more informed decisions and build its own logical chain for history keeping, and modeling all the work as a DAG of events, goals, outcomes, decisions, and observations that network together to allow you to work better/smarter/faster, giving it a living and recorded memory and ways to explore all this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easiest to check out the short demo on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also links to the live graph of how the tool has built itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cool name, with both hints at "decid[e]" and the graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd be interested in integrating this with bug systems of decisions / goals, with actions being comments on those bugs (for work purposes) instead of having a custom deciduous-only DB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this meant to be open source? I don't see a LICENSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://lenzy.ai - helping products built around chat with AI (think Lovable or Cursor) reduce churn and prioritize product improvements by analyzing their user's chats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started about 2 months ago, found 2 early adopters and focusing on making them really happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I am working on an insurgency game mode; where one team has to defend some caches and use guerilla tactics, whilst the other team has a smaller size but the advantage of firepower and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was into playing the mods for the original and played some of 2142 on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has the official multiplayer gameplay held up? I did try a release around the time of RDR2 on Xbox and it had seemed like pay to play may have messed with it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious if the mod support seems like a jailbreak from the official multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on building out a microservice ecosystem on OCI. I'm not formally educated so I just sort of stack things up and tear them down. I hardened my server and I am running dockerized services. I'm also running a web server that hosts the very start of my long-term personal site. It's been pretty challenging, illuminating, and down right fun. I've been putting down the controller for a terminal!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously, I'm very proud of myself for the little I've accomplished so far. I don't have friends in tech so I don't get to talk about it or bounce ideas off people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's based on my simple web app to learn Korean vocabulary. I'm taking elements from Anki and other language learning apps, but making it focused so it works well in a broader language learning journey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are working on DB Pro, a modern desktop data workbench for developers and data engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The focus is on going beyond a query editor and building a complete environment for working with data. Visual exploration, inline editing, dashboards, and Jupyter notebook style workbooks for queries, notes, and experiments all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We launched v1 a few weeks ago and the reaction has been genuinely jaw dropping. Downloads, feedback, feature requests, and some great long form discussions around real world data workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are documenting the entire journey through a public devlog series. The latest video covers the v1 launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is a customizable digital math workbook. Currently the demo covers fourth grade math. There is a practice mode where you can select the skills you to want practice. There is also a customizable dashboard where you can setup your own widgets to practice math skills in different ways. I am working on some pre-made dashboards to help users get started. The next plan is to cover fifth grade math skills. My plan is to cover first grade math up to Calculus and High School Physics. I envision it as a companion tool for Khan Academy/Math Class/Math Books. Check out the demo. No signup required. Progress is only stored locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second thing I am working on is an application to practice Cangjie. It's a Chinese input method that has been around for a long time. It is based on a visual decomposition of characters. Each character is represented by one to five codes and the majority are unique. My application teaches Cangjie like keyboarding (QWERTY) is taught to young students. You learn the location of the keys, then some basic words, then start typing sentences. I also have a free demo for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skyrim mod manager for the Nintendo Switch version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s mainly for personal use because converting, renaming, and packing mods in bulk can be very tedious. Especially if you're always changing your mod list (which is a given).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, once I make it more user-friendly and add a proper GUI, I’ll likely release it to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing work on my AI game development agent for Godot, Ziva[0]. Basically, big games are made in game engines, and game engines are hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now you can use it to chat about and modify basic things in your game; it automatically adds open scripts, scenes, and assets to your context, and uses around 50 MCP tools for editing. Currently working on refactoring the agent loop to use Claude Agent SDK so we can piggyback off the Claude Code developer experience and focus purely on the tool and integration side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published my first AUR package this week. It's called bleep, a simple interval timer that beeps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea came from cooking bolognese. I needed something to remind me when to stir. So I wrote a small Go tool that just beeps at whatever interval(s) you set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I kept adding stuff. Verbose mode with a live countdown, pause/resume with signals, and a JSON output mode that works with Waybar. That last one is actually my favorite part. I get a little timer in my status bar that changes color when it's counting, paused, or beeping. Click to pause. Works great for pomodoro or just keeping track of things while working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I switched from Mac to Arch and wanted to try the whole AUR thing. Used GoReleaser to automate the build and publish. Took some fiddling but it works now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a temperature controlled dough proofing enclosure based on ESP32, an IKEA Samla storage box and an inexpensive silicone rubber heater. It's delightfully impractical-- purely a first hardware/MCU learning project and a holiday gift for a relative who I think will appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm impressed by how far I can get "vibe making". Most of my professional experience is in high-level software, but AI gets me unstuck quickly when I don't know something specific to ESP-IDF or the hardware. As of today I've got a circuit tested, firmware nearly complete, and a custom PCB en route from JLCPCB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One limitation I’ve noticed: ChatGPT struggles with the details of part selection (e.g. choosing specific temp/humidity sensors or connectors). Adding datasheets to the context helps a lot, which makes me wonder why this isn’t something the model can do or at least ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a hardware/software utility to play Switch/Switch 2 games remotely with my brothers. I found a way to emulate a Switch Pro Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico based on several different sources (look in the README for more info). I used that to write a firmware for the Pico (with the help of GPT Codex 5.1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I wrote a Python program that connects whatever controller my brothers want to use (as long as it's supported by SDL2.0) and forwards that data from their computer, through Parsec, through a USB-UART adapter, to the Pico, then to the Switch. I then have a low latency capture card (Magewell Pro Dual HDMI I got off of ebay for $100) forwarding the video and audio from the Switch to my PC which I share to my brothers via Parsec. The audio was a bit tricky to get right, and ended up having to use a Virtual audio cable and Voicemeeter potato (a software audio mixer) so that both myself and my brothers could hear the audio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works surprisingly well and the latency is pretty low. I even got rumble working! (but not motion controls. If anyone wants to attempt it, I will accept PRs). I haven't done any formal benchmarking for performance, but my brothers and I were able to play Smash Ultimate without too much bother about latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also use the accessory Python library I made to automate switch controller presses (look in the examples directory). Might be useful for TAS speedruns?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project is here for anyone interested. It's a bit rough and needs some cleanup and maybe a video tutorial on remote setup. But here is the WIP:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Thursday I learned about ulid[0] which I think really neatly solves the problem of text representation for UUID v7. However, I also like the idea of prefixed ids, although I haven't used them in anger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I built most of a Postgres extension, using the excellent pgrx[1] project, that build on ulid to add prefixes. With it you get something like this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not really working on anything big right now, mostly just improving what I wrote, in particular documentation-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However had, on my todo list ... a few things that are important to me are there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is to create some kind of pseudo-language that can model biological cells, from A to Z. I am having something similar to erlang in mind (to some extent). Now, this is nothing new - modeling is quite old, bioinformatics is old, but I have a few ideas that are somewhat novel IMO (e. g. really following erlang here, just adapted to biological systems).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I have a few smaller ideas. One is to finish a webframework where everything is really an object at all times. Meaning, I can work with objects when describing a webpage, from A to Z. HTML tags are objects too. I don't typically use them directly, though, but more in a meta-layout, e. g. I want to describe a webpage, but on a higher level, and also push that down into a .pdf file then seamlessly. My goal here is to be able to work with objects everywhere, not just for a single webpage but for all local and remote webpages, a bit similar to Alan Kay's old ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a couple more ideas (one is the widgets project where I want to describe a GUI only once and then have it work in as many variants and languages as possible), but realistically I also focus on the smaller things to do as they are much easier to solve. Right now it is more important to me to finish as much as possible before the end of the year, so prioritising on smaller things makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a product designer with no training in development. I've been hacking together a ridership data analysis platform for public transit planners using Claude Code. The data is all fake generated right now for King County Metro routes, but it pulls real GTFS for the route / stop information. AI coding is making things possible that I never dreamed of until recently - glad to be learning these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL extension providing big speedups on COUNT/SUM/DISTINCT and GROUP BY for the most common data types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm looking for people who have pain around slow analytics, avoiding migration from PostgreSQL, delaying pg upgrades or other big reasons to adopt something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a no-code multiplayer game editor. The idea is to let anyone create multiplayer games in a few clicks without writing code—and share them instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The platform handles all what's necessary (and annoying to setup) out of the box: multiplayer, controls, mobile/responsive/ inventories, save/load, leaderboards, quests, dialogue, etc... Users just select what they want and configure it with clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, the engine just reads a config file and renders it for players. I've built all the foundation blocks that interpret the config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll soon be onboarding game designers to stress-test the editor/engine. Still polishing templates so people have a good starting point, but it's functional and I'd love feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent a considerable amount of my free time over the last few years working on an open-source game engine for making Zelda-like games (link in profile). It's been around for a few decades, and I played it when I was a kid - and now I'm contributing heavily to it. To give a since of scale, there's ~1000 custom fangames made in this: so pretty niche, but if your thing is Zelda it's got some real gems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my time has been spent practically rewriting the engine from just single-screen play areas (like Zelda 1) to be free-scrolling (like Zelda 3). I've also put lots of work into supporting all platforms (was just Windows; now it's also Mac/Linux/Web). And I've delved into tons of interesting programming projects while working on this: a deterministic record + replay testing system; a garbage collector for our custom scripting language; JIT compilers for x64 + WASM; a VS Code language server; the list goes on...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyhow, this month I'm trying to polish it up as much as I can so we can officially release the next major version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyperclay: a way to package up HTML files as portable, editable apps that contain their own editable UI. I'm using these simple apps to plan, edit emails, write blog posts, and a lot more. I edit them on my mac and they sync to the web live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like being able to design my own document format on the fly and display it however I want. It's making it painfully obvious how many editable primitives the web is missing, however.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Porting/reimplementing a Tcl interpreter from C to Zig, based on the design of Jimtcl. This is one of those sub-projects that started due to another project (folk.computer in this case). The biggest difference is thread-safe value sharing, and (soon to be) lexical variable capture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why? Right now folk.computer has about a 20% overhead of serializing and deserializing values as they get sent between threads, and it's also meant we can't sent large amounts of data around. I previously attempted to make the Jimtcl interpreter thread-safe, but it ended up being slower than the status quo. So, I started hacking on a new interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commands evaluate, basic object operations are in place, but there's still a ton of work to do in order to implement core commands. It may even be good enough to swap in some day!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building Hypertrophy, an iOS-native workout app. I've always wanted a simpler, cleaner experience than Strong (on which I've done over 1000 workouts) so I built my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've tried to make it look and feel at home in iOS and I like to think of it as a Notes app for the gym—it does very few things and does them well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's completely free with no ads because I'm not a fan of how other workout apps charge you for a basic workout experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've just finished up the Import from Strong feature and would love any feedback on it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a beginner-friendly online programming language for teenagers who want to learn to code. I think there is not a clear enough winner for what teenagers should do after they learn Scratch so I am trying to make it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw this shared recently. The site presents nicely, and I agree there's a gap there. As a university professor, the story of my students' learning has pretty much been; Scratch, some Python, and then they pick up whatever early-college curriculum is. There's a strong preference for scripting languages like Python and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you say "what teenagers should do after learning Scratch," what do you mean exactly? Should do to what end? How would Easel present as "the clear thing" they should do? I suppose Scratch wasn't really chosen by these young people; it is obviously simple, and has the prestige of MIT. Schools followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're in a different situation, where you have to meet this market in the open. When I visit your site, I am met with code. It's not apparently simple, and a beginner wouldn't be able to distinguish it from any other games programming framework. I think it's actually scarier-seeming to a beginner than something like Godot's scene editor, where you can just drag images from your disk into a prototype-view of your game-scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope my plainness in stating this isn't taken as an insult. You've got so much work there, and the site is impressive. I also care about this topic, age-range and the learning process, so I'm trying to be helpful with my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've started fund raising efforts for a project related to accelerating adoption of authenticated encryption between mail servers (it's time to move past opportunistic TLS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also launched a web browser extension last week, Blog Quest, which has some great early adoption numbers that exceeded my expectations. When I can find some spare time I'll start fixing up some of the early feedback/feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also working on getting Nix setup on my devices, including a PR for the official installer to support OpenRC + BusyBox distros. Hopefully will get merged soon :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://localhero.ai, automated on-brand i18n translations that run in your CI pipeline. Right now I'm working on better .po/gettext support, based on feedback from an early customer. With gettext you usually keeps source strings in the actual source code. So I'm building a workflow where non-technical people (PMs, designers) can edit translations in the web UI and then easily generate a PR with both code changes and translation file updates. Trying to make translations work smooth for both automated CI pipelines and PMs/designers who don't live in Git, when translations are checked into the repo. Also going through my network, talking to devs and localization folks to understand what could be improved in their orgs for translations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;its a web app where you make boxes, add images or text of what's in the box. then get a qr code that you can tape to the box and scan to see the text or images in the web app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;hoping to make it a lot easier to look for things in the storage unit. instead of removing all the totes and looking in them. Just scan and see if the description fits what I'm looking for&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been slowly progressing on writing a Rust like language that compiles to JavaScript for a few years now. With the rise of AI and it becoming better recently with Opus 4.5, specially with Rust, I've been trying to have a speedrun version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it as TypeScript but with full algebraic types and other commodities from Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building Contextify - a MacOS application that consumes Claude Code and Codex transcripts, stores them in a local sql db.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main window uses Apple’s local LLM to summarize your conversation in realtime, with some swoopty UI like QUEUED state on Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve just added macOS Sequoia support and a really cool CLI with Claude Code skill allowing seamless integration of information from your conversational history into aI’s responses to questions about your development history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CLI interface contract was designed to mutual agreement between Claude code and codex with the goal of satisfying their preferences for RAG.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new query feature and pre-Tahoe support should be out this week, but you can download the app now on the App Store or as a DMG.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m very excited about this App and I would love to get any feedback from people here on HN!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s an interesting direction. I haven’t thought of this in multiplayer sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would you see this as something that is sort of turn-key, where a central database is hosted and secured to your group?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or would you require something more DIY like a local network storage device?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And similarly would you be open to having the summaries generated by a frontier model? Or would you again need it to be something that you hosted locally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A central service. Hosted, secure, frontier model is fine. I’m thinking this through it’s probably something GitHub or an addon should provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But maybe it starts local with an app like yours anyway. I do a lot of solo hacking I don’t want to share with the team too. Then there is some sort of way to push up subsets of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can see github providing this, but it would still be at the git-operation level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've found using this contextify-query cli in talking to my project(s) CLI AI history is substantial detail and context that represents the journey of a feature (or lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In high velocity agentic coding, git practices seem to almost be cast aside by many. The reason I say that is Claude Code's esc-esc has a file reversion behavior that doesn't presume "responsible" use of git at all!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I find interesting is that neither Anthropic nor OpenAI have seized on this, it is somewhat meta to the mainline interpreting requests correctly. That said, insights into what you've done and why can save a ton of unnecessary implementation cycles (and wasted tokens ta-boot).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on the above?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're open to giving the app a try, and enable updates on the DMG, the query service + CC skill should drop here in a few days. It's pretty dope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyhow, this is really cool feedback and I appreciate the exchange you provided here. Thank you. If you have any further thoughts you want to share I'll keep an eye on this thread or can be reached at rob@contextify.sh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a web application to catalog your guitars and amps and pedals and record each time you service them and when you bought or sold them. It’s a free service and I’m looking for BETA users to try it out. I switched up the tech stack and went with Rails with minimal AI assistance to go back to feeling like I did back in uni when I was building applications for fun and had to figure things out by trial and error. It’s been nice switching gears and doing things my way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a Telegram bot for video/image translation, and also Firefox/Chrome addons to help translate web content with smart content extraction and non-breaking layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Firefox addon/Chrome extension is free, but you need your own OpenRouter/Gemini API key. The cost of web translation is really low, you can translate an article for ~$0.01 with really good quality. (You can try at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/subly-xyz/)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built it because I use Firefox the most and it seemed like no translate addon was good or simple enough. Chrome translate kinda works, but the quality is so low; it usually doesn't understand the article context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what my company does (https://espresso.ai/), I'm taking advantage of the end of year quiet time to hack on some more R&amp;amp;D-style projects we have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Civil 3D plugin (Genabler) that will include all the network catalogs and collate the Civil 3D styles for civil engineers to use. There are some out-of-the-box catalogs and styles shipped with the default installation, but they are quite limited and fairly well hidden—which is not surprising, given that Civil 3D is a huge beast. As a result, they are not commonly used. When people think about Civil 3D, they often assume it requires BIM modelers (in a sense, just glorified drafters) to create all the necessary catalogs and styles, and to assist with their use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Civil 3D plugin will:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Make standard, market-compliant catalogs and polished styles available to engineers at large. Think of it as the WordPress theme provider equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Make the entire process easy and painless through the plugin, with prominent buttons for quick access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the plugin is done well, there will be less need for BIM modelers, since for a fee, engineers could simply purchase catalogs and styles that are so easy to use they require no technical training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side benefit, I also get to explore how LLMs can help me write code. It has been a while since I last updated my AI usage policy [0], and I look forward to revisiting it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week I'm taking a break from my next project in this series (celery related) to try to participate in game jam related to programming language creation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Vibe coding a microcontroller firmware project. I'm using "vibe coding" in jest here because I'm actually an experienced coder, but this was a chance to try using the AI coding assistants for a clean sheet project at minimal risk. I'm going on 63, and could easily finish my career without AI, but where's the fun in that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One amusing thing I've noticed is that every time the AI generates code with a hard coded hexadecimal constant, it's a hallucination. My son suggested feeding all of the chip datasheets into the AI and see if the constants improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Finally converting my home semi-hobby electronics business (something like a guitar effects pedal) to machine assembled circuit boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built https://nofone.io . I ingest health insurance policies and provide insights to insurers on how to improve them and doctors to know what insurers expect to see in documentation and evidence. My hope is to improve the denial situation and standardize medical necessity criteria down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a tool in golang to handle requesting access to private and sensitive databases in Postgres. The goal is to help orgs reduce handing out long-lived postgres creds with broad permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flow is you declare the databases and tables you want to access and the specific permissions you want, an operator reviews it, if accepted it generates a temporary postgres user with those permissions you need. Also, all the connections to the database are proxied through the app, so the domain name and port are random and short-lived, so you don't expose internal database hosts. As an extra, all SQL statements during the user sessions are logged if you want to see that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just put something similar together but then on top of Openbao which generates temporary credentials/roles for Postgres. I created a website where people can request access and a specific group of people can approve the approve. After being approved, the database users can request temporary credentials in OpenBao for a specific number of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building a free poker training web app, specifically aimed my friend JG who wants to place sufficiently high enough in a WSOP or WPT satellite tournament to qualify for the main tournaments: https://holdempuzzles.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to make my Rust library `composable-indexes` more ergonomic. It is for indexing a collection on multiple dimensions in a type-safe and composable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, something safer &amp;amp; more concise than maintaining multiple HashMap's, but a lot less involved &amp;amp; simpler than an in-memory SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i made a clone of beads in rust that uses CRDTs for real time sync to coordinate a bunch of coding agents at the same time! if running locally, it's instant, for git it takes around .6s after your last action. lives entirely in git, and is like... an actual distributed database/issue system, just works, and u never gotta think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a TypeScript to native code compiler, via the Dotnet CLR toolchain and Native AOT. This lets you use the excellent Dotnet std library - which in addition to being faster is also much safer than the npm ecosystem. There's also a node compat library, which exposes Node APIs but with CLR underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result will be a binary (linux and mac for now) which you can run without NodeJS. Simple programs already work, and I have web apps very nearly running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://canine.sh, an open source, self hosted PaaS for Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big part of this was inspired by the last startup I worked at. In an effort to not deal with complexities of Kubernetes, we ended up on Heroku and was charged exorbitant amounts of money. One year spending close to 400k on Heroku alone, for what should’ve been 10-15k in cloud costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a big part of this is just making Kubernetes more friendly and easier to use for a small / midsized team of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to make it easy enough for even a single developer to feel comfortable with, while also being powerful enough to be able to support a small team&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see that your app/tool is linked on Portainer's website. What's the business model behind it ? I do not see any pricing and I could be really interested as I'm looking for a solution to abstract away k8s complexity for a medium sized company I'm working for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah it’s totally free to use and there are pricing tiers for support that portainer provides. Canine is 100% FOSS. No hidden features behind some payment plan or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portainer sponsors us, to keep us working full time on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shoot me a note at chris @ canine&amp;lt;dot&amp;gt;sh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love to help in any way I can! Always looking for more adoption, esp at medium sized companies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Mizu, a small Go web framework built around a simple idea: net/http is already good, frameworks should not fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've kept running into the same problems in popular Go frameworks: hidden context mutation, magic middleware ordering, reflection-heavy binding, and APIs that slowly drift away from the standard library. The Gin ecosystem in particular has accumulated a lot of technical debt and footguns, which this post summarizes well: https://eblog.fly.dev/ginbad.html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mizu is deliberately boring by design:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Built directly on Go 1.22 http.ServeMux - Explicit middleware chains with clear scoping - No reflection, no codegen, no global state - A real request context type that still interoperates with net/http - First class graceful shutdown and error handling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're happy with net/http but want slightly better ergonomics and structure without losing control, that's the gap Mizu tries to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on the Mint programming language (https://mint-lang.com/) with a 1.0 release in January :). I'm happy with the current feature set, so I'm just polishing and optimizing where I can and giving the documentation a throughout look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have a link to share just yet, but I'm working on an LLM coding agent that can modify its own context and is given hints on when and why that would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expect it to make it possible to not think about when to reset back to a clean session. I also expect it to be more efficient as it will clear out all the "garbage context" that only serves to "confuse" the LLM, cost more tokens, make responses slower, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I get a working prototype, then I will test the feature by using it while reimplementing it in other open source agents to get a feel for whether it has the effects I'm expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to recreate https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/ but in Zig, will probably have to face shit metric ton of hate after finishing it due to probably some mistakes and sharing them online in form of a guide, but I'm doing it to learn myself, hope that project will improve by people posting issues or simply forking the project when I will finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fringe physics: Trying to understand WTF the A field is in electrodynamics, and how I can measure it for a price I can afford. Specifically, I want to communicate through a wall of rock or sea water at VHF frequencies, with high bandwidth. I just upgraded my subscription with ChatGPT to try to grok all of the physics involved. It decided that since this could be used to covertly exfiltrate data, it wasn't something that could be discussed. ;(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently a friend acquired a Collins KW-1 transmitter, serial number 1. I helped him get it working again after a long period of disuse by it's previous owner. You wouldn't believe how often it turns out that wires and bolts don't actually conduct electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe I can help with one or two conceptual things. In classic E&amp;amp;M a field describes the potential (or force, if you prefer) a test charge would experience at that point. Note that the general case is impossible to visualize, as you're associating 6 numbers (3 for E 3 for B) with every point in space, so we normally think of simple setups and slice them up. Accelerated charges make waves in the field which are WAY more complex than people think. The way you model matter is dependent on the frequency of light. For visible light you normally think of it (especially metal) as a crystalline lattice of some characteristic length, electrons that can jump discrete energy levels, with molecules forming some sort of dipole that has more degrees-of-freedom (wobbling, twisting). I don't know about VHF, but the wavelengths are huge, like kms, and therefore way too low energy to cause electron shell jumps, so you'll probably model matter according to some very general characteristic like permittivity and conductivity. For seawater (which is a good conductor) subs use ELF, which is 100s of kms in air and can only communicate at bits/s. It's a fascinating topic, and very niche. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electrodynamics is taught to literally millions of people in Physics or engineering degrees across the world. It is the furtherest from fringe as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would recommend following along the MIT OCW course or similar, doing the exercises. Use AI to help you follow the course and ask questions about things not clear to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on promptfoo, an open-source (MIT) CLI and framework for eval-ing and red-teaming LLM apps. Think of it like pytest but for prompts - you define test cases, run evals against any model (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, whatever), and catch regressions before they hit prod.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently building out support for multi-agent evals, better tracing, voice, and static code analysis for AI security use cases. So many fun sub-problems in this space - LLM testing is deceptively hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you end up checking it out and pick up an issue, I'll happily send swag. We're also hiring if you want to work on this stuff full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a platform for people in my rare fruit meetup group exchange scions. I've never built a react native app, but with the help of Claude it seems possible to build for the web and iOS/Android apps with minimal experience. Hoping to make it really useful for our group before sharing it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a website (https://hpyhn.xyz) for hacker news users for reasons: 1. hn comments are valuable, I've spent a lot of time going through hn comments. I think there are valuable comments buried in the threads with fewer points, so it's not enough to just read top3 threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Sometimes a good post is ignored due to a bad title, sometimes I still have no idea what the post's theme even after I read a few paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. I want to filter out some posts I'm not interested in, but I realized I need read some other posts it's not a simple yes/no problem, so I gave every post a interesting score based on my own preference&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so I built this tool to save my time while not missing out too much on hn&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine direct p2p payments that can be performed without reception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got thinking about what the equivalent of digital cash would be in 2021 and have worked on it on-and-off ever since. It has an optional NFC component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically what I have is good enough to ship, but I’ve been unsure of the legal footing of such a project so it’s been on ice for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimplementing something I originally did in python in rust. Both vibecoded - want to get a better sense of how they compare and whether there is upside to be had from rust typing and „if it compiles it’s probably ok“&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus far - uses way more tokens and noticing reduced steerability. The linting &amp;amp; fix loop seems much smoother though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a TLS proxy/TLS terminator that can handle 3000 TLS handshakes per second (basically an stunnel replacement, but stunnel crashes at under 100 handshakes per second) as a pet project, but I’ve realized that with some polishing this can be really useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is still in development (todo are privilege dropping, in place config reloads, log burst suppression, multiple listen sockets (which paired with the Linux kernel gives free load balancing capabilities), and detailed TLS configurability), but it already matches both nginx and HAProxy’s speed (entirely bottlenecked by OpenSSL crypto by this point) at a tiny fraction of the attack surface and memory footprint (10-15kb per worker process last time I checked).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to take a look, please roast my code :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Python ORM, inspired by Drizzle and the like. Whenever I come to Python I'm frustrated by the ORM options. They generally lack type-safety on inputs and outputs, or useful type hints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLAlchemy is an institution but I think it's hard to use if it's not your full-time job. I check the docs for every query. I want something simple for the 80-99% of cases, that lets you drop easily into raw SQL for the remaining %.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm going to keep hacking at it, would love to from anyone who thinks this is worthwhile (or not). Also: - The interface for update queries is clunky. Should I add codegen? - Should I try to implement a SQL diffing engine (for migrations). Or just vendor sqldef/similar...?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started working on an application to make it easy to see what parcels in NYC are upzoned with the City of Yes[1] changes that were passed last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started off trying to make it a service to help people who are interested in ADU's get connected with architects/ contractors but spent a lot of time working on the interactive map to explore related ideas. The site is here buildbound.xyz and map here buildbound.xyz/map. Right now for example, it's very hard to tell if your site qualifies for the TOD upzoning portion of the City of Yes so maybe there is room to crunch those kind of numbers and provide it as a public service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to decide to keep going down the ADU route in NYC, even though the market is really early here, expand to NY State/ California where the ADU market is a bit further along or keep doubling down on making the best interactive zoning/ land use map in NYC and see if there is any product market fit to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An algorithmic trading hedge fund. We can outperform the benchmark while keeping fees bare minimum because all our admin is outsourced to LLMs and agents. What a world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like I'm working on a million things (between work, side contracts, and creative explorations). Recently a friend asked whether AI is helping or hurting my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I realized I couldn't give a concrete answer. Lots of speculation, but I realized I didn't have hardly any real data. Inspired by Adam Grant's work on "rethinking", I'm _currently_ writing a tiny CLI to run self-experiments on my own productivity, auto-checking in / observing commits/code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goal at the end is to be able to test myself across different dimensions with "no AI", "moderate AI" (e.g. searching, inline assist), and "full AI" (agents, etc). https://github.com/wellwright-labs/pulse&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today is the start of Langjam Gamejam, a 7-day hackathon to build a programming language and then make a game using it. I'm ideating on what I'll build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upload a CSV or circle neighborhoods on Google Maps to build your address list (consumers or businesses). Printing and postage included in one price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 30 days I've added an API plus integrations for Pipedrive, Zoho, and Follow Up Boss. If anyone wants to help test these new integrations, I'll set you up on a special plan and let you send mail at my cost (roughly the price of a stamp).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could create a browser extension that normal users could install such would warn them of a phishing site or email from that domain. It would be 0 cost since you already have the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vive Coding an AI App that searches the net for different types of financial assets and uses the data found to Predict the Future of Financial Markets, i.e. price projections. Just for fun, though the results are very accurate :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not ready for prime-time yet, so not open-source at the moment. I've managed to have it search over 9 asset types, including Crypto, stocks (e.g. different categories), but it is slow going as I am using a free-teer AI. It's found some stuff on the net that is barely in the pre-sale phase, and it predicts 10,000% gain but don't know if it is an accurate prediction or a massive hallucination. Also, I know this has the potential to be a money maker, but I don't have neither the experience nor the financial resources to host this online or make this a viable money-maker at the moment, unfortunately :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a means to learn about both WebAssembly and Rust, I started writing a WebAssembly binary decoder (i.e. a parser for `.wasm` files) from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently it hit v2.0 spec conformance. 3.0 is next on the roadmap. (I'm executing it against the upstream spec test suite.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't plan to make it a highly-performant decoder for use in production environments, but rather one that can be used for educational purposes, easy to read and/or debugging issues with modules. That's why I decided not to offer a streaming API, and why I'll be focusing on things like good errors, good code docs etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd say jump straight to the specification (maybe v2, which is simpler).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I occasionally saw one or two articles around where they explain how the binary format works, which could be a good introduction before jumping to the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like I’m the only one here not already a greybeard, so just gonna share in case it resonates with anyone not already building awesome things: I’m working on learning how to program with C++. New at this, loving it, hoping to make a career change into IT in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m speed-running a bunch of new hobbies to teach myself how to make a physical game (basically its a ping pong paddle that tracks how often you hit a ball — like a “keepy uppy” game with scorekeeping):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Arduino dev and circuitry&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- 3D printing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- PCB design&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Woodworking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its all a lot of fun and IMO a lot more approachable than it has been thanks to the assist from LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My website is statically generated. The biggest problem I faced was adding comments to my blog, that didn't involve loading a ton of JS or third-party services, or add and maintain backend software (say php).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you think your dynamic content could be comments?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've really enjoyed writing blog posts recently. Not only is it a great way to flex your writing muscles, but writing about a topic, unsurprisingly, helps you understand that topic better too. I've had great conversations with friends about the posts I've written as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And sort of in that same vein, I've been developing my own static site generator that I eventually want to move my blog to. It's almost certainly going to be a worse SSG than every alternative, but it'll be mine and that's worth something in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus it's just been fun to make! I wrote some gnarly code to generate infinitely nestable layouts that I'm kind of proud of. It's the kind of code that's really cool but you can only code on a project for yourself, because if someone else had to debug it, they might say some pretty unkind things about you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with you about writing. Back in 2020, I made a commitment to study a CS or math topic in detail each week and then write an essay about it. Those were some of my best learning experiences and when I look back at those essays, they are pure gold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mw-injector[0], it's a WIP project. It detects what Java, Node, Python or Golang services are running on a host and instruments it with Opentelemetry APM. Inspired by Otel-injector[1] but it automatically selects service names for each service so you have service level segregation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a collection of mnemonic images for learning written Chinese. Each has a solarpunk-style image referencing both the character's meaning and pictographic etymology, with the character overlaid and color-coded to indicate the tonality in Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I'm talking about it, do the folks here have any suggestions where I should make it available? I want it to be a free educational resource for whoever might want it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week I vibe coded an golem-forge (https://github.com/zby/golem-forge) - exploration of prompting as programming. Since then I found https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono and https://github.com/johnlindquist/mdflow and I think I'll rather use these existing tools to explore my idea. But I think it might be still interesting project because it is entirely vibe-coded - I don't even know Typescript (I know some Javascript from before React - but none of the new stuff). I did not look into the Typescript code at all - only at what the LLM presented to me when editing it and the docs. At some point I discovered that when I tried to have a core logic and two UI packages the LLM put only types in the core package - so I had drive a hard refactoring - but it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't yet tried this very extensively - but another profound change in programming that this showed me is that it is now very easy to borrow parts of Open Source libraries. It used to be that you could only base your work on a library - borrowing parts of projects that were not designed to be shared (used as libraries) was prohibitive - but with llms it is entirely possible to say: "now please borrow the UI ideas from project X" and it does that. Maybe you need to add some planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working towards a handheld computer with a physical keyboard. Lots of examples out there (Hackberry Pi, Beepy, etc) but wanted to try my hand at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along the way I found most of these use salvaged BlackBerry keyboards which are only going to become harder to find, so also on a bit of a side quest to build a thumb-sized keyboard from scratch. Got me into laying out and prototyping my first PCBs and learning about how these things are made - lots of fun so far!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something cool I learned from tearing apart a BB keyboard: the satisfying “click” is just a tiny metal dome that pops and completes the circuit when pressed. Not news to anyone familiar with electronics manufacturing, but it was a cool thing to “discover.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an open source swift app that sends anything you circle in a pdf or epub to AI for an explanation. Currently it works with Gemini but I'm going to allow users to add their own OpenAI compatible endpoint soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it works best on Mac and iPad. Available on TestFlight and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest project is still Materia[0], a tool for deploying applications with Podman Quadlets. This month I presented it to the Podman User Group's community meeting, which was pretty exciting since I've never presented in a community setting like that before. Otherwise I've been trying to focus on bugfixes, minor feature additions, and working with user feedback so it's not just me fixing my own problems :) . The latter is really fun since I've already run into someone using it in a way that's very different than how I'd imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not coding related, I've been on what I've been calling "The Grand Project" for a bit over a year now where I listen to every single album I own (around 855 albums/singles/eps/etc. As of this moment I'm at 828) at least once. It's been a real trip essentially going through my whole life musically and I'm hoping to write a blog post somewhere about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://wireplug.org: A simple, free, and open source connectivity coordinator for WireGuard. Basically a way to keep WireGuard tunnels connected while moving between different access points. It handles (basic) NAT traversal and works with the in-kernel WireGuard driver on Linux and OpenBSD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I released https://npmdigest.com, a micro-SaaS to work around the frustrating experience of getting spammed by npm emails "Successfully published X" whenever I release new versions of my packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eidetica - a decentralized database built in Rust, intended for local-first apps. It's still unstable but I'm progressing relatively rapidly. In the past ~month I have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m finishing up a language identification model that runs on cpu, 70k texts/s single thread, 13mb model artifact and 148 supported languages (though only ~100 have good accuracy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a model trained as static embeddings from the gemma 3 token embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm experimenting to see if frontier LLMs can do practical CAD modeling. I'm starting with a single task: designing a wall mount for my bike pump in OpenSCAD or CadQuery (two code-based CAD systems).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the frontier LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) produce usable designs when just prompted with some photos of the pump and a written description of the mount. I'm now building a simulator in Mujoco that the LLMs can use to test and iterate on their designs to see if they can do better in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to make an interesting blog post of it and maybe end up with a usable wall mount design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last 3 years, I have been working on a web tool to help me at work: debugging ASN1-encoded data (keys, certificates, Kerberos/CredSSP/SPNEGO/etc data structures, and more) and performing various cryptographic operations. This app is available online; you can try it [0] (no sign-in/up needed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This December, I reached a huge milestone: I implemented ASN1 tree editing [1]. Now I can edit the ASN1 tree directly in the browser (read my blog post for more details: [2]).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm happy that I wrote this tool. I use it often to help me debug my protocol implementations and/or debugging. I know that some of my friends use the JWT debugger and ASN1 parser from this tool. Maybe some of you will find it helpful too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working Solarite, a library for doing minimal DOM updates on web components when the data changes. And other nice features like nested styles and passing constructor arguments to sub-components via attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on Chorebound - an RPG-style chore/habit app. You do real-world chores, they become quests, you fight monsters, get loot drops, earn XP/gold, and level up. Can be solo or co-op with friends/family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve used Habitica and bounced off, this is meant to be more lightweight, simplified, and focused on closer-knit co-op rather than public guilds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building an app that scans file systems prior to being migrated into M365. Looks for common governance issues and file and folder trees that won’t play nice in SharePoint. Not a migration tool as such, just something to scratch a consultancy itch. Python and Tkinter for now until I hit something that requires more complexity. Also a command line version that I’ll use more often. This probably could have been a PowerShell script but this is more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been a long time Windows user (20+ years) who heavily uses WSL 2 as my dev environment with tmux / Neovim but I'm switching to native Linux before the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried once 7 years ago but ran into major audio issues that were a deal breaker but I'm hoping the Linux kernel has improved. I have the same hardware as before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My dotfiles have been public for many years and can 1 shot a new or existing system in a few minutes with a bunch of command line tools on Debian, Ubuntu, Arch (with or without WSL 2) and macOS. It has an install script and theme switching for a long time which I've used to set up a a few systems (personal desktop, laptop and work laptop).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been casually tweaking a laptop running Arch with niri. I'm preparing a bunch of things in my https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles to prepare for that push which will work on Arch Linux and be opt-in to install and configure a GUI and assorted tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a weightlifting logging app for the apple watch. I haven't submitted it yet since I am still beta testing, but I'm mostly feature complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's intended to be anti-memetic, and anti-guilt trip. Just put it on your watch, install a program (open format) and you never need the phone itself. Your workout is a holiday from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data can be exported if you want to use it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I originally made it for ROCKNIX but as there was no way to share the app I paid the Apple tax :/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a modern transactional email API platform. Developers can bring their own AWS SES keys and freely use their own domains for sending emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building it on Cloudflare Workers with advanced tracking, modern templates, and advanced webhook integration. Developers can also configure and schedule advanced workflows for their specific needs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The users can review their usage and performance using an intuitive dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Email is a crowded space and this is my first attempt at doing something indie at this scale. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were many detours and scenic routes taken for what turned out to be a pretty straightforward repair in the end, but that’s not uncommon for these kind of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m on my way back from Home Depot to buy some screws that were missing (and a Xmas tree.) Soon all that’s left will be writing a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make a neural audio codec using a variety of misguided methods. One I am using ESNs wrong spreading leak rates in a logarithmic fashion acting like a digital cochlea. The other is trying to do the same with a complex mass-spring-damper system to simulate the various hairs of the cochlea as well. Both approaches make super interesting visuals and appear to cluster reasonably well, but I am still learning about RVQ and audio loss (involves GANs and spectral loss). I kinda wanna beat SNAC if I can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Building a micro-learning platform that uses AI-powered role plays and conversational assessments to gauge learner understanding instead of eg. a multiple choice questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I’ve just started designs and initial setup for a personal productivity system heavily inspired by the Newton &amp;amp; HyperCard and built in Rust. Idea is to use LLMs to build GraphRAG-like connections between content &amp;amp; break out of the standard app+document model. My current thinking is having ‘frames’ of content (notes, sketches, events etc) that are acted on by capabilities and displayed in views (timeline, calendar, stack, knowledge graph etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Also working on a static site generator and CMS webapp that creates sites that can be viewed on anything, from web browser to TUI. Like if Gemini or Gopher also rendered to html.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m hacking on different side projects but currently I’m working on developing a platform for helping freelancers or small agencies understand aws costs and optimize their environments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its been a pain point for a lot of the clients I work with helping them understand and optimize their aws costs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might get a surprise 1000 dollar bill and won’t be able to understand why it happened or what incurred that costs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've recently been working on developing an MCP on top of Libreoffice Draw and I just learned what an amazing piece of software the whole Libreoffice suite is, I would definitely be trying to use it more and I will take a look at your extension. Thanks for sharing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks inside each file to see what it’s about, then moves it to the right folder for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything happens on your Mac, so nothing leaves your computer. No clouds, no servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works in 50 languages (including English, German, French, Spanish, Swedish) and with images (OCR and object recognition), PDFs, Microsoft Office, ePubs, text, Markdown, and many other file types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have messy folders anywhere on your Mac, Floxtop can help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks very interesting and I appreciate the pricing model and lack of cloud. It wasn’t clear from the site, but is there a check all moves prior to execution function? Undo?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no automatic execution — nothing is moved without your confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Floxtop suggests the top 5 destination folders where a file could best belong. You stay fully in control: you can choose one of the suggestions, move files individually or in bulk (Move All), or select a completely custom folder location at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you change your mind, you can Undo per file or use Undo All to revert the entire operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a meta framework for building "full-stack" libraries. I.e. libraries that bundle frontend hooks, backend routes, and a database schema into a single package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows library authors to do more, like defining webhook handlers and (simple) database operations. The idea is to move complexity from the library user to the author, making (API) integrations easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think libraries being able to write to your database is a pretty powerful concept, and can enable a number of interesting use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know 4 languages. 3 of those I learnt because of my family. I learnt Russian because of work (+fun). I feel that it is always best to go the classic route and learn a language from a manual (currently learning mandarin from a manual) and that gamified experiences of learning languages have a very low learning/effort ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on an MPC stack to make it easier for devs to integrate privacy into their stacks. As normal folks increasingly value the privacy of their data, developers will need to think about how they can build apps while guarding their users' data. We provide tooling for them to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still WIP but we are getting our first audit in the coming days!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on brand new type of collaborative whiteboard that allows anyone (or team) to drag-n-drop items from their devices onto the board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem I'm solving: On a team, people and their files are scattered everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solution: A canvas that attempts to open (and edit) as many file types as possible (images, xlsx, pdf, docx, cad). This means you can have people and files on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the only whiteboard that can natively render docx and pdf so far; these can also be edited directly on the board without having to use dedicated software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has a built-in Drive where you can store/backup files that syncs across your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a few widgets such as Kanban, sticky notes, cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, there's agentic LLM (Gemini 3 Pro) that can take actions such as viewing the board, reading documents on the board, and editing items on the board. For example, you can tell it to read a pdf, then write a spec sheet (in docx), or create tickets on a kanban.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm launching a private beta next month if anyone is interested in testing it out and giving feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on 2zuz, a product search engine that optimizes for the users rather than the advertizers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is simple: if you search for something specific, you shouldn’t have to scroll through ads, “inspired by your search”, or completely-irrelevant junk. You should just only see products that actually match exactly what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now it searches across a few large stores and I’m iterating on the ranking and filtering. If you buy a lot of stuff online, I’d love feedback on where the results feel clearly better, and where they still fail compared to Amazon/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can collide 96-bit truncated sha256 in under 24 hours on a 6700XT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next steps are a) figure out something interesting/useful to do with it (beyond surprising people), and b) modify it to support accepting contributions from untrusted clients (see "Future Ideas" in README). For a sufficiently interesting answer to a) I could create a "SETI@home"-like system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ~102-bit collision would cost $$ worth of rented GPU capacity, and 128-bit is optimistically possible with enough crowd-sourced compute (a ~5-figure dollar cost if you were renting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have been working on three micro-saas, all built in Elixir/Phoenix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://feedbun.com - a browser extension that decodes food labels and recipes on any website for healthy eating, with science-backed research summaries and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://rizz.farm - a lead gen tool for Reddit that focuses on helping instead of selling, to build long-lasting organic traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://persumi.com - a blogging platform that turns articles into audio, and to showcase your different interests or "personas".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I shared this last month, and it seemed to resonate with people, so I'll share again and maybe new eyeballs will see it this time. I'm continuing to build a body of work on my retro productivity software blog, Stone Tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous articles which resonated with HN were on Deluxe Paint and VisiCalc. The latest post, "HyperCard on the Macintosh," seems to be making the HN rounds currently. Bret Victor himself chimed in on the HyperCard article over on Mastodon, filling in some nice historical footnotes. https://posts.dynamic.land/@bret/115716576717006637&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike many (most?) other retrocomputing explorations, I specifically do not look at games nor do I tie myself to any particular machine, though I'm focused on the 1977 - 1995 period. I spend a minimum of two weeks with each productivity title, trying to learn it, building things with it, and generally trying to understand its approach to solving problems. I'd characterize my writing tone as casual, conversational, and decidedly light-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each piece of software (so far, knock on wood) gets me thinking about some other aspect of related computing history, so I explore that as a tangent. With the Superbase article, I talked about "the paperless office." With the VisiCalc article I considered its impact on less obvious industries, notably hog farming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope the passion and effort I put into the articles comes through. If you're interested in computing history beyond just the games I think you'll find something of interest on my blog. "This Week in Retro" did a segment about me and my various projects as well, if you're curious to get an overview of what I'm all about (link is queued up at the start of the segment) https://youtu.be/UHYscl1Ayqg?si=7JM1sZagjoqvPjk2&amp;amp;t=2137&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* The immediate-mode "every tick I ask you for a VDOM based on the user-defined state" TUI framework has all the fundamental features, I think; writing docs and expanding the library of components it ships with. https://github.com/Smaug123/WoofWare.Zoomies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Decided I needed a nice text display widget, so got side-tracked into implementing the Knuth-Plass paragraph layout algorithm; it currently functions but is buggy. https://github.com/Smaug123/WoofWare.KnuthPlass&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Finally starting to put proper effort into the LLM integrations into my workflows, writing skills, defining the Gospel According To Me to try and poke the LLMs into the right basin - with limited success so far. https://github.com/Smaug123/gospel&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started out as a take-home assignment for a job I’m interviewing for (they asked for about 10% of what I ended up implementing but I wanted to do/show more :). It’s an aggregator for crypto exchange data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app reads the public data stream from exchanges, handles the nitty, gritty details of each exchange’s websocket connections, deals with its quirks, cleans up and normalizes the data into a uniform structure (currently only supporting spot trades) then exposes it downstream as an SSE stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uses Go, Templ, and Mithril.js, and is open source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM-driven narrative game. Main technical issue is how go do compaction. I’ve devised a memory hierarchy that compacts the story to a constant amount of tokens per layer. Arc -&amp;gt; Scene -&amp;gt; Moment -&amp;gt; Line. Not sure if that’s the right dimensions to decompose into. Also tinkering how to get the right amount of “divergence” for story progression option generation. A lot of unanswered questions…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on adding features to the snakemake aws batch executor plugin. The existing plugin supports execution on AWS Batch by dynamically creating job definitions based on rule resource configuration, but was missing support for features like using different containers for different rules, consumable resources, secrets, etc. Two approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) https://github.com/radusuciu/snakemake-executor-plugin-aws-b... (my fork). Just add the features to the batch job building code 2) https://github.com/radusuciu/snakemake-executor-plugin-aws-b.... This is more experimental and not yet fully working. I wanted to try a few things. a) can we rely on existing job definitions (managed through IaC instead). b) can we implement a fire-and-forget model where the main snakemake process runs on Batch as well? c) Can we slim down the snakemake container by stripping off unnecessary features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal is to help people get done with email faster, so that they can get back to doing other stuff. A lot of the features are designed around this goal: unified inbox, AI summarization, AI email drafting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of these are table stakes but I think there's also an opportunity to significantly revamp how email is done in the AI age. Imagine having your own personal assistant that goes through your email and surfaces the highest priority things that you need to know automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When someone dies, you don't get even one extra second to access the documents and information they meant to share it with you. Trying to fix this problem with Eternal Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could you go into some detail regarding your approach to security? Presumably, due to the sensitive nature of the documents users will upload, you have a number of safeguards in place?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Files are end to end encrypted with a master key generated by you on your device during onboarding&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- How do your family access the documents when only you have the key and it's E2EE? The idea is the key is splitted via Shamir Secret Sharing when you add a trusted contact, once the doomsday is triggered and they recieve the notification, only then they can use their "shares" to reconstruct the master key and open your vault and access the documents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A open source Node.js lib that allows people to create and version control resumes using YAML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support LaTeX/PDF/Markdown outputs in one shot with professional typesetting. Support English/Chinese/Norwegian/French languages out of the box. With clang style, real time error reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm in crunch mode doing the internationalization and localization of my spreadsheet engine. This is a rabbit hole and a nightmare in Excel, so a big opportunity for us to get this right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glad to see you're doing this! I was wondering if the currency button could be changed. Defaulting to Euro is fine, but being able to switch that shortcut would be handy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm looking at how to introduce unique, borrowed and GC'd reference types into the IR for my VM/runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm inspired by the language Lobster's compiler that specialises functions to arguments of either reference type as a way of doing something analogous to using "escape analysis" to allow objects to be owned by the stack. I think that perhaps specialised functions could be re-merged, with compile-time checks replaced with very cheap runtime checks taking advantage of "upper byte ignore" bits in pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VM will also need to support not just managed source languages, but also languages where unique and borrowed references are statically checked and possibly stored in objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working (mostly vibecoded) a Git history explorer in Go+modernc.org/Tk9.0: https://github.com/thiagokokada/gitk-go. It is heavily inspired in gitk, this is why the name and usage of Tk for the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for it was because after testing multiple Git history explorers, I still think nothing beats the gitk. Sublime Merge is probably the only alternative that I would seriously consider but I don't really like the UI and the fact that it is proprietary (I am not against proprietary software but I prefer an opensource solution when available). Other alternatives have some bugs or the interface few too slow. gitk itself is mostly fine, but sadly it tries to load the whole repository in memory and this is causing issues every time I try to navigate through nixpkgs (I can see the memory consumption going through the roof while the UI slow down to a crawl).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;gitk-go loads a batch of commits (1000 by default) and once you get at the end of the list it loads more. I also add a few features that I miss from gitk, for example if you do any change in the repository (change branches, add files to stash, etc) it will automatically reflect in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, the code is mostly vibecoded since this is the first time I decided to try this from scratch. The code works well for my use cases and it is enough to replace gitk for me, but I can't guarantee there is no bugs and the amount of tests are small. But still, it was fun to see something that I wanted to create for a while (I had this idea for a long time since the issues with gitk that I was having) finally taking form. Probably the program is not useful for anyone but me, but if anything this is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on Klugli - Educational app for German primary school kids (Grades 1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parents set up accounts, kids log in with simple codes and work through curriculum-aligned Math and German exercises. Built with Elixir/Phoenix/Ash and LiveView.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard part isn't the tech - it's creating content that actually maps to the German school curriculum rather than generic "educational" fluff. Currently grinding through grade 2 math topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a little project to make Spotify recommendations better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get to choose the genres you're interested in, and it creates playlists from the music in your library. They get updated every day - think a better version of the Daily Mixes. You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Source ERP system for Makerspaces and Community shared system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started out as a kanban style of system where anyone could request that we re-order cleaning supplies at a Makerspace. Has evolved to tagging assets and maintaining those assets and I'm working on adding ESP32 based device control to enable/disable devices through those QR codes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least in principle, I'm still working on PAPER (https://github.com/zahlman/paper). (Or I should say "resumed"; I was having a rough time of it mentally in the summer through October or so and didn't really get any actual coding done.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has most recently involved a side diversion into a little tree-processing library (where file hierarchies are a special case) — Show HN within the next day or two, fingers crossed — and setting up a fork of https://github.com/pypa/packaging to support EOL Python (back to 3.6) and make some general simplifications (because even this is a fairly large wheel compared to the target project size).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoping I can kick myself back into the blogging habit again soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A side project for my side project: I built my own static site generator with React islands architecture and MDX support, using Bun. (Build your site from .mdx files, output only html+css, progressively hydrate the client with React only as needed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Staring at the errors in my CLI, I realized I did not want to use another framework. It's why I had already discarded the idea of switching to Astro. Twiddling around someone else's abstractions and incentives, frustrations fitting together the final 20% of a project... I've been down that road too many times before. It's never fun. The tradeoffs _you don't know you're making_ are the biggest risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://bid-euchre.com Bid Euchre PWA Play with friends or against robots. Couldn’t find a single deck version online like I used to play growing up. Good resume project. Would love to know your thoughts about the UI!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on a code formatter and parser for Supercollider's sclang. Supercollider is an amazing language, but the development tooling is severely lacking - we need good tooling, and now with LLMs in play and my coding ability leveled up from doing GATech's OMSCS, I'm finally able to tackle this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm learning rust while I'm doing this too, so it's been an experience. Fun, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://greatreads.dev/ A place to aggregate and find articles from developers' blogs. Right now, I'm building a submission form for people to submit new sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a way to search for articles using vectors, it's called "Semantic Search". So basically you can ask, for example, "Postgresql and how to best optimize it." and it would search for articles touching that subject, or at least related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wondering about the best way I can add a weekly newsletter built on top of the content currently being ingested, and still looking for more sources to add to the database (let me know if you have any good recommendations).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very cool! I built something a little similar https://blognerd.app. I'm really interested in the RSS remixing idea, though I didn't quite crack it. I'll be interested to see how you get on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a graph representation of complex data flows through a large organisation. The graph looks like crap, partially because hierarchical dagee graph layout algorithms apply a naive way of removing cycles that ruins the shape of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've figured out a better way to remove cycles that preserves the shape of the graph in a way that works well for our purpose. Now I just need to figure out how to minimise edge crossings and line up nodes in such a way that it's more immediately obvious how the data flows between different systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Bloomberry, an alternative to Builtwith for finding companies that use a specific tech vendor/product/technology. Unlike Builtwith, it focuses a lot more on technologies that can't be detected solely from the front-end (ie devops tools, security products, CRMs, and ERPs)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on Librario, a simple book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources, merges everything intelligently, and then saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of it as a data source, or a knowledgeable companion that can provide comprehensive book information for online booksellers, libraries, book-related startups, bookworms, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a pre-alpha build running for those that want to test it out and the code is out on SourceHut[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been really tough to find time to work on it because I have a baby that only sleeps in my lap, but I’m making progress very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently hired someone to rewrite the entire database layer, as that was written with the help of an LLM for the prototype, which should improve things too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently in the works are a digital sand timer which can be used to track pomodoros (or any sequence of time intervals), and a Jovian orrery which displays the positions of Jupiter’s moons on a strip of addressable LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Inspiree by my wife to pursue my weaponized desire to create things and organize my thoughts, I’m trying to gather my marbles to learn Swift/SwiftUI in order to try building an iOS app that which will automate directing and funneling data to where it needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Updating my personal SSG to support Obsidian fully, which should simplify the publishing process a bit more. https://0xff.nu/hajime/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Trying to find a new job, which is proving to be more difficult than it should be if you have certain standards about work/life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Writing an informative article about automating with/for ADHD which explains the motivation and solutions that I came up with for perhaps the weirdest, yet most annoying issues I face or forget about on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently integrated Lazy Polars and running analytics in background processes so I can reliably provide a fast table viewing experience on dataframes that would normally exhaust memory of the jupyter kernel. Analytics are run column by column and results are written to cache, if a column fits into memory individually, summary stats for the entire dataframe can be computed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a demo video of scrolling through 19M rows, and running background summary stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses LLMs to generate python code to scrap a webpage to fit any Pydantic model provided:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;from hikugen import HikuExtractor from pydantic import BaseModel from typing import List class Article(BaseModel): title: str author: str published_date: str content: str class ArticlePage(BaseModel): articles: List[Article] extractor = HikuExtractor(api_key="your-openrouter-api-key") result = extractor.extract( url="https://example.com/articles", schema=ArticlePage ) for a in result.articles: print(a.title, a.author)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A web app platform written in Rust with the primary focus on zero-dependency apps and using Pingora as a forward and reverse proxy. Targeting Hetzner for hosting and Cloudflare for DNS. I love Rust but don’t like the long compile times which led me down this rabbit hole (zero dependencies make for fast compiles).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Added a fifth project this month. Most likely very unwise...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. probe.bike - tell stories with your bike rides. It allows you to aggregate your cycling trip into one datapoint. Will likely break this out to skiing over the break and rebrand slightly. Adding yearly cards as we speak!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. flopper.io - I'm seeing traffic rise and rise for this and it's been a great way to translate my every-increasing understanding of AI Infrastructure architecture to a new project. It acts as a benchmark website for GPUs and systems (e.g. Nvidia NVL72.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. llmstxt.studio - still feel like llms.txt as an idea make sense - so hedged that and but let's see. Got my first customer this month. B2B and need more features/marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. rides.bike - the oldest - a catalogue or well researched cycling destinations and information about destinations. Will be adding more very soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's 100s of color palette generation tools, where most only let you customize a single color then try to autogenerate tints/shades without much thought about accessibility or tints/shades customization. The main features of this tool are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Emphasis on accessibility. A live UI mockup using your palette warns you if your tints/shades are lacking contrast when used in practice for headings, paragraphs, borders, and buttons, and teaches you the WCAG rules. Fixing contrast issues and exploring accessible color options is also made much easier using an HSLuv color picker, where only the lightness slider alters the contrast checks, and not the hue/saturation sliders (most tools use HSL, where hue/saturation changes counterintuitively alter contrast checks which makes accessibility really tough!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- You can tweak the hue/saturation/lightness of every tint/shade. This is useful because autogenerated colors are never quite right, and customization is really important for branding work when you have to include specific tints/shades. The curve-based hue/saturation/lightness editing UI also makes this a really quick process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Instead of just a handful of colors, this tool lets you create a full palette. For example, if your primary color is blue, you always end up needing other colors like green for success, red for danger, and gray for text, then 11 tints/shades for all of these, so you want a tool that lets you tweak, check, compare and manage them all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's mostly a demo on mobile so check it on desktop. I'm still working on making it easier to use as it probably requires some design background to understand, but really open to feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still WithAudio https://desktop.with.audio . It's getting some attention and has actually sold licences!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone asked for a free license in exchange of detailed private review and bug reports. They have reported more than 10 bugs so far. I'm working on some of them right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WithAudio is a one time payment text to speech reader app. It's one time payment because it has no server and no recurring cost! A nice side effect of this is it's 100% private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slowly degoogling my life. Switched to FastMail a while ago, it works. Have written a simple shopping and todo list web app, and a minimal photo gallery. All very simple, mostly for one user only: Myself. Using these as excuses to learn about coding with LLMs. As I have retired a few years ago, I can afford the time, and work with no stress or deadlines. Also slowly improving my beer tracker system. All this as perl-based cgis under Apache, running on my home server/workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://www.numeromoney.com/pricing I don't even have the home page put together yet so marketing is still on the starting blocks! It's web app for helping to understand how you spend your money. I'm keeping it as simple as possible while trying to surface clear information about a persons spending. It came out of personal need (young families are expensive, it turns out!), and the existing products out there - YNAB etc were just too focused on budgeting. I just wanted to know where my money goes so I can focus on where I'm not spending it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been on a break from coding for about a month but was last working on a new kind of "uncertainty reducing" hierarchical agent management system. I have a writeup of the project here: https://symbolflux.com/working-group-foundations.html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making a web app that let's you create a QR code that you print and stick on your shop door or car windshield. When a stranger scans it, you'd get a notification on your telegram account or email without exposing your details. Kinda like a pager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep on grinding on my Kubernetes IDE that allowed me to quit my day job over 3 years ago: https://aptakube.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also been playing with Bun and I have a business idea that would be a good fit, and huge potential but I just don’t have enough time to start something new anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Paperboy (https://www.paper-boy.app/) a self-hostable service that generates a personalized daily research digest from recent arXiv papers (and optionally a few other sources).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It fetches new papers, scores them against a “research profile,” then produces concise summaries plus a short “why this matters” style rationale, and outputs an email/newsletter-like HTML digest. There’s also a small API for generating a digest, checking status, and previewing the render.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built it because keyword alerts and generic newsletters were either too noisy or missed the stuff that was actually relevant to what I’m working on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HALUD YOUR HORSES is a small containerized development workflow designed to reduce exposure to supply-chain attacks in the JavaScript and Node.js ecosystem. Every project runs inside an isolated container with its own node_modules volume. Nothing from npm executes directly on the host machine. The tools are simple shell scripts that create, enter, and fork project-specific development images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been knocking around and getting various false starts on three ideas for a while…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- a videogame. I've got a pretty killer idea in an open niche, but the indie market is so massively oversaturated that it feels impossible to get eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- a next-generation post-RSS newsreader. But news is so depressing these days. I think most of the world wants to ostrich and I don't blame them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- a reboot of Svpply, my own shuttered startup. I'd love to just make (another) thing that's about excellent clothes and shoes and artisanal pocketknives, but the way the economy is going, this feels grotesque. I was lucky to make it the first time when luxury goods were attainable _and_ normal people could pay for necessities; that window has closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;im build an offline-first iPad-focused Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons campaign app called Campaign Codex. i got inspired by watching Critical Role and saw a bunch of them using iPads during their sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;thought it would be cool to build something like this. im still building but feel free to download it via testflight and give some feedback: https://testflight.apple.com/join/kM4udJSZ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time I've been looking to solve the repetitive schema pattern issues in SQL. This week I created a DSL that allows parametric polymorphism for SQL, and I wrote a compiler for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mentioned this a few months ago, but have made progress since - I'm working on an alternative to subscriptions for online publications. Instead of subscribing to entire publications / blogs, publishers would register their publication on this network and configure thresholds and pricing. Add a bit of code to the site and a paywall will show up, allowing readers to pay for individual articles. The prices would be minimal, amounting to less than a dollar in most cases. i.e. reading articles using micro-transactions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it's been tried before, but I thought I'd attack it with a few different angles - web based, no chrome extension, thresholds to help verify the article is worth it, extensive use of an aggregator to help with discovery and validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Gluze (https://gluze.com) as a choose your own adventure story builder app. Trying to build stories where the reader gets to navigated and guide the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm polishing up the second edition of "Hidden Markov Models and Dynamical Systems." The book explains several state space models and connects them to ideas about chaos. Here's a link to a pdf draft: https://www.fraserphysics.com/book.pdf and here's a link to source for the book: https://gitlab.com/fraserphysics/hmmds Once you install the source software, you can build a pdf for the book by typing "make book". I think that makes it reproducible research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building an application that can communicate with my Plex server, and also communicate with APIs like MusicBrainz and Spotify. From there I want to be able to track my Plex music rating history, and export playlists on Plex to Spotify for easier sharing with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There don't seem to be many automated tools out there that fit my need for this, so building out my own solution I have complete control over makes sense. It's a lot of fun to build this out exactly as I want to, rather than trying to configure a bunch of tools that I'm not familiar with and that don't meet my needs exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tooling I'm building up around this should hopefully make it easier for myself to get my playlists and track ratings off of Plex if I ever decide to abandon it for music listening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lite³: a binary format encoding JSON documents as a serialized B-tree, making it possible to construct iterators on them directly and query internal fields at indexed speeds. It is still a serialized document (possible to send over a network), though now you don't need to do any parsing, since the document itself is already indexed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When overwriting fixed-sized values like integers or floats, the old value can simply be overwritten. Holes are only left if the overriding values do not fit in the old location (strings, byte arrays).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To clean up unused space, you start an iterator at the root of the document and recursively write to a new buffer. This will clean up all the unused space. This operation can be delayed by the application for as long as they wish, until the size trade-off outweighs the cost of rebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on hand-building mugs. Throwing clay around in a studio, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I'm also thinking about it as a product manager based on my tech experience. Looking at what people like in mugs, creating templates to exactly size the mugs to people's preferences, creating re-usable molds to put repeatable components together, and taking detailed notes on exactly what I am doing in-studio to create a repeatable, reliable process to create a product that will sell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is going poorly so far, but each iteration gets better, so hopefully I have everything down before I end up with 100+ unsellable mugs in my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on LLMParty for some months. It is a collection of experiments that use LLM under the hood. For each experiment I tried to play with something different, such interaction, LLM knowledge, use, etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Vocabuo (https://vocabuo.com/), a vocabulary-focused language learning app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two main differences between this and other Anki-like apps: 1) The words you learn are from YT videos, websites and ebooks you import in the app. 2) The flashcards are optimized specifically for learning vocabulary - cards automatically get audio, images, multiple sentence examples, words definitions etc. It can also create fully monolingual flashcards with just definitions or the words in dialogs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest flex is that I have users who have done more swipes than me (over 100,000).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web maps usually join together lots of small images called tiles (this is why you see square patches as google earth/map loads). They do this by querying a "tile server" API. It turns out this standard can also be leveraged to label and fine-tune models on map imagery. In my day job we built infra to efficiently serve imagery through tile servers for map visualization. So I wanted to test out ML applications of that infra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computing entropies of high-dimensional random vectors for a theoretical neuroscience study. The journey is mostly a repetition of (1) almost giving up because it's completely hopeless, (2) taking a hot shower, (3) realizing there might actually be a path forward, (4) almost giving up because it's completely hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a full identity and authorization platform targeted for service-to-service use cases. But my focus the last couple months has been to make provisioning identity super easy, and I think I've done that (at least compared to something like SPIRE).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if anybody has CI/CD pipelines, AI agents, edge-functions, or multi-cloud workloads they want to give auditable identity, I can help!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are too many LLM-related projects. Setting up multiple runtimes, Python, Node, Go, Rust and then some environments, different CUDA versions, dependencies is tedious. Managing updates later is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I'm building a toolkit that allows to keep things simple for the end user. Run Ollama and Open WebUI configured to work together: `harbor up ollama webui`. Don't like Ollama? Then `harbor up llamacpp webui`. There are 17 backends, 14 frontends and 50+ different satellite projects, config profiles that can be imported from a URL, tunnels, and a helper desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a game for playdate, part time for the last year+. It's a wonderful device and community. The hardware constraints are extremely freeing, and inspires creativity. Mostly Lua, but if you want to push the boundaries, you need to go fairly low level C, and I've found pushing in those boundaries to be just a blast. It's great platform if you're interested in a game dev hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on an AEO engine which focuses on optimising webflow website so they show at searches when someone is doing at chatgpt, perplexity and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A database desktop client, built with Tauri &amp;amp; SvelteKit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But there are many already!" I hear the crowd exclaim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I respond, "Yes, but..."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's really something I want for myself. Lightweight, as fast as humanly possible, extensible via plugins (in fact the entire app is mostly plugins, with a small core to glue it together), and a tiny bit of LLM (call it AI if you wish) integration to ask questions about the database or generate/review queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi HN — I’m Gerome, and I’m working on CodinIT.dev.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: CodinIT.dev is a local-first, open-source AI full-stack app builder that turns natural-language prompts into prototype → production web apps. It supports local/self-hosted workflows, connects to databases (Supabase), includes an integrated terminal and git automation, and plugs into 19+ AI providers so you can iterate fast. Download desktop app at https://codinit.dev .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few quick facts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What it does: Generate full-stack code from prompts, preview instantly, and deploy anywhere — built for indie hackers who want full control of there code without vendor lock ins (open source).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where the code lives: active repo and org on GitHub — org name is codinit-dev.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to try it: download and run locally; the dev flow runs with pnpm run dev and serves locally from your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Progress &amp;amp; current priorities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stabilising the live code execution sandbox and improving safety/UX for file uploads and agent orchestration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tightening integrations with community LLM providers and adding more framework templates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving contributor docs and reducing onboarding friction so people can run it locally without hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to poke around, try the app or the GitHub org and open issues/PRs. I’ll hang around to answer technical questions here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we pile more and more abstractions on top with AI, I have been on a really fulfilling quest fueled by curiosity to go more low level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of assembly, C, WASM and plan to top it off with a look at GPU instructions and PTX. I haven't learned as much as in the last two months in years, it's been great. And surprisingly everything has turned out to be much simpler and easier to implement than expected once demystified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now to be fair, AI has sometimes given me pointers when I didn't fully understand something. Using Gemini 3 for free has been nice in that regard. However I consciously try to only implement code myself and to actually make sure I learned something that sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm again toying around with the idea of building an ActivityPub Server built around the principles of RDF, JSON-LD and the Linked Data Platform. [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can work already as a "Generic" ActivityPub server and it can be made to work with Client-to-Server API, but given that there are not mature clients for that, I am now in the middle of an exercise where I am taking the existing server and implementing Lemmy's and Mastodon's APIs based on top of it. Once I can get any Lemmy and a Mastodon client working, I will then start changing their own SDKs, and then I can replace calls from their application-specific APIs with direct calls to Linked Data server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating an we autobattler game https://lfarroco.itch.io/mana-battle It is being a good experience to learn how to work with shaders, and how well Electron apps run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had some custom build scripts and sites for my dad and myself and was thinking I could make a simple SaaS out of it. Super early and didn’t advertise anywhere yet since the actual dashboard is very simple right now but it works and I keep adding the features I want to use myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week I spun up a HN clone for digital nomad news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I was researching DNS and global mobility, and wanted to share links with others, figured I'd just spin up a link site (though I'm still the only user).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One unique difference is I have a field for English Title, since I consume a lot of Korean &amp;amp; Japanese articles and want to share these, but don't want to have people translate the titles before they understand why they should read them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still exploring new forms of AI-powered learning tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest thing I’ve been working on is an adaptive mode inspired by the LECTOR paper [1]. Where each lesson is a single learning concept with a mastery score tight to it based on your understanding of the said concept, so in principle the system can reintroduce concepts you didn’t fully grasp later on, ideally making separate flashcards unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be self-hosted if any one want's to give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems really nice, and looks like something I have been wanting to exist for some time. I will definitely play with it when I have some time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know this is a personal project and you maybe didn't want to make it public, but I think the README.md would be better suited with a section about the actual product. I clicked on it wanting to learn more, but with no time to test it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the feedback, I did update the README and included all the futures and also there is https://talimio.com, I think it shows the future in a better way visually&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im building a calendar for my car navigation system https://e39.dev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last winter I built a Matrix client for it. This time around I want to wrap Akonadi with a DBus shim and consume that model in custom calendar widgets and UX I’m making for a rotary knob ui.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to run the same app on an intel atom tablet on the side of my fridge, with a Griffin PowerMate hooked up to it for input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a fun project; rejuvenating a 1978 Chess Engine https://github.com/billforsternz/zargon. It's the second time I've worked on the same engine. The first time I got it working nicely on modern machines, running four orders of magnitude faster than in in 1978. This time I hope to get it running much faster than that. I found a bug in the 1978 Z80 assembly the other day. A blog post "Fixing a 50 year old bug..." or similar suggests itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on something called Kopi: a CLI tool that replaces the slow process of restoring massive production database backups on a dev machine with a "surgical slicing" approach, spinning up lightweight, referentially intact Docker containers in seconds: It spins up the exact schema of your source db and generates safe, synthetic datasets in seconds. It can, if you want, also replicate the actual data in the source DB but with automatically anonymized PII data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can replicate a DB in as little as 9 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's Open Core: Community Edition and Pro/Enterprise editions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Store your graphs in Parquet files on object storage or DuckDB files and query them using strongly typed Cypher. Advanced factorized join algorithms (details in a VLDB 2023 paper when it was called Kuzu).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking to serve externalized knowledge with small language models using this infra. Watch Andrej Karpathy's Cognitive Core podcasts more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is something that started as a passion project - I wanted to see just how effective of a typing application I could make to help people improve typing speed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s very data driven and personalized. We analyze a lot of key weak points about a user’s typing and generate natural text (using LLMs) that target multiple key weak points at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally we have a lot of typing modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Code typing practice; we support 20+ programming languages - daily typing test - target practice; click on on any stat in the results and we generate natural text that uses a lot of that (bigrams, trigrams, words, fingers, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refresh Agent is an AI Agent for SEO and Marketing Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried to use Google Analytics (GA4) and Google Search Console (GSC) to figure out what's working with your marketing, and what to do next to grow, you have probably got frustrated at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It acts as a Marketing Strategist. You can ask questions like "why is my SEO traffic down this week" and it will give you a clear answer based on your site's performance data, as well as a checklist to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm spending too much time doing ancillary stuff for my HomeAssistant setup. For example, I'm trying to generalize MQTT publishing for Bash and Python scripts on my home network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on building an investment assistant backed by real time data. ChatGPT and Perplexity finance are amazing, but all of them are based on web search data only, which is a big limitation in finance since realtime data is important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have an agent that has access to almost every data point you can think of in the stock market (as much as we can get), which gets leveraged before answering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we also figured out ways to build amazing charts in between answer snippets, which looks very cool. Investors are usually very visual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://tagbase.io … our mission is to stop counterfeits and empower brands. And as the CTO I have the privilege to play with all the nice technologies: Elixir both on the web and Raspberry Pis via the https://nerves-project.org. Having an IT background I love the challenges that come with hardware design and to learn new stuff because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nope, as we configure the tags. For now we support to industry standard chips from NXP, but this will expand in the future to other manufacturers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next step is to integrate a visual data pipeline by using ImNodes. I‘m slowly making progress in my experiments, but C++ has a steep learning curve, especially when targeting MacOS and Windows at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the recent work done enabling the use of Common Lisp in the browser on WASM, I've been thinking about spinning up a really simple static site that's just a CL REPL for people to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever since I tried grok imagine I became obsessed with the idea of re-imagining classical paintings or animating them so I created https://ravaan.art I don't necessarily have a vision for it, so if you think it is cool tell me what you think could be added to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, awesome mate, fascinating. I just checked the tech stack and found you are using Next.js. very minor issue. The OG Meta tag pointing to your localhost url, please fix it :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the heads up! I had taken it further locally with a landing page and a blog section (empty for now) but didn't finish up the deploying it. I will patch this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a multi platform client for ATProto servers, like Bluesky. The emphasis is on a clean orthogonal UI, running on platforms the default client doesn't run on, and better use of screen space on small devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a work in progress, but it's at a stage where if you ask nicely I'll let you know where to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of apps that can be built on ATProto, the PDS, etc. If you are exploring the same space I'd especially like to hear from you. I'm easy to find, which is the most useful thing about being named Zigurd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fastest knowledge base for software teams, Outcrop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of teams enjoy using Linear for product management but still have to use Notion and Confluence for knowledge management. I’ve built Outcrop from the ground up to be fast with much more reliable search and realtime collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of teams from startups and major companies have signed up for early access and many have made early commitments to support the development of Outcrop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your team would be interested, I’d like to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This weekend I'm working on a new song for my NES game, Tactus. I've been busy setting up the business and preparing for its first outing at a convention, so it was nice to relax and just create for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on https://qave.chat, Wanted Slack to be more supportive for developers so been iterating on feature parity with Slack but optimised for developer workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks like keyboard driven commands, secrets store (to be done) and scripts that you can write and store without spinning up a new server (easier chat ops)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still in early alpha so after a few more polish it'll be ready, but you can try it right now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I built a very simple metrics tracker that I had been looking for myself... a middle ground between complex observability platforms and tracking a number yourself and then finding a way to visualise its change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had had the idea and the domain registered for years and recently just took the leap to put it out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm not working on college applications, I'm working on my HS senior capstone project: Porting the Bridge Designer[0] to the web. So far we've got bridges rendered statically and the load simulation working in code (no load visualisations yet). I intend to post it here when it's ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm about to launch a new (now free) version of my Mac app, CurrentKey, which helps you keep track of workflows across macOS Spaces and track how you use your Mac. https://www.currentkey.com It had been a subscription app (4.5 stars) pulling in a few thousand per year, but I recently decided to try to broaden its appeal and make it free. The new version will launch within a day or two (the launch build is just "Waiting for Review" in App Store connect).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been building a crypto market visualization and simulation tool because I kept running into the same problem: TradingView is great for charts, but it’s hard to answer simple “what-if” questions like would rotating into another coin actually have helped or did trimming and buying back improve outcomes, or just feel good in hindsight. So I started building tools that simulate these scenarios directly on historical data. For example: - flipping from coin A into coin B and back again over a chosen period - selling part of a position and buying back later after a drawdown&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still early and adding ideas as I go, but it’s already helped me questions I had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a way to make it super easy to create and share beautiful photo galleries that tell a story. Take your folders with photos and create a web gallery that works great on all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project has a CLI interface that is free and open-source, but you have to self-host the gallery. We are also building a SaaS app which is basically a managed version of the open-source tool with a visual builder and we take care of the hosting and CDN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tinygrad’s small set of operations and laziness made it easy to implement. Tho my overall sense is that neural network verification is currently more of a research interest than something practical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on an open-source thing that lets you co-draw diagrams with an LLM inside draw.io/diagrams.net.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can ask the model to rough out an AWS/GCP/Azure architecture, but the key part is the loop: you still have the normal editor, so you drag boxes, rename stuff, add your own bits, and then say things like “clean this up”, “split this service out”, “add a read replica here”. The AI edits the real draw.io XML, it’s not just generating a picture, so you and the model are basically sharing the same canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can also try to rebuild a diagram from a screenshot/PDF and then you keep iterating together in chat + manual edits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I added “bring your own API key” for a bunch of providers and support for uploading PDFs/text to turn existing docs into diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overly specific LLM research into KV cache eviction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of tokens in a sequence will be irrelevant to an attention mechanism outside of a very small window. Right now however we tend to either keep all cache values forever, or dump them all once they hit a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My theory is that you can train model to look at the key vectors and from that information alone work out how long to keep a the token in the cache for. Results so far look promising and it’s easy to add after the fact without retraining the core model itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Place discovery companion that de-noises your environment. Repeatable, one-stop-shop for information, personalized. Quick to decision. Updates live (best on mobile).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are passionate travelers with 30k km under our wheels and we want consistent information across places we find ourselves at. Now are trying to figure out how to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a blog post about default behaviour in ONNX Runtime when using the CoreML execution provider. Basically the default args lead to your model being ran in FP16 not FP32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi, all! Please check out the Freetracer RC build! It is a FOSS, native, privacy-focused ISO/BIN/other common bootable image formats flasher to removable media, written in Zig!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bookmarks assistant. A simple place to save all your links, find them with chat. The app automatically adds summaries to all links and send you an update of what you saved every Sunday morning. More features coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It helps to comprehend research papers (and not only papers - any document on any language) faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool is free to use, because we have credits from GCP. I guess at some point we'll need to introduce some level of subscription fee to keep it alive and useful, as it uses LLMs and vector search quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legal-tech: Using AI to help attorneys bill flat-rate instead of hourly. It's data intensive, but possible if you go through their old time entries and tell them the flat-rate price of all of their hourly work. 93% of attorneys bill hourly, primarily b/c they don't have any sense of the cost of the upcoming work. DM me if you want to work on these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun/Passion-Project: A small advent calendar featuring (weird) Acro-Yoga flows we collected throughout 2025. (Acro-Yoga is a partner sport combining acrobatics and therapeutics, you should try it, it's a really great sport!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started working on a training plan builder after getting frustrated with trying to use an existing service (trainingpeaks) and not finding the controls intuitive enough without being a coach in their system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted something local and offline first + 10-20% better than excel, think I'm missing a few features other might find useful, but it works for my needs which has been great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run a small logistics platform called Twinjet that is used by mostly food delivery courier companies. One of our main features is parsing emails from food ordering platforms in order to automatically add the delivery job to the company's dispatch board. These parsers need constant maintenance since the ordering platforms change their email formats all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm putting the finishing touches on an AI parser that I hope to ship after the new year. I'm getting very consistent results from Ministral-3b model, which is super light weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating Daino Qt - a collection of components that makes Qt apps feel and look native on both Desktops and mobiles (each with its own set of challenges).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing Qt apps with C++ and QML is a blast - the fast performance of C++ and ease of use of writing UI in QML. But there is so much left to be desired with the built-in Qt Quick components - mobile issues like non native text handling, non native swipe-able stack view and much more. I’m aiming to bridge that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's still native (in terms of performance and ability to customize the look and feel) and working pretty well, it's just that not enough effort was put into making the built-in components behave and look like those on the platforms it runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make localhosting (https://thelocalhostinger.dev/localhosting) a thing. It's about finding ways to strip away unnecessary complexity of selfhosting in very specific edge use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a specialized web app for temporary chat sessions. It is an open-source, privacy-first solution featuring Zero Persistence. Right now, the focus is on the image messaging system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An RSS aggregator app. Open source, self-hostable, and I'm running a free hosted instance at the moment. This is the first time I have ever gotten to the stage of having live users in a prod environment for my own apps. Pretty cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a little extra tool for my reservation system, which simulates guests reserving accommodations before a customer launches. This is nice if you have no idea how users will respond to your availability and options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have an ML model that's trained on real reservations and use an LLM to decide why a user mightve opted out. We apply personas to this LLM to get a bit of a sense how they would probably be operating the booking flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently built a simple JSON schema form builder for my own purposes. I'm going to expand on it with the ability to send forms via email, handle bigger and more complex forms and then tackle document parsing. https://data-atlas.net for anyone into that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on updating my Your-Age-in-Days app[1] for iOS 26. The main motivation was to have the days I've lived always available on the lock screen with a more native feel than the workaround I had before (nightly Shortcut which updates the background image and adds the current number as an overlay to it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At work I'm implementing new 3D map geometry stuff for my employer (Mapbox) and as a a sideproject I'm building a simple 3D modeling software that gets you from idea to reliable, solid parts fast (https://www.adashape.com/).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a single-node job scheduler for Linux. Large HPC clusters use schedulers like SLURM or PBS to manage allocation of resources to users, but these systems are quite overkill when all you have is a single node shared by a few users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am trying to offload as much of the complex stuff to existing parts of the kernel, like using systemd/cgroups for resource limiting and UNIX sockets for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal productivity app. Mirrors contents of a file (TODO list and other info) on your phone. You can make a call with Grok to brainstorm specifics. The goal was to remove any friction possible, to make focus easier. https://github.com/predkambrij/focusapp&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to solve the brachistochrone problem by numerical optimization. I started with the minimal surface problem to get a foot in the door: I discretize the integral as a sum of constributions that depend on the function values at specific points, then use autograd libraries for optimizing a non-linear scalar loss function&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Reflect [0], it’s a privacy-focused app for self-tracking and self-discovery. You can track metrics, run self-experiments, set goals, view correlations, visualize your data, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m very been trying to get into hardware more. This years project was a speaker which is nearly done (with a few weeks to spare).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next years (and probably a couple years after) is an electro-mechanical smart watch. Sourced some Ronda GB22 gearbox motors and tritium tubes and planning on using a pcb for the face. What could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on "Next Arc Research" — https://nextarcresearch.com - a wrapper around my curiosity to understand how AI, compute, and capital might change markets by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not a trading tool or product. More like a weekly, machine-assisted research project. Each cycle I run analyses on 120+ public companies across semiconductors, cloud, biotech, energy, robotics, quantum and crypto. The framing is inspired by Emad Mostaque’s “The Last Economy” thesis — the idea that when intelligence becomes cheap, the physics of value creation start to look very different. I originally built it for myself and retail investors in my family but I figure it could have more general utility so prettied it up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system uses large-model reasoning (GPT-5+ though I've also tested Sonnet, Gemini and Grok) combined with structured scoring across technology maturity, risk, competitive positioning, and alignment to AI-era dynamics. The output is static HTML dashboards, PDFs, and CSVs that track month-over-month shifts. I'm adding to it weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly I’m trying to answer questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Which companies are structurally positioned for outsized upside in The Last Economy?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* How should I deliver the research so that it would have been actionable to someone like me 30 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* What signals would help folks identify “the next NVIDIA” 5 years earlier?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inference costs real $$$ so I've set up a Patreon that, hopefully, will allow me to scale coverage and extend the modelling and methodology. There is a free tier and some recent, complete example output on the web site. I'm also happy to gift a free month for folks willing to provide constructive feedback: https://www.patreon.com/NextArcResearch/redeem/CC2A2 - in particular I'm looking for feedback on how to make the research more actionable without drifting into "financial advice".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't collect any data but Patreon does for authentication and Cloudflare does to deliver Pages. The Last Economy is here: https://ii.inc/web/the-last-economy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty simple, really. Cloud native app that scrapes job postings for higher ed institutions, then send me a daily summary based on a handful of keywords. Mostly targeting something to find remote jobs offered through schools. I like working in Higher Ed and my wife is looking for a remote job. Seems like it should be easy to vibe code and run in a free tier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing everything local councils do in the UK at https://opencouncil.network - trying to help people feel like they know who and what they’re voting for next May.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been incredibly rewarding to see people’s changing opinions of their local government&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been getting back into movies this year and my 2018 laptop has reached the stage where it’s no longer useful as an everyday tool, so I’m turning it into a home media server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m only a couple days in, and I’ve already learned so much about networks, containers, codecs, ffmpeg, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residential solar PV+ESS w/net metering. Rushing to finish connecting it all for inspection on tuesday... if I'm lucky and get commissioned this year I can get the last federal tax incentives. Fingers crossed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on understanding why this thread gets hundreds of comments and upvotes while threads with the same name posted by other users don't get this much engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Ward, a Chrome extension that detects browser scams/phishing using lightweight LLM models. Our target persona is elders, young children, and anyone who's not as tech savvy. When explaining it to people, I call it a "modern antivirus", because it can detect anything from malicious scripts on a page to grey-area misinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm bootstrapping and covering LLM costs for Ward's first couple hundred users (got about 50 users at the moment) to improve it. We have a local mode for added privacy and are dipping our feet to gauge biz. interest (client-side phishing protection is unparalleled).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've recommended it to friends, colleagues and loved ones. I dogfood my own product, and it even surprises me every day how much more mindful it makes me of my browsing of harmful content. Would love to get feedback and testers from HN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building an app for winter sports. You can download the map for a ski resort, and use the map to see where individuals in your group are, and suggest meetups (summits) on the map, and everyone gets a personalized route generated to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like somewhere in the last decade we've all lost control over our email inboxes. While it would certainly be possible to filter and sort it, I've been wondering if it makes sense to just start with a system that is designed to intake a bunch of streams of information. Then it could be pointed at the raw information e.g event calendars and news-letters as well as streams like Facebook groups/Instagram where I don't want to actually go to those apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking at a meta-level, this seems like what we should really be using LLMs for right now: use-cases where user controls what is done on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ML experiment: "skill capsules" for LLM. Capsules can be cheaply extracted from successful episodes (as little as a single episode) and then applied to improve success of similar tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for that feedback! Yes - I do plan on upgrading to a real external microphone soon. For the time being it is the camera's internal mic, which is admittedly, not great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build to help you save and organize links without friction. Group related content into collections, pin critical resources for quick access, and search your entire knowledge base instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since getting laid off in May and failing to find any jobs for ML in healthcare, I am working with a friend I met during my MPH to start a boutique consultancy to help hospitals deploy AI / health technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building my own static site generator using vanilla Python and SQLite for my personal blog and Notion-like second-brain https://github.com/danielfalbo/prev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on my bussiness which is related to moving and packing its mostly inside kigdom of Saudi Arabia. Name of my bussiness is moverstoo my website is https://moverstoo.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you mind elaborating more about the use case? Postgres itself is heavily engineered around OS process boundaries for both correctness and resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Puzzleship - a free daily puzzles website with the archives paywalled. Right now it has Logic Grid Puzzles and Zebra Puzzles. I'm pretty proud of the LGP generator algorithm and some experienced players also liked the way the puzzles are constructed. This is my first subscription site and it's been online for about 15 days, so I'm learning a lot and trying to figure out the pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banker.so | Computer inside a computer inside an agent&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started this out by building a spreadsheet controlled by an LLM. Now putting a direct filesystem inside, simplified enough to have programmatic control of slide builders, spreadsheets, terminals and vibecoding applications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been playing/building Maggielab.com an online, non-destructive, simple image editor. Made it for my wife because she really doesn't play well with image editors :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://www.pleeboo.com/ is a who-brings-what kind of tool for organising poltucks, school events or any kind of gathering where tasks need to be distributed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a bot for chatrooms (irc, discord) that will drop in and roast you (llm powers) in front of the whole server randomly, completely out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I made a model skinner for Tribes 2, a ~25 year old game that still has a loyal following: https://exogen.github.io/t2-model-skinner/ (if you check out the Gallery link there, you'll notice this app resulted in a whole new wave of skins, and even a Halloween skin contest)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To satisfy the urge of doing something else ambitious in the browser, I'm now doing the same thing for Tribes 2 maps: trying to make a web-based map viewer and editor: https://exogen.github.io/t2-mapper/ (editing/creation part still in progress)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got this working for most maps pretty quickly. It translates the mission object tree from the Torque .mis files into a Three.js scene graph. Eventually though, I noticed that some mission definitions were more dynamic – Torque .mis files are really just TorqueScript .cs files with a different extension and some pragma/magic comments. So, to actually handle every map would require not just a mission file parser, but a whole TorqueScript runtime. Implementing THAT part seemed really tedious and, frankly, uninteresting to me. So I had Claude Code get a whole TorqueScript transpiler and runtime working. Now, when you load a mission, it actually runs all the same scripts that Tribes 2 runs to load the mission, all the way from server.cs and its `CreateServer()` function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, I'm continuing to get its rendering matching Tribes 2 as closely as possible, and setting things up so that live editing of missions will work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding more LSP features to the jinja linter for saltstack that I wrote, so you can see all the bugs in your templates from VSCode (rather than waiting for CI) and do things like “rename this jinja variable everywhere it’s being used”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;thecutline.ai , a Product Management Suite. I call it "A Product Manager That Says No", which stems from previous challenges I had using AI that was too sycophantic and optimistic to help with product decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working heavily right now on Customer Personas to use in validating/invalidating , which are configured with viewpoints, biases, and tendencies. Coming very soon will be Persona Journeys, in which you can get live, goal-oriented evaluation of your web app by a Persona.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My initial goal is to make a functional SillyTavern (AI roleplaying) replacement. SillyTavern builds prompts from a few rigid buckets (character, scenario, lore, system prompt, author's note...), which makes complex setups hard to manage. Content gets duplicated, settings have to be toggled in multiple places, and it’s easy to accidentally carry or modify state across conversations. Over time, it becomes difficult to tell what context is actually in effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building an alternative that treats context as small, reusable pieces that can be composed and organized flexibly, rather than locked into fixed categories. Characters, settings, and behaviors can be mixed, reused, or temporarily enabled without duplication or manual cleanup, and edits preserve clear history instead of rewriting the past. The goal is to make managing complex context deliberate and controlled instead of fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although I’m trying to get the functionality required for roleplaying done first, the app is generic enough for other AI workflows where fine-grained, explicit context control is an improvement over existing chat interfaces. Think: start a new conversation with an assistant and start checking off rules, documents, and instructions to apply to the chat. Regenerate responses with clarifications or additional one-time context layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dug out a few of my $5 raspberry pi zeros, setting them up for various things. hosting server, vpn server, digital picture frame, home assistant device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses your existing subscriptions and supports all the major CLI and API providers. There's no cloud features of Omnispect itself, it runs locally except for calls to the LLM providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is used as a routing agent, which selects the most appropriate LLM provider and model tier to delegate a task to. For example, the routing agent might delegate a single large task to GPT-5, which in turn delegates multiple small tasks to Haiku agents in parallel, then Gemini reviews all the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Omnispect lets you view the delegation tree of prompts and responses that spawn from your initial prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memecoin launchpad and dex on the solana chain. One giant player in the space and we’re going to shake things up a bit. Should launch January - send.fun&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tool for K8S operators that replaces brittle imperative reconciliation code with type-safe state machines generated from declarative YAML definitions. It also bundles error handling / logging / metrics / traces for state transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure if I'm missing a better tool but trying to keep a good working mental model of this has been a nightmare for the operators I've maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;www.dolphinwhispers.com I working on the Android app to chat with dolphins using underwater whistles. The current version works well and is about to be used with free dolphins near Spain. We do not support captivity and we don't want our work to promote captivity or to increase revenues from captivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Home, on going work to get local Kubernetes dev env running as close to a production one as possible - ingress, external-dns, ACME CA, load balancer, Argo, registry, prom-operator etc., running entirely locally. Work, similar but in Docker Desktop on Windows and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Longer term personal aim is a self-hosting platform based on k8s with straight forward bootstrap, similar to Yunohost but k8s based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;working on a way to ease the burden of the firehose of information that is current AI news and research. there are hunderds of new research papers everyday, and yeah, skimming is a thing, but i feel like there is a ton of alpha distributed thorugh all of them that would just require a superhuman ability to read, comprehend and test all of it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m (possibly) over-engineering a new personal site using SvelteKit. It’s a blog + public project tracker. All the site content is created and edited using Obsidian, and there’s a build script that parses all the markdown in the vault when the site is built. I’m planning on working on several new projects next year and wanted a place to document them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A local, cli based task and record manager, focused on simplicity and speed but includes support like managing schedules and records and searches etc to support it being a structured schedule helper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;II’m currently working on Focusflows.eu, a tool I’m building to help people improve their focus while working or studying. At the same time, I’m exploring new ideas around productivity and digital well-being, and experimenting with features that make it easier to stay focused without feeling overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not working on anything at all. I'm stuck in SAFe planning meetings for the next week. I fucking hate the whole thing but they pay me to sit there and watch others play with their Miro boards, so Merry Christmas you filthy animals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a webapp that lets you create wish lists and share them with family and friends. The key feature is the claim system: when someone decides to buy you an item, they can claim it so others know it's taken, but you never see who claimed what or even that it was claimed at all. The surprise stays intact. You can also split big purchases. If someone wants a $400 stand mixer, multiple people can chip in allowing family tight on cash to feel like they're contributing without having family members feel like they have to put small items on their list just so everyone can contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kept it deliberately simple. No social features, no feeds, no ads. Just lists with items, links, prices, and notes. You create a list, share the link, and you're done. No group chat gymnastics required. It's free to use. I built this because I wanted it to exist, not because I had some grand monetization plan. You can sign up and create lists without a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been taking some time off from https://gethly.com, as majority of functionality I wanted to implement and offer to customers is done, so it's mostly just some tweaks here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was pondering doing something in regards to decentralised consummation of content. I am beginning to see how various websites are walling off their content and centralising everything whilst also monetising access to it for themselves and kicking content creators out, forcing them to run their own websites and use multiple backup platforms(mostly the dying youtube).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I was thinking about flipping it on its head and instead of going to different websites to consume this content, like youtube, twitter and whatnot, people would have a single program to aggregate it instead. Then it occurred to me that this is what RSS/Atom was made for, kind of. So I am just letting the idea marinate for a bit and maybe next year I will look into it. Mastodon might have some good concepts in it that I want to look into and also come up with some standardised way for richer content that creators could provide beyond RSS to make it more palatable and easier consumable for users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a visual language learning app called Snapalabra!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: You look at an image and describe what you see in your target language. That's basically it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My reason for building it was that even though I can understand a lot of spoken spanish, I really struggle to construct sentences on the fly when speaking. Doing a few minutes of active learning like this each day really helps remap my brain a little, and I quickly run into situations where I hit a wall and realize I actually don't understand something as well as i had thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app also gives a little feedback on what i have written from an llm, and it also provides clues that I have mapped to each image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment I am using it mainly for intermediate Spanish and beginner Irish, and personally I find it really helpful for both. Basically learning vocan for Irish, and more serious sentence structure etc. in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people absolutely hate the idea of mixing LLMs with language learning, and I can kind of see why, but I personally find it really helpful in certain cases. If you are already doing classes, and consuming content in your target language I think something like this will be really helpful for a 5 minute coffee-break type activity in the morning. Its not a language course and I have not intention for it to be one. Its just a supplementary little tool that helps with getting your brain thinking in a new language and it is free to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few links if anyone thinks it might be interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TLDR the incremental compiler rewrite is finally bearing fruit. Namely, because we no longer have a batch compiler (i.e. we don't bail on the first error), we can&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- provide LSP results (hover, goto def, etc) on non-broken parts of your isograph literals, even in the presence of errors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- surface those errors in VSCode, and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- fix those errors with auto-fixes!! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNWbVOjpQw&amp;amp;t=314s) Which is to say, select a field that doesn't exist, and let the compiler create the isograph literal declaring it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm soon to beta my first macOS app: AlgoMommy. AlgoMommy helps you organize your video clips prior to editing them in Final Cut Pro / DaVinci Resolve / etc. It replaces the manual and time-consuming process of "filing" your newly-recorded video clips (CLIP_5213.mp4, CLIP_5214.mp4, ...) into a sensible folder hierarchy (Wedding/B-Rolls/, Wedding/Reception/, ...), so that you can focus on creating and your content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been a fun project so far for me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* First time using Claude Code. CC has made writing code fun again (I'm an experienced software developer, with - gasp - over 20 years of professional experience).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* On macOS, WhisperKit + Apple Intelligence (SpeechAnalyzer) is a powerful combination for offline transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're interested in joining the beta, feel free to send me an email: diarmuid.glynn@gmail.com. The software is working now, but the documentation and website ( https://www.algomommy.com/ ) are unfinished, so I'd like to provide direct support to any interested beta users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom Copilot alternative / extension because I no longer believe it is a good idea to let Big Ai determine how you write code with your new helper. Big Tech f'd up a lot of things the last 25 years as we ceded control of our interfaces to them. I don't want to make the same mistake with my primary work tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, getting into the guts of how agents work and messing around with the knobs and levers is super interesting and where the real differentiating skills are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few games developed entirely with AI. I'm using GitHub CoPilot to drive the development, and I'm having the AI come up with the graphics programmatically as well. It's a pretty fun project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just released the browser extension for https://unrav.io . It transforms any article, paper, or YouTube video into your perfect view (infographic, TL;DR, mind map, podcast, etc) with one click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s for people who feel smart but overwhelmed, drowning in tabs, skimming everything, remembering nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need more information. You need clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got so sick of not being able to find good driving routes that I'm working on https://shuto.app but also because Waze wants but to cut through London for my current contract gigs rather than take the M25 sensibly I'm also working on having the algo handle that for default. Testers would be appreciated if you ping me below though at anosh@ below link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• I've never been satisfied with music players on iOS, so I'm making the definitive one. It works with every personal media server, in additional to local files and Apple Music libraries. It'll do some stuff that no music player has ever done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• I open-sourced and released some iOS dev tooling I built for Claude Code that multiplied my personal coding productivity: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264591 Nobody cares yet, but it makes me feel good to share something cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a simple IoT visualizer. I built my own domotic system at home (which i hope to turn into a product at some point) and I had the need to visualize the sensor data per room and per floor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I was working on the tablet interface (in Godot Engine) I put Claude to work on what after two minutes became a full product on its own with a new file format as well. Tell me what you think! (so far the response is meh...)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a netsuite competitor (having spent a lot of my career on accounting and erp implementations.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trick (one trick) is to allow LLMs to provide an audit/accounting/compliance playbook, along with customizations, based on the user describing their business model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hacking GTA V’s graphics pipeline to get access to the depth buffer, so I can feed it into a self-driving machine learning model. There’s already tools that do this (ReShade &amp;amp; other DX11 hooks) but I want to learn how to do this in general for other types of data &amp;amp; processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I’ve been trying to lean into my fears more. Disassembling binary was always something I knew would be helpful to know but I kind of avoided, so I think this is helps with that a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am hunting for the source code of VR-1 Crossroads&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a mud style game in beta that ended up getting axed in the early 2000s (?) but it was brilliant and a few of us stuck around in it long after we should have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone has heard anything about it, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://deepwalker.xyz - Mobile Agent, can bypass cloudflare,sms,email validations and some captchas. You just need a cheap android phone and plug into your computer. Deepwalker takes care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: You don't need to install anything...This tech is awesome bro!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building personal, minimalist, website monitor in Gleam using the Erlang OTP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the time-honored hacker tradition of added more problems to the problem i'm trying to solve I'm learning a new language (never done FP before, either), building the product I wanted, using the latest crop of creative tools, and treating it as a little end-to-end business startup too. Launching in January!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am trying to make a game that sits squarely between AE2 style request-based on-demand crafting VS fully passive production akin to Factorio :) Making games is fun!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just finished a major (v0.10) revamp of the API (you can use connet as part of an application, not through the CLI) which also fixed a few issues I've been seeing before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I'm gearing to update the relay protocols - currently relays are closed off by the control server (e.g. you ask it to provision you a relay resource) which requires the relay to communicate with the control server itself. In the new version, the relays will be operating on their own (there might be a shared secret with the control server, in case you want a closed off relay) and peers will reserve directly with the desired relays. Maybe in future, the relays might form clusters on their own to take advantage of better relay-to-relay network and peers will reserve only at the relay closest to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another stream of work, is giving peers identities. Right now the server will give them an internal identity to better support reconnects, but these are not stable (e.g. they don't survive client restarts). In future, the peer will advertise their identity and then other peers may choose what peers to allow comms with and what to ignore, pushing more decisions into peers themself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet another change I'm thinking about is exposing raw endpoints to enable users of the system to implements other protocols - I'm not quite sure if this is really needed (the destination/source, e.g. server/client) covers a lot of ground by itself, but it would be great if these are not the only options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many options how to continue, but if I'm out of ideas, there is always a Rust rewrite to throw in /s&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, I realized that I've used `/s` incorrectly. I've been thinking about rewriting the clients in Rust, mostly to allow simpler embedding in other languages - java and swift for example (I think it would be great if connet was available on mobile - for android you can Termux to compile/run it, but it is a pain). This will make it harder to embed in golang tho.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another option is to try to rewrite clients in each of the language, but most fare poorly on QUIC support - in Java for example, I'm not aware of one that is advertised as production ready (looking at kwik with their fork of TLS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;hashcards is a local-first spaced repetition app, along the lines of Anki or Mochi. Like Anki, it uses FSRS, the most advanced scheduling algorithm yet, to schedule reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing that makes hashcards unique: it doesn’t use a database. Rather, your flashcard collection is just a directory of Markdown files, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Cards/
  Math.md
  Chemistry.md
  Astronomy.md
  ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And each file, or “deck”, looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Q: What is the role of synaptic vesicles?
A: They store neurotransmitters for release at the synaptic terminal.

Q: What is a neurite?
A: A projection from a neuron: either an axon or a dendrite.

C: Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.

C: Speech is [understood] in [Wernicke's] area.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You write flashcards more or less like you’d write ordinary notes, with lightweight markup to denote basic (question/answer) flashcards and cloze deletion flashcards. Then, to study, you run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ hashcards drill &amp;lt;path to the cards directory&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This opens a web interface on &lt;code&gt;localhost:8000&lt;/code&gt;, where you can review the
flashcards. Your performance and review history is stored in an SQLite
database in the same directory as the cards. Cards are content-addressed, that
is, identified by the hash of their text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This central design decision yields many benefits: you can edit your flashcards with your editor of choice, store your flashcard collection in a Git repo, track its changes, share it on GitHub with others (as I have). You can use scripts to generate flashcards from some source of structured data (e.g. a CSV of English/French vocabulary pairs). You can query and manipulate your collection using standard Unix tools, or programmatically, without having to dig into the internals of some app’s database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why build a new spaced repetition app? Mostly because I was dissatisfied with both Anki and Mochi. But also, additionally, because my flashcards collection is very important to me, and having it exist either in some remote database, or as an opaque unusable data blob on my computer, doesn’t feel good. “Markdown files in a Git repo” gives me a level of ownership that other approaches lack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of this post explains my frustrations with Anki and Mochi, and how I landed on the design decisions for hashcards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Anki&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anki was the first SR system I used. It’s open source, so it will be around forever; it has a million plugins; it was the first SR system to use FSRS for scheduling. It has really rich stats, which I think are mostly useless but are fun to look at. And the note types feature is really good: it lets you generate a large number of flashcards automatically from structured data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The central problem with Anki is that the interface is really bad. This manifests in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, it is ugly to look at, particularly the review screen. And this diminishes your enjoyment of what is already an often boring and frustrating process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, doing simple things is hard. A nice feature of Mochi is that when you start the app you go right into review mode. You’re drilling flashcards before you even realize it. Anki doesn’t have a “study all cards due today”, rather, you have to manually go into a deck and click the “Study Now” button. So what I would do is put all my decks under a “Root” deck, and study that. But this is a hack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, third: card input uses WYSIWYG editing. So, you’re either jumping from the keyboard to the mouse (which increases latency, and makes flashcard creation more frustrating) or you have to remember all these keybindings to do basic things like “make this text a cloze deletion” or “make this TeX math”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, plugins are a double-edged sword. Because having the option to use them is nice, but the experience of actually using most plugins is bad. The whole setup feels janky, like a house of cards. Most of the time, if a feature is not built into the app itself, I would rather live without it than use a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mochi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mochi feels like it was built to address the main complaint about Anki: the interface. It is intuitive, good looking, shortcut-rich. No jank. Instead of WYSIWYG, card text is Markdown: this is delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a few problems. While Markdown is a very low-friction way to write flashcards, cloze deletions in Mochi are very verbose. In hashcards, you can write this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Speech is [produced] in [Broca's] area.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The equivalent in Mochi is this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Speech is {{1::produced}} in {{2::Broca's}} area.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot of typing. And you might object that it’s only a few characters longer. But when you’re studying from a textbook, or when you’re copying words from a vocabulary table, these small frictions add up. If writing flashcards is frustrating, you’ll write fewer of them: and that means less knowledge gained. Dually, a system that makes flashcard creation as frictionless as possible means more flashcards, and more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another problem is that Mochi doesn’t have an equivalent of Anki’s note types. For example: you can make a note type for chemical elements, with fields like atomic number, symbol, name, etc., and write templates to generate flashcards asking questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What is the atomic number of [name]?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What element has atomic number [number]?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What is the symbol for [name]?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What element has symbol [symbol]?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so on for other properties. This is good. Automation is good. Less work, more flashcards. Mochi doesn’t have this feature. It has templates, but these are not as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the biggest problem with Mochi, I think, is the algorithm. Until very recently, when they added beta support for FSRS, the algorithm used by Mochi was even simpler than SM-2. It was based on multipliers: remembering a card multiplies its interval by a number &amp;gt;1, forgetting a card multiplies its interval by a number between 0 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The supposed rationale for this is simplicity: the user can reason about the algorithm more easily. But I think this is pointless. The whole point of an SR app is the software manages the schedule for you, and the user is completely unaware of how the scheduler works. The optimality is to have the most advanced possible scheduling algorithm (meaning the one that yields the most recall for the least review time) under the most intuitive interface possible, and the user just reaps the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously without an RCT we can’t compare Mochi/SM-2/FSRS, but my subjective experience of it is that the algorithm works well for the short-term, and falters on the long-term. It’s very bad when you forget a mature card: if a card has an interval of sixty days, and you click forget, you don’t reset the interval to one day (which is good, because it helps you reconsolidate the lost knowledge). Rather, the interval is multiplied by the forget multiplier (by default: 0.5) down to thirty days. What’s the use? If I forgot something after sixty days, I surely won’t have better recall in thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can fix this by setting the forget multiplier to zero. But you have to know this is how it works, and, crucially: I don’t want to configure things! I don’t want “scheduler parameter finetuning” to be yet another skill I have to acquire: I want the scheduler to just work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, I think spaced repetition algorithms are too optimistic. I’d rather see cards slightly more often, and spend more time reviewing things, than get stuck in “forgetting hell”. But developers have to worry that making the system too burdensome will hurt retention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Anki, it’s the interface that’s frustrating, but the algorithm works marvelously. In Mochi, the interface is delightful, but it’s the algorithm that’s frustrating. Because you can spend months and months drilling flashcards, building up your collection, but when the cards cross some invisible age threshold, you start to forget them, and the algorithm does not help you relearn things you have forgotten. Eventually I burned out on it and stopped doing my reviews, because I expected to forget everything eventually anyhow. And now they added support for FSRS, but by now I have 1700 cards overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally: Mochi has only two buttons, “Forgot” and “Remembered”. This is simpler for the user, yes, but most SR scheduling algorithms have more options for a reason: different degrees of recall adjust the card parameters by different magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Hashcards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do I want from a spaced repetition system?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing is: card creation must be frictionless. I have learned that the biggest bottleneck in spaced repetition, for me, is not doing the reviews (I am very disciplined about this and have done SR reviews daily for months on end), it’s not even converting conceptual knowledge into flashcards, the biggest bottleneck is just entering cards into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The surest way to shore up your knowledge of some concept or topic is to write more flashcards about it: asking the same question in different ways, in different directions, from different angles. More volume means you see the same information more often, asking in different ways prevents “memorizing the shape of the card”, and it acts as a kind of redundancy: there are multiple edges connecting that bit of knowledge to the rest of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there have been many times where I have thought: I would make this more solid by writing another flashcard. But I opted not to because the marginal flashcard is too effortful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If getting cards into the system involves a lot of friction, you write fewer cards. And there’s an opportunity cost: the card you don’t write is a concept you don’t learn. Integrated across time, it’s entire oceans of knowledge which are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So: the system should make card entry effortless. This was the guiding principle behind the design of the hashcards text format. For example, cloze deletions use square brackets because in a US keyboard, square brackets can be typed without pressing shift (compare Mochi’s curly brace). And it’s one bracket, not two. Originally, the format was one line per card, with blank lines separating flashcards, and question-answer cards used slashes to separate the sides, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;What is the atomic number of carbon? / 6

The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is strictly less friction. But it creates a problem for multi-line flashcards, which are common enough that they should not be a second-class citizen. Eventually, I settled on the current format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Q: What is the atomic number of carbon?
A: 6

C: The atomic number of [carbon] is [6].
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is only slightly more typing, and has the benefit that you can easily visually identify where a card begins and ends, and what kind of card it is. I spent a lot of time arguing back and forth with Claude about what the optimal format should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another source of friction is not creating the cards but editing them. The central problem is that your knowledge changes and improves over time. Often textbooks take this approach where Chapter 1 introduces one kind of ontology, and by Chapter 3 they tell you, “actually that was a lie, here’s the real ontology of this subject”, and then you have to go back and edit the old flashcards to match. Because otherwise you have one card asking, e.g., for the undergraduate definition of some concept, while another asks you for the graduate-level definition, creating ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, when studying from a textbook, I create a deck for the textbook, with sub-decks for each chapter. That makes it easy to match the flashcards to their source material (to ensure they are aligned) and each chapter deck only has a few tens of cards usually, keeping them navigable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you wrote multiple cards for the same concept, so you have to update them all at once. Finding the related ones can be hard if the deck is large. In hashcards, a deck is just a Markdown file. The cards immediately above and below a card are usually semantically related. You just scroll up and down and make the edits in place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why plain-text files in a Git repo? Why not use the above format, but in a “normal” app with a database?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vague idea of a spaced repetition system where flashcards are stored as plain-text files in a Git repo had been kicking around my cranium for a long time. I remember asking an Ankihead on IRC circa 2011 if such a thing existed. At some point I read Andy Matuschak’s note on his implementation of an SR system. In his system, the flashcards are colocated with prose notes. The notation is similar to mine: &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; tags for
question-answer cards, and &lt;code&gt;{curly braces}&lt;/code&gt; for cloze deletions. And the cards
are content-addressed: identified by their hash. Which is an obviously good
idea. But his code is private and, besides, I feel that prose notes and
flashcards are very different beasts, and I don’t need or want them to mix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think the idea of plain-text spaced repetition got bumped up the priority queue because I spontaneously started using a workflow that was similar to my current hashcards workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When studying from a textbook or a website, I’d write flashcards in a Markdown file. Usually, I used a shorthand like &lt;code&gt;[foo]&lt;/code&gt; for cloze deletions. Then I’d use
a Python script to transform the shorthand into the &lt;code&gt;{{1::foo}}&lt;/code&gt; notation used by Mochi. And I’d edit the flashcards in the file, as
my knowledge built up and my sense of what was relevant and important to
remember improved. And then, when I was done with the chapter or document or
whatever, only then, I would manually import the flashcards into Mochi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it struck me that the last step was kind of unnecessary. I was already writing my flashcards as lightly-annotated Markdown in plain-text files. I had already implemented FSRS out of curiosity. I was looking for a personal project to build during funemployment. So hashcards was by then a very neatly-shaped hole that I just needed to paint inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that using plain-text storage has many synergies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can edit the cards using whatever editor you use, build up a library of card-creating macros, and navigate the collection using the editor’s file browser.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can query and update the collection using standard Unix tools, or a programming language, e.g. using &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;to get the total number of words in the collection, or using&lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;to make a bulk-update to a set of cards.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can use Git for version control. Git is infinitely more featureful than the change-tracking of any SR app: you can edit multiple cards in one commit, branch, merge, use pull requests, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can make your flashcards public on GitHub. I often wish people put more of themselves out there: their blog posts, their dotfiles, their study notes. And why not their flashcards? Even if they are not useful to someone else, there is something enjoyable about reading what someone else finds interesting, or enjoyable, or worth learning.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can generate flashcards using scripts (e.g., turn a CSV of foreign language vocabulary into a deck of flashcards), and write a Makefile to tie the script, data source, and target together. I do this in my personal deck. Anki’s note types don’t have to be built into hashcards, rather, you can DIY it using some Python and make.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is a system where creating and editing flashcards is nearly frictionless, that uses an advanced spaced repetition scheduler, and which provides an elegant UI for drilling flashcards. I hope others will find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Adafruit: Arduino’s Rules Are ‘Incompatible With Open Source’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The open source hardware community is debating Arduino’s new Terms and Conditions following the company’s acquisition by Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief microcontroller rival Adafruit has argued that the new terms threaten open principles by restricting reverse engineering of cloud tools, asserting perpetual licenses over user uploads and implementing broad monitoring for AI-related features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino has defended the changes, claiming restrictions only apply to its SaaS cloud applications, that data handling is standard for modern platforms, and its commitment to open source hardware remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Debate Over Arduino’s New Terms and Conditions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I spoke to Arduino, Adafruit and the EFF about Qualcomm’s October acquisition of the beloved company known for its single-board microcontroller kits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many criticisms came from rival Adafruit, whose products include Arduino-compatible hardware kits. In late November, Adafruit’s Managing Editor Phillip Torrone had warned its 36,000+ followers on LinkedIn that (among other things) Arduino’s users were now “explicitly forbidden from reverse engineering or even attempting to understand how the platform works unless Arduino gives permission.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Arduino responded in a blog post that “Restrictions on reverse engineering apply specifically to our Software-as-a-Service cloud applications. Anything that was open, stays open.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Arduino spokesperson said their blog post reassured many readers, who’d said they felt “understanding and relief that our commitment to the open source spirit is unwavering and Arduino’s core mission remains unchanged.” Yet Adafruit’s critical LinkedIn post had drawn over 1,575 upvotes. I asked both sides to clarify their positions. Does this really represent a turning point since Arduino’s founding in 2004?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what they had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reverse Engineering: Cloud Apps vs. Hardware Boards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked Mitch Stoltz, EFF director for competition and IP litigation, who agreed that Arduino “isn’t imposing any new bans on tinkering with or reverse engineering Arduino boards.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Adafruit, Arduino’s primary user base is at-home enthusiasts. Arduino provides an open source electronics platform — which includes single-board microcontrollers such as the Arduino UNO — and various kits/shields/accessories, as well as development software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Adafruit founder Limor “Ladyada” Fried says Arduino’s response “downplays how central the cloud and web tools have become to the Arduino experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you go to the Arduino software page and the cloud page, you’re strongly encouraged to use the cloud editor/web IDE and cloud plans, especially on platforms like ChromeOS where the cloud editor is the recommended or only realistic path,” Fried said. “So when Arduino says ‘These restrictions only apply to SaaS,’ that still means the restrictions apply to the tools many new users are being steered into as their primary Arduino environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“On top of that, using those cloud tools generally requires an Arduino account, and the signup flow prominently presents marketing and profiling consents, including consent to processing personal data for commercial offers and to profiling for customized offers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That is a very different model than ‘download a local IDE and just start hacking on hardware,'” Fried said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Even if the underlying firmware and libraries remain open source, the practical entry point for many users is moving”, she pointed out, in that accounts are tied to personal data, marketing and profiling prompts have been introduced, and are being linked to centralized, subscription-oriented cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understanding the License on User-Uploaded Content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adafruit’s Torrone had also said Arduino’s new documents “introduce an irrevocable, perpetual license over anything users upload.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Arduino argues they’re instead clarifying that “content you choose to publish on the Arduino platform remains yours, and can be used to enable features you’ve requested, such as cloud services and collaboration tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview, an Arduino spokesperson provided clarifying examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“If a user uploads their code sketches on their Arduino Cloud subscription, the content remains their own, private to them, and the licensing rights granted to Arduino are strictly functional to perform the requested features (e.g. compiling the sketch in the cloud).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“If the user uploads code or content to Project Hub or to the Forum, where the content is visible to all other users, then Arduino requires the user, who retains the ownership of the content, to grant a license to handle the publication.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“[W]ithout this license, we could not run user projects on the cloud or display their posts in the forum, which is why this type of license is typically required to run any modern cloud service or social platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino’s old terms of use had also required a license for using material posted, notes EFF’s Stoltz, which he says is “normal for any online platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then Stoltz adds that “Still, some of the changes to the terms are troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino’s old terms “were unusual in giving users the ability to revoke that license at any time. The new terms remove that ability, making the license irrevocable. It’s disappointing to see a platform that was once especially user-protective revert to the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;User Data and the Right To Delete Accounts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino also pointed out an additional privacy protection. “All users retain the right to request deletion of their account and/or content at any time. Upon such deletion, the relevant content will no longer be visible to other users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torrone had complained of “years-long retention of usernames even after account deletion,” but Arduino calls that “a misunderstanding of our policy … When a user requests account deletion, we immediately delete the account and remove the user’s username from all associated Forum posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The five-year public retention of usernames applies only to users who simply have not logged into their Arduino user account for 24 months and have not submitted any data or account deletion requests.” (In those cases, Arduino seeks a status where “contributions remain attributed to inactive usernames, honoring their contribution to the community.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for those inactive-for-two-years users, accounts are automatically deactivated, Arduino’s blog post clarified, but with usernames preserved in the Arduino Forum “to address an explicit request from the Forum community to maintain attribution for user-generated content.” (And where a user does request account deletion, “the username would be promptly removed and related posts would become anonymous.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even then, with those inactive accounts, “After five years the username is deleted,” Arduino’s spokesperson explained, “and relevant user posts or comments are de-identified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This policy is not meant for data retention for commercial use, but instead solely to help preserve content attribution, something the community has emphasized as valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Adafruit’s Fried still says there’s a troubling pattern in how usernames are retained and not deleted. “Policy choices that treat the community’s identity and data as a managed asset, rather than something users can fully control.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI Features and User Monitoring Policies on Arduino&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The culture difference is most clear where the new Terms and Conditions list several “prohibited uses of AI,” which include criminal use and violation of the law, intentions to harm (including dissemination of false information and manipulative or deceptive acts), generating facial recognition databases and military use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino’s blog post notes its new AI features are optional — including AI-powered computer vision and audio models and an IDE with pre-trained AI models. But in the new Terms and Conditions, Arduino “reserves the right to monitor User accounts and use of the AI Product … [for] verifying compliance with laws and this policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arduino says the monitoring is “to comply with existing laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws, export controls, and other global regulatory requirements” and “verify compliance with legal and policy standards.” And they add their ultimate goal is “protecting the users and Arduino” and to enable “robust and reliable operation of the AI products.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But their conditions also include the right to monitor for other reasons, including “administering and managing Arduino’s business.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adafruit’s Fried says Arduino “should, of course, comply with applicable laws and respond appropriately to clear evidence of criminal activity.” But “they should design their AI and cloud offerings so that monitoring is narrowly targeted, proportionate, and clearly explained, instead of defaulting to broad surveillance across all users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“You cannot say ‘this code is open source, but it may not be used for military purposes’ and still call the license open source.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;— Adafruit Founder Limor Fried&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fried instead sees “an ongoing surveillance posture, not just responding to specific, well-founded reports of abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, an open source application can watch for the creation of facial-recognition databases or military use “as long as they are transparent about what they log, how long they keep it, and under what circumstances they review it.” But there are concerns about “broad continuous monitoring erodes user trust, especially in an educational/maker context where many people are minors or hobbyists who expect a relatively private environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there’s an even larger issue of principle. “Genuine open source licenses do not allow field-of-use restrictions,” Fried said. “You cannot say ‘this code is open source, but it may not be used for military purposes’ and still call the license open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you present something as open source, you no longer get to pick and choose ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ users.” Fried calls such restrictions “fundamentally incompatible with open source licensing,” and would like to see Arduino remove them. “If a project wants that kind of control, it should be honest and call itself ‘source-available’ or something similar, not open source.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torrone noted that Arduino’s Terms and Conditions also state users will undertake not to use Arduino’s platform or services “to identify or provide evidence to support any potential patent infringement claim against Arduino … or any of Arduino’s or Arduino’s Affiliates’ suppliers and/or direct or indirect customers.” But the specifics almost seem beside the point. Fried says Arduino’s usage restrictions “effectively override the freedoms the license is supposed to guarantee.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s Next for Arduino and the Open Source Community?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Transparency and open dialogue are fundamental to the Arduino ethos,” its spokesperson said Friday, “and understanding the community’s concerns, we are eager to set the record straight and reaffirm our commitment to the open source community.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The representative also added that “We are committed to continuing to listen to community feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what will Adafruit do next? Fried said Friday that Adafruit isn’t changing, and would “keep designing and shipping open source hardware, with hardware, firmware, and software available so people can learn from it, modify it, and build on it.” And the company supports “multiple” ecosystems, also continuing work on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) chips, matter-based Internet of Things (IoT), and the Linux Foundation’s real-time OS Zephyr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are always open to working with other makers and companies, including Arduino, as long as the collaboration allows us to ship great products with strong documentation and truly open source licensing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;JSDoc *is* TypeScript&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May of 2023 an internal refactoring PR from the Svelte repo made it to the front page of the Hacker News forums. The (superficially) controversial PR seemingly vindicated TypeScript skeptics/luddites (which at the time included figures like Dan Abramov of the React team). The premier darling of web frameworks ostensibly rejecting the benefits of static typing was a big deal.1 So Rich Harris felt compelled to hop onto HN and explain how this was "not a vindication of anti-Typescript positions".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harris offered a considered take on why moving type declarations from .ts files to JSDoc comments in .js files was not an anti-TypeScript take. In fact, Harris asserted that Svelte's "commitment to TypeScript [was] stronger than ever."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This event heralded (and served as a citation for) a flood of "TypeScript VS JSDoc" blog posts and forum threads that offered the somewhat novel defense of JSDoc as "all the benefits of TypeScript without the build step" (albeit with a sometimes clunkier syntax).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is not the blog post lineage I hope to draw on with this post. Instead, I'd like to focus on a larger and more often misunderstood point. I take issue with the "vs" framing and offer a subtle but crucial substitution: JSDoc is TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some background:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TypeScript is C#?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the late aughts/early 10s, JavaScript was still mostly seen as an unserious language. The tooling for JavaScript development lacked autocomplete, rename symbol, type safety, etc. Microsoft developers were so allergic to it that they would write C# code and use a tool called ScriptSharp to generate slightly-more-typesafe JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the origins of TypeScript.2 It is, fundamentally, a build tool to make writing JS less crappy. In fact:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TypeScript is IntelliSense!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you don't write your code in .ts files, you're probably using TypeScript. That's because TypeScript is the IntelliSense engine. Even if you're not using VSCode, if your editor gives you code completion, parameter info, quick info, member lists, etc. while writing JS code, you are almost certainly running the TypeScript language service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TypeScript is JSDoc :)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also the TypeScript language service that is used to interpret JSDoc comments. That is why the TypeScript CHANGELOG often includes notes about JSDoc features.3 It also the reason your JSDoc-related IntelliSense can be governed by a &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file and you can run &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; on a project typed with JSDoc comments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are already using TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Own Experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently rewrote the front-end for an old project of mine completely typed with JSDoc comments and I wanted to share some of my takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Besides runtime features like enums, basically everything you can express in TypeScript you can express in JSDoc. Certain features like generics are much clunkier, forcing you to type the return in order to infer generic slots. But sometimes the clunkier syntax can actually encourage better TypeScript practices by pushing devs to rely more on type inference.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For packages typed with JSDoc, CTRL/CMD clicking on a function will take you to actual code rather than a type declarations file. I much prefer this experience as a dev.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript tooling is surprisingly reusable for JSDoc projects. This includes type generation libraries that take schemas (e.g. OpenApi or GraphQL) defined in your backend and generate corresponding types in your front-end. I found that most of these can be set up to generate types in JSDoc comments instead of TypeScript code.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take it from a massive TypeScript nerd: JSDoc is not an anti-TypeScript position to take. It is the same powerful static analysis without the build step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EDIT: This got some discussion on HN and I've learned that webpack has also migrated to JSDoc↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the reason enums were, regrettably, added to the language↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A miserable sidenote: becoming a TypeScript expert means accepting that half of the TypeScript documentation is in the changelog. E.g.↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Richard P. Feynman&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The Problem of Teaching Physics in Latin America" is a transcript of the keynote speech given by Richard Feynman at the First Inter‑American Conference on Physics Education in Rio de Janeiro in June 1963. Dr. Feynman is Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem of teaching physics in Latin America is only part of the wider problem of teaching physics anywhere. In fact, it is part of the problem of teaching anything anywhere – a problem for which there is no known satisfactory solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many new plans in many countries for trying to teach physics, which shows that nobody is satisfied with any method. It is likely that many of the new plans look good, for nobody has tried them long enough to find out what is the matter with them; whereas all the old methods have been with us long enough to show their faults clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact is that nobody knows very well how to tell anybody else how to teach. So when we try to figure out how to teach physics we must he somewhat modest, because nobody really knows how. It is at the same time a serious problem and an opportunity for new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem of teaching physics in Latin America can also be generalized in another way, to remind us of the problem of doing anything in Latin America. We must get at least partly involved in the special social, political, and economic problems that exist here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the problems come into sharper focus if there is before us a clear picture of the reasons for teaching physics in the first place. So I will try to give some reasons why I believe we should teach physics. We can then ask whether any particular educational plan is in fact satisfying any of the reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first reason is, of course, that physics is a basic science, and as such is used in engineering, chemistry, and biology, and has all kinds of applications in technology. Physics is the science, or knowledge of nature, that tells us how things work. In particular, I am stressing here how devices of various kinds – invented by men in present and forthcoming technology – work. Therefore, those who know physics will be much more useful in coping with the technical problems arising in local industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be argued, and in practice it is argued, that in the earlier stages of industrial development that we have in Latin America, such talent is completely superfluous because it is so easy to import good technically‑trained personnel from more advanced countries outside. Therefore, is it really necessary to develop highly‑technically‑trained people locally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I probably do not know enough economics to answer correctly, but I will try to give an opinion anyway. I think it is vitally important to improve the technical ability of the peoples of Latin America. By education, the man with higher technical ability is able to produce more, and I believe that in the improvement of the technical ability, and thus the productivity, of the people of Latin America lies the source of real economic advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not economically sound to continuously import technically‑skilled people. If Latin American people were educated technically they would find positions in the developing industries here; it would soon be realized by the people who now import such workers that there is a supply of really able men in this country, and that this local supply has many advantages. The local people would not demand such high wages, would know the customs and ways of the country, and would be glad to take more permanent positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is true that Latin Americans with the same degrees in science or engineering as their foreign counterparts seem to be very much less able. This (as I shall explain) is because they have not really been taught any science. This experience has probably conditioned industrialists to pay very little attention to the local universities and scientists. If they were wise the industrialists would see the problem quite the other way around and would be the first to clamor for a meeting of the kind we are having today, to find out what is the matter with the local product and how to teach physics in a really satisfactory manner in their countries. Yet none of them are here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A secondary reason for teaching physics, or any experimental science, is that it incidentally teaches how to do things with your hands. It teaches many techniques for manipulating things – as well as techniques of measurement and calculation, for example – which have very much wider applications than the particular field of study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another major reason for teaching physics is for the science itself. Science is an activity of men; to many men it is a great pleasure and it should not be denied to the people of a large part of the world simply because of a fault or lack in the educational system. In other words, one of the reasons for teaching science is to make scientists who will not just contribute to the development of industry but also contribute to the development of knowledge, joining others in this great adventure of our times, and, of course, obtaining enormous pleasure in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there is good reason to study nature to appreciate its wonder and its beauty, even though one may not become an actively‑working professional scientist. This knowledge of nature also gives a feeling of stability and reality about the world and drives out many fears and superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fourth value in teaching science is to teach how things are found out. The value of questioning, the value of free ideas – not only for the development of science, but the value of free ideas in every field – becomes apparent. Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known (for nothing is known absolutely), how to handle doubt and uncertainty, what the rules of evidence are, how to think about things so that judgments can be made, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show. These are certainly important secondary yields of teaching science, and physics in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in learning science you learn to handle trial and error, to develop a spirit of invention and of free inquiry which is of tremendous value far beyond science. One learns to ask oneself: "Is there a better way to do it?" (And the answer to this is not the conditioned reflex: "Let's see how they do it in the United States," because there must certainly be a better way than that!) We must try to think of some new gimmick or idea, to find some improvement in the technique. This question is the source of a great deal of free independent thought, of invention, and of human progress of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ends my list of reasons for the teaching of physics as a science. Let me turn now to a description of some of the major characteristics of science education in Latin America which appear to me to be of special concern for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, and most serious, I believe, is the almost exclusive teaching and learning by means of pure abject memory. This in no way teaches physics as a science. Nothing is understood; it is only remembered. This in no way satisfies the reasons I outlined for teaching science. Memorization of laws does not permit one to make applications of these laws to new situations; it does not permit one the pleasure of ultimately making scientific contributions; it cannot teach any techniques with the hands. From memorizing, knowledge is not understood, and the beauty of nature is not appreciated. It does not tell how things were found out, or reveal the value of an inventive free mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the telescope is an interesting device to make, understand, look through, and play with. It turned men's ideas and minds in new directions. It gave a great impetus to the modern revolution of thought. For a long while it was the sole revealer of the vastness of the heavens and man's modest place in it. But, in Latin America one learns that there are four kinds of telescopes: the Newtonian, the Cassigranian, etc., etc. In the first, the image is virtual and inverted, etc. (I put in all this "etc." because I really don't know how many kinds of telescopes there are, or what their names are, or which way the image is in each kind. But don't underestimate me; I know a very great deal about telescopes – how they work, how to make and use one, their powers and limitations, etc.) The result is that the telescope is lost. There is no more telescope, no lenses, no stars, no eyes, no light – just words memorized without requiring understanding. The examination is passed, for the question was "What are the four types of telescopes?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must say immediately that I am not against memorizing. Some things, even many (though nothing special) may be learned by heart; for example, it is good, but not essential, to know by heart 7 x 8 = 56. What I oppose in any teaching philosophy is that the philosophy is used exclusively; but in this case it is especially serious because so little is left of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was incomprehensible to the people of my country when I reported how material is memorized in Latin America completely without understanding. Lectures are dictated so slowly that students can copy them word for word into their notebooks – and sentences are even repeated so they can check them back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked what Brewster's Law is, advanced students answer in a flash: "Light impinging on a material of index n is 100 percent polarized with the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence if the tangent of the angle of incidence equals the index of refraction."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To these same students I then say, "Look out at the bay from which the sunlight is being reflected. If I look at that reflection through this piece of polaroid and turn it, what will happen?" All I receive are blank stares. No one knows. But I get cries of surprise and delight when they try it and see the reflections getting brighter and dimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shows something is completely wrong. There is no knowledge whatsoever of nature. With the wrong entrance clue the memorization is useless. These students are like books, no more. I can look in the index of a book under "Brewster's Law" and find a reference equivalent to the students' reply. But in the index I cannot find "sun reflecting on bay."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do the students know that is not easily and directly available in a book? The things that can be looked up in a book are only a part of knowledge. Who wants such a student to work in a plant when a book requiring no food or maintenance stands day after day always ready to give just as adequate answers? Who wants to be such a student, to have worked so hard, to have missed so much of interest and pleasure, and to be outdone by an inanimate printed list of "laws"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What experience I have makes me think that this is one of the main failures in the education of students in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second problem in Latin America is that the students are all alone. They cannot converse with other students; they cannot see how stupid some fellow students are. This is mainly for some psychological reason. They do not wish to be found unsure, for they will be ridiculed. They cannot ask questions in class because the others later say, "Why do you waste the time of all of us? Everyone knows that." So, to save face, they all put on a show of knowledge, thereby frustrating free discussion and the exchange of ideas – one of the pleasantest and easiest ways of learning things. There is too much show, and too much formality in the classroom for any exercise of free thought and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third problem is the lack of freedom in the university structure. You cannot move around from one subject to another or from one lab to another. Those who go abroad to learn find it difficult to communicate their new knowledge easily and directly to the university students when they return – for they cannot find a place in, and are not welcomed into, the university structure. For some reason or other, it becomes necessary for such people to create new and separate research institutes. The spirit of excitement in these institutions as their research progresses is not found in the universities, and this is quite unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another problem in Latin America is that there is very little outlet for the students who do not want to become complete scientists. It is not easy for them to obtain jobs in the developing industries here. Perhaps if these students were really adequately trained, the companies would gradually realize their value and this problem would disappear. But some of the enthusiastic students are not geniuses, and there must be some place for them to go – even though they are not going to make any scientific contribution, or become second Einsteins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I began studying at MIT I started in mathematics, and probably I thought I would be a mathematician. Then I discovered that the only use of higher mathematics is to teach more higher mathematics and I turned to something more practical – electrical engineering. Finally I realized I had gone too far in the other direction and chose something in between – physics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was all very easy because, for such closely related subjects, the courses taken by students in each discipline were almost exactly the same and were taught by the same professors. The engineers studied physics taught by the physicists, for instance, and the physicists learned some of their electricity in a course taught by the professors of electrical engineering. It is easy for students to move back and forth among related disciplines. If physics is too difficult for them, or mathematics too abstract, they can turn to engineering and can later expect to find a position somewhere. Such changes are much more difficult in Latin American universities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another characteristic of the situation in Latin America is the small number of people involved: the result is a rapid fluctuation and irregularity in the character of organizations and institutions. How something goes depends very much on particular individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we must mention the problem of the best students leaving to go to other countries. This is because of the lack of opportunities in Latin America, the climate of rigidity that exists in the universities, and the vagaries of fortune of the research institutions as their budgets find uneven support from year to year, from the government and private sources of funds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should now like to give some of the questions for which I think we must seek answers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, how can we free the lower levels of secondary education from the drudge memorization that exists at the present time? It is well known that you can get children quite interested in science in a true, live, and active way while they are young. It is sometimes said you cannot get them interested by the time they are in the university, but this is not true – provided they have not been destroyed as thinking humans at the earlier levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gibbon said: "The power of instruction is of little efficacy, except in those happy dispositions where it is nearly superfluous." This is not really true. It is true of good instruction, but bad instruction can be very efficacious indeed in impressing on one how impossibly dull some subject is. It is possible to destroy the excitement and interest that students may have gained by discovering a small book in the library, by buying a toy, a chemistry set, or a little electric motor – by playing around. In fact, one of the most important sources of motivation of interest in science is in a toy, or in a special book, and from those few teachers who are free enough from the bonds of an educational system to be able to keep children excited and inspired by supplying them with suggestions, demonstrations, and games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a well known experience in education that, in spite of all plans and programs, ultimately almost everything depends on teachers – on individual teachers. You can have poor teachers and, no matter what you try to do with them, the students learn very little. Or you can have good teachers and it doesn't make much difference what you do, provided you leave the teacher free. So I think we must find how to free those few teachers who can be inspiring to children. It is important that those inspiring teachers work along with children, suggesting experiments and trying them freely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second question we shall have to try to answer is how to bring engineers and other applied scientists closer to their real world of application. It is not enough for them to remember exactly how to use the formula, providing that the situation is exactly the same as the situation was in the engineering school when the professor dictated the lecture. We must do something to make the applied engineer more flexible, so that he is effective in a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way may be to have true scientists – and especially active research experimental physicists – teaching physics to some engineering students. Experimental physics generates technical problems. To succeed, you have to work with your hands; you have to meet reality; pure memory won't do. So, people who are good at experimental physics know what engineering problems are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development of industrial technology is in a great measure simply the wider application of techniques which in most cases were developed by scientists trying to do experiments. This is because, in trying to do some experiment in science, you have to push some technique to the extreme. In doing so, you learn how things can be done. Experimental physicists first pursued the problems of how to make a higher vacuum or a lower temperature than ever before, and now high vacuum and low temperatures are tools of industrial technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, experimental science is a source of engineering and experimental science should be taught to engineers in school to keep them aware of the wide range of techniques available and the open possibilities of the future. Perhaps, then, after we have created enough real engineers with real value to industry in Latin America, industry will see that there is no advantage to hiring engineers from overseas and will want more of the locally-trained men and will support the schools with methods of teaching which produce such engineers. Then we will have the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I understand that the number of engineering schools in Latin America is growing rapidly. For example, in Brazil there are twice as many engineering schools as there were ten years ago. If this is the case, then maybe the problem can solve itself. If these schools are not all organized under the same system, if there is a variety in the schools, then one or another school may develop a way to produce excellent students – if the secondary school preparation has not first ruined them. Then this school will acquire a reputation, children will try to go there, other schools will try to compete and copy the better methods‑and so on until the problem solves itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third problem that we have here is how to encourage the true research workers and keep them from leaving home permanently. We have to supply them with books, with experimental equipment, with money for visits abroad, and with a coterie of active interested students. No, excuse me – the coterie will form automatically if the researcher is good and can get to students in any way at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is imperative to encourage the true research worker who is making contributions to science to make his home base in his own country. This should not be hard because there are strong feelings of patriotism in these men; they know they have a great deal to give their country and want to give it. The difficulty is the terrible problems they have at home. For example, the physics research center in Rio, which is one of the leading ones in Latin America, has become isolated from the rest of the world because of a very simple thing: Nobody wants to pay for the Physical Review or Nuovo Cimento. Nobody wants to pay for the journals that can keep people informed of what happens somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This, along with the fact that salaries are absurdly low, shows a lack of interest by the Brazilian government, people, and industry, in the development of science in this country. It is an attitude that does not respect or understand the value of these men. These creating scientists should have a dignity and a power to control their own destiny, and that of science and of science education in their countries. It will be in safe, loving hands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is from the fountain of research workers who understand what science is really about that the true spirit of inquiry rains onto their students, and their students' students, and ultimately, if things are organized right, permeates the entire educational system and speeds the technical development of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fourth problem, then, is how to get these research workers back into the universities where they belong. Then the "rain" will have a far easier and direct passage to the students, the new scientists of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should like to emphasize, by addressing my fifth and final question to the problem, the importance of doing any of these things in a steady, consistent, continuous, and modest way. It should not be done with a big show, the big money, with much advertising, unsupported in the future by any effective maintenance. Maintenance is lacking in many of these projects, for these things have happened before. Pulses of energy have been liberated, forward steps have been taken, only to slip back for lack of continued support. It is necessary to keep up anything that works out. It is necessary to provide a continuous, consistent, perpetual support and to make things more modest so that continuity of support can be maintained. A research group becomes world famous only after years of fruitful research. One year of no support and people drift away and there is nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate that this is a problem of great difficulty and seriousness because it involves so closely all of the social and economic circumstances in the country, and the difficulties are often (but not always) merely the reflection of the vastly more serious problems of the varying fortune of the country as a whole. Yet we ought to discuss it further here. We might try to see if there are ways to work out a scheme so that the educational system, or at least such critical parts of it as research scientists or especially good teachers, is partially independent of the variations in success of the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it should not be completely supported by government. Perhaps greater efforts to obtain private funds might work. Possibly more reliance on, and contact with, more permanent institutions like religious schools might sustain the continuity of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have discussed the problems as directly. and frankly as possible, as I see them. I don't mean to make any criticism, except in the same spirit as any discussion we shall have later will represent a criticism. For surely we shall not all find everything well with the present situation in physics education in Latin America. If so, we would not have had such a meeting. I have tried to avoid making too many specific active suggestions on how to proceed, because this is our job for the rest of this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2002: Last.fm and Audioscrobbler Herald the Social Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following in Amazon's footsteps, two student projects independently use 'collaborative filtering' to bring recommendations and social networking to online music; soon they will join forces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last.fm circa 2003; via Last.fm Flickr account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we now know as the “social web” — or Web 2.0 — didn’t arrive until around 2004. But the first inklings of it were emerging a couple of years before. As usual, music was the harbinger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last.fm was founded in 2002 by a group of four Austrian and German students from Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication in London. It was fashioned as an internet radio station that allowed a user to build a listening profile and share it with others. The year of its launch, Last.fm won a young talent award at the Europrix, a multimedia awards show based in Vienna. This was how the product was described in a showcase video (embedded below) leading up to the awards ceremony:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“After repeated use, the system builds a listening profile that increasingly reflects the user's preferences. The sum of all profiles is visualized in the ‘Map of Music,’ a presentation of musical connections and genres determined only by the collaborative effort of Last.fm users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the students went up to receive their award, one of them, Thomas Willomitzer, noted the importance of “collaborative filtering” to the Last.fm system. The idea was that the Last.fm algorithm would recommend music you might like, based on your listening history combined with the listening history of other, similar, users. Willomitzer added that this type of algorithm would be familiar to people who used Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a video of the Last.fm founders presenting at Europrix 2002, via Thomas Willomitzer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaborative filtering was a common technique in recommender systems, and its history dated back to before the web — for instance, it was the basis for a 1992 Xerox PARC email system called ‘Tapestry.’ But collaborative filtering really came into its own during the web era, and in particular it was popularised by Amazon. By 2002, Amazon users were familiar with the following message: “Customers who bought items in your Shopping Cart also bought…” There was also a “Your Recommendations” list on the Amazon.com homepage. Both of these features were created using an algorithm that Amazon called “item-to-item collaborative filtering.” As explained in a research paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Rather than matching the user to similar customers, item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the user’s purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon collaborative filtering examples; via research paper by Greg Linden, Brent Smith and Jeremy York, published by the IEEE Computer Society in January-February 2003 edition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key here is that Amazon’s collaborative filtering was done based on the items people bought or rated, not the profiles of its users. This approach was also crucial to how new social web services like Last.fm would develop. The “map of music” that Last.fm created was all about mapping which songs (or genres) were interconnected — so a certain Bob Dylan song might have a strong connection to a certain Joni Mitchell song, based on listener data, and thus the Mitchell song might come up as a recommendation for people who listened to the Dylan song (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Audioscrobbler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By coincidence, another student in the UK was also working on a recommendation system for music in 2002. Audioscrobbler was started as a computer science project by Richard Jones at the University of Southampton. Jones coined the term “audioscrobbling" (later shortened to “scrobbling”) to describe the process of tracking songs that you listen to in order to make a listening profile, which is then used for recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Richard Jones profile on University of Southampton website, 20 March 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an April 2003 interview with his University’s paper, twenty-year old Jones explained how Audioscrobbler worked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Users of the system need to download software on to their computer that monitors what artists they listen to. The data is then collated and a pattern emerges by way of a technique known as ‘collaborative filtering.’ The results are then recorded against a username and can be compared with the listening tastes of other members.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, Jones would team up with the Ravensbourne College students and fold his project into Last.fm, but even in 2002 — when they were independent products — it is striking how similar the two systems were. Both used collaborative filtering to create song recommendations, and both aimed to create a kind of social network based around what users listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Audioscrobbler circa 2003; via Last.fm Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escaping the Broadcast Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key to the emerging social web would be that you discover new content and communities by following other people. For music, the idea was to help you break away from the established broadcast model. At the Europrix event, Last.fm’s Martin Stiksel brought out a 1980s-style transistor radio to illustrate the point. If you want to listen to music on such a device, Stiksel explained, you have to tune the frequency band to find your station. If you don’t like the music playing on that station, you tune the dial to another radio station and try your luck again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The inherent problem with broadcast media is that basically, at the end of the day, it's always somebody else selecting the music for you,” said Stiksel. “So there's always a bunch of editors or programmers that picked the music and put them into into a program for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three Last.fm founders in 2002 with a transister radio, "from the 80s, I believe."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Last.fm, the stream of music you heard was a mix of manual choice and algorithmic selection. You might start with a song already in your online “record collection” (the term Stiksel kept using), or start from another user’s profile. From then on, songs would be chosen for you based on collaborative filtering. If you played a song through, the Last.fm software automatically added it to your own collection. You could also press a “love” button to add it. But if you didn’t like a certain track, you could press a “hate” button (so it wouldn’t get played again), or click the “skip” button to move to the next song. There was also a “change” button to go to a different user profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early Last.fm user interface was, in truth, a bit cluttered with all these different buttons and various search boxes — but over time it would get more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last.fm circa November 2003; via Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stiksel explained that the idea for Last.fm came about when the students asked themselves, “how do you look for something that you don't know?” So in the case of music, how to discover new music when you don’t necessarily know what type of music you’re looking for? The answer, he said, was the social component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Then we figured out that it's the social aspect of music — the best music you always find when you go to your friend's house and he plays you records. And we’re taking this concept into an online environment here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Value of User Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What both Last.fm and Audioscrobbler stumbled onto in 2002 was the collective value of user data in discovering new content — something that Amazon was also taking advantage of at this time. The problem with music, though, was that licensing from record companies was still highly restrictive. The Last.fm founders somewhat glossed over it during their Europrix presentation, but they did admit that “due to legal issues, we're only allowed to play 30 second samples.” Unless you already owned a piece of music, 30 seconds was all you got.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the following year, however, Last.fm had begun turning itself into an "online radio" service, by paying licensing fees to the UK collecting societies PRS (Performing Right Society) and MCPS (Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So pre-Web 2.0, the streaming revolution was only just getting started. But with Last.fm and Audioscrobbler, we at least glimpsed the future of the social web.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Between 13:25 and 14:43 PT today, Claude Opus 4.5 and Sonnet models experienced degraded availability. A network routing misconfiguration caused traffic to backend infrastructure to be dropped, preventing requests from completing. The misconfiguration has been reverted and service is fully restored. We’re conducting a review to improve our detection and prevention of similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthetic DNA and RNA molecules are foundational to a host of next-generation technologies crucial for national security and global well-being, impacting everything from resilient supply chains and advanced materials manufacturing to sustainable agriculture and human health. However, current methods for creating these molecules de novo face significant limitations in terms of scale, complexity, and environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Generative Optogenetics (GO) program seeks to overcome these challenges by pioneering a revolutionary approach: Harnessing the power of light to direct the synthesis of DNA and RNA directly within living cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If successful, this high-risk, high-reward research program promises to revolutionize medicine, agriculture, and manufacturing by enabling a new era of bioprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;John Varley died two days ago on December 10, 2025. A great many will mourn him as a science fiction writer whose work they enjoyed. But this misses his moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970s, Varley exploded into science fiction like a phoenix. His "Eight Worlds" stories were set in a future where hyper-powerful aliens have killed everyone on Earth as a threat to its whales and porpoises and humanity survives everywhere else in the Solar System. Despite this bleak background, the stories were bright and inventive. People change gender on a whim. Wealthy and glorious cities turn to shacks and hovels when their holographic fronts are turned off at night. People bank their memories so that, upon death, they can be restarted with new memories. He wrote so many major stories per year that, in a resurrection of an old pulp-days practice, some had to be published under a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were all dazzled. His work was full of impressive new ideas. And, outside of the Eight Worlds sequence, he wrote things like "In the Hall of the Martian Kings," which resurrected the possibility of intelligent life on Mars after the Mariner probes had apparently disproved that. Or "Air Raid," which made air travel terrifying again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His novel Titan looked to be the opening of a classic trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Briefly--for almost a decade--John Varley seemed to be the new Robert Heinlein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, alas, he went to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hollywood paid him to write, rewrite, and rererewrite a script for Millennium (based on "Air Raid") while five directors came and went. Unsurprisingly, the result pleased nobody--most particularly Varley himself. His novelization of the movie made that abundantly clear. Then, by the man's own testimony, he was paid more and more and more money to write scripts that were never made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After too long an absence, Varley returned to print. He was every bit as good a writer as he'd ever been. But his ideas were no longer new. In his absence, writers like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson had moved the cutting edge along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereafter, Varley was only a very good science fiction writer. It is this person that most of his readers will mourn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will mourn the man who, for a time, seemed to be the resurrection of science fiction, the New Heinlein, the kwisatz haderach of genre. Back then, he set the standard. His were the stories we all wanted to equal and perhaps surpass. He was the reason we read science fiction in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long, long ago, when I was yet unpublished, I found myself talking with Isaac Asimov at I forget which convention, when John Varley cruised by, trailed by enthusiastic fans. Asimov gazed sadly after him and said, "Look at him. A decade ago, everybody was asking, 'Who is John Varley?' A decade from now, everybody will be asking, 'Who is Isaac Asimov?'"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that was John Varley's moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system fonts. Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also being suitable for terminal and programming use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two main variants are unscii-8 (8Ã8 pixels per glyph) and unscii-16 (8Ã16). There are also several alternative styles for unscii-8, as well as an 8x16 "full" variant that incorporates missing Unicode glyphs from Fixedsys Excelsior and GNU Unifont. "unscii-16-full" falls under GPL because of how Unifont is licensed; the other variants are in the Public Domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unscii was created by Viznut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020-03-10, the new Unicode version 13.0 added 214 graphics characters for "legacy computing" (including, among all, the missing PETSCII characters, and a majority of missing Teletext/Videotex characters). Most of these were already included in Unscii 1.x, but now I have been able to give them proper Unicode mappings as well. This is the main reason for the Unscii 2.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Unscii 2.0 fixes errors in some characters, legibility in some others and adds a bunch of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here are some conversions of legacy character set art into Unscii.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amiga ansi: Divine Stylers by Hellbeard, as rendered with unscii-16. Source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PC ansi: Ansi Love by Rad Man, as rendered with unscii-16. Source&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commodore 64 petscii pictures as rendered with unscii-8, using the 256-color xterm palette: I Has Floppy by Redcrab; The First Ball by Dr.TerrorZ; Gary by Mermaid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code package includes a generic bitmap-to-unscii converter. Here's an example of a conversion to unscii-8 using the 256-color xterm palette, without dithering:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HEX and PCF are the only actual bitmapped formats here. HEX is the same simple hexdump format as used by the Unifont project. TTF, OTF and WOFF are vectorized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: Due to format limitations, the PCF versions lack all the characters above U+FFFF! However, all the new graphics characters are provided in the good old PUA range as well. A mapping is in the file uns2uni.tr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-16: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-tall: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-thin: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-alt: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-mcr: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;unscii-8-fantasy: hex pcf ttf otf woff&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years ago, I noticed that Unicode had a bunch of pseudographic characters that could be used to enrichen Ansi art. However, no one seemed to use them. Even MUDs that used the 256-color Xterm palette and had no issues with Unicode still preferred to stick to the blocks available in the MS-DOS codepage 437.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After looking into existing Unicode fonts, the reason became obvious: the implementation of non-CP437 graphics characters was shaky at best. Unicode Consortium doesn't even care how pseudographics are implemented. It was a kind of chicken-and-egg problem: No commonly accepted Unicode graphics font, no Unicode art scene; no art scene, no font support. The idea of an art-compatible Unicode font was born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Unscii, I studied a bunch of classic system fonts and how their characters had been used in Ascii and "extended-Ascii" art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8Ã8 system fonts can be divided in two major categories according to their line thickness: 1-pixel and 2-pixel. 2-pixel-wide lines are used in more prominent classic systems, so I chose it. Also, 2-pixel 8Ã8 system fonts are surprisingly similar to one another which made it easier to choose neutral shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic look of the 8Ã8 variant of Unscii is based on the following systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 8Ã16 variant of Unscii has been mostly derived from the 8Ã8 variant by using a set of transformation principles. When in doubt, the following fonts have been looked at for additional reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, neutral shapes are preferred, unless art, legibility or readability require otherwise: The characters /\XY are connective because of their connetive use in ascii art, and the serifs in iIl are longer than in most classic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever a 8Ã16 shape has not been defined, Unscii falls back to height-doubled 8Ã8.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also studied game fonts and thin-line system fonts. This resulted in the variants unscii-8-thin, unscii-8-mcr and unscii-8-fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When studying legacy character sets, I found literally hundreds of characters without proper Unicode codepoints. These are mapped in the PUA range as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Unicode 13.0, many of these are also available in Unicode, but the PUA mappings are retained for compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding good tree-sitter grammars is hard. In arborium, every grammar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hand-picked grammars, added missing highlight queries, and updated them to the latest tree-sitter. Tree-sitter parsers compiled to WASM need libc symbols (especially a C allocator)—we provide arborium-sysroot which re-exports dlmalloc and other essentials for wasm32-unknown-unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTML — custom elements like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a-k&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of
                        &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span class="keyword"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. More compact markup. No
                        JavaScript required.
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;span&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-at&gt;class&lt;/a-at&gt;="&lt;a-s&gt;keyword&lt;/a-s&gt;"&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;fn&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;span&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;a-k&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;fn&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;a-tg&gt;a-k&lt;/a-tg&gt;&lt;a-p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/a-p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANSI — 24-bit true color for terminal applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;macOS, Linux, Windows — tree-sitter handles generating native crates for these platforms. Just add the dependency and go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly — that one's hard. Compiling Rust to WASM with C code that assumes a standard library is tricky. We provide a sysroot that makes this work, enabling Rust-on-the-frontend scenarios like this demo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlight TOML, shell, and other languages in your rustdoc. Create &lt;code&gt;arborium-header.html&lt;/code&gt;:
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you maintain docs.rs or rustdoc, you could integrate arborium directly! Either merge this PR for native rustdoc support, or use &lt;code&gt;arborium-rustdoc&lt;/code&gt; as a
                                post-processing step:
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It streams through HTML, finds &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre class="language-*"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
                                blocks, and highlights them in-place. Works with rustdoc's theme system.
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting for miette error diagnostics. Beautiful, accurate highlighting in your CLI error messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An incremental static site generator with zero-reload live updates via WASM DOM patching, Sass/SCSS, image processing, font subsetting, and arborium-powered syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing to configure—it just works. Arborium is built in and automatically highlights all code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 96 languages included, each behind a feature flag. Enable only what you need, or use &lt;code&gt;all-languages&lt;/code&gt; for everything.
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each feature flag comment includes the grammar's license, so you always know what you're shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highlighter supports themes for both HTML and ANSI output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bundled themes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code/&gt;

This adds a fixed overhead to every grammar bundle, on top of the grammar-specific parser tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Language&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;C Lines&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Size&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Distribution&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every grammar is compiled to WASM with aggressive size optimizations. Here's the complete build pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compile with nightly Rust using &lt;code&gt;-Zbuild-std&lt;/code&gt; to rebuild the standard library with our optimization flags:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Cpanic=immediate-abort&lt;/code&gt;
                            Skip unwinding machinery
                        &lt;code&gt;-Copt-level=s&lt;/code&gt;
                            Optimize for size, not speed
                        &lt;code&gt;-Clto=fat&lt;/code&gt;
                            Full link-time optimization across all crates
                        &lt;code&gt;-Ccodegen-units=1&lt;/code&gt;
                            Single codegen unit for maximum optimization
                        &lt;code&gt;-Cstrip=symbols&lt;/code&gt;
                            Remove debug symbols
                        &lt;p&gt;Generate JavaScript bindings with &lt;code&gt;--target web&lt;/code&gt; for ES module output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final size optimization pass with Binaryen's optimizer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Oz&lt;/code&gt;
                            Aggressive size optimization
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-bulk-memory&lt;/code&gt;
                            Faster memory operations
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-mutable-globals&lt;/code&gt;
                            Required for wasm-bindgen
                        &lt;code&gt;--enable-simd&lt;/code&gt;
                            SIMD instructions where applicable
                        &lt;p&gt;Despite all these optimizations, WASM bundles are still large because each one embeds the full tree-sitter runtime. We're exploring ways to share the runtime across grammars, but that's the architecture trade-off for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those use regex-based tokenization (TextMate grammars). Regexes can't count brackets, track scope, or understand structure—they just pattern-match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tree-sitter actually parses your code into a syntax tree, so it knows that &lt;code&gt;fn&lt;/code&gt; is a keyword only in the right
                                context, handles deeply nested structures correctly, and recovers
                                gracefully from syntax errors.
                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDEs with LSP support (like rust-analyzer) can do even better with semantic highlighting—they understand types and dependencies across files—but tree-sitter gets you 90% of the way there without needing a full language server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbor is Latin for tree (as in tree-sitter), and -ium denotes a place or collection (like aquarium, arboretum).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a place where tree-sitter grammars live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes! Open an issue on the repo with a link to the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll review it and add it if the grammar and highlight queries are in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doing full-stack Rust, it's nice to have exactly the same code on the frontend and the backend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rust crates compile to both native and WASM, so you get one dependency that works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree-sitter uses table-driven LR parsing. The grammar compiles down to massive state transition tables—every possible parser state and every possible token gets an entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tables are optimized for O(1) lookup speed, not size. A complex grammar like TypeScript can have tens of thousands of states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff is worth it: you get real parsing (not regex hacks) that handles edge cases correctly and recovers gracefully from syntax errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My lessons must be familiar to all Brits out there: conjugate être until it’s muscle memory, role-play booking a hotel you will never book, then leave school with the comforting illusion that you “know French” in the same way you “know trigonometry”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time French came in useful was a cafe in Chartres, a small town about an hour from Paris with a cathedral, nice streets, and, as far as I could tell that day, a collective commitment to not speaking English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I walked into a cafe feeling reasonably confident: asked for coffee in my best French and apparently did very well, because the barista replied with the total. It wasn’t even a hard number. But as it arrived as one continuous noise, I instantly gave up and defaulted to the internationally recognised protocol of tapping my card and pretending I am too busy looking at my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the gap language apps don’t really model: not “do you know the words?”, but “can you retrieve them when a human is waiting and you’ve got three seconds before you embarrass yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, planning a few months in Québec, I did what I always do before a move: learn the minimum viable politeness. Hello, sorry, thank you, the numbers, and the scaffolding around “can I get...”–enough to not be a complete nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried the usual apps: the streaks were pristine and the charts looked like I was becoming bilingual. But in my head I was still standing in Chartres, hearing “3,90” as “three-something-or-something” and sweating directly through my self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a safety net for the specific failure mode: retrieval under pressure, or just a tiny rehearsal room I could open while the kettle boiled, practise the bits that reliably go wrong, and close again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because I genuinely believe that constraints are important, I wrote down the rule that would make this harder than it needed to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The whole app is a blob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Childhood Trauma ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you grew up with Tamagotchis, you already understand why this was tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not the “cute pixel pet” part. The part where a device the size of a digestive biscuit turns into a low-resolution hostage negotiator. Feed me, clean me, entertain me. And if you don’t, I will beep during maths, get confiscated, and then die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They were brilliant because they weren’t productivity tools. They were tiny relationships. Everything was implied, physical, slightly unfair, and somehow more motivating than any "Time to stand!" push notification has ever been. If you came back after a day away, the creature didn’t show you a progress chart, it showed you a mood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the shape I wanted for language drills: something that feels less like “open app → consume lesson” and more like “tap creature → it looks at you → you do a small thing together”. I wanted the warmth and the immediacy, without the emotional extortion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my brief turned into a very narrow design constraint with a lot of consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No “home screen” full of destinations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No tests you have to take before you’re allowed to practise.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No progress cathedral you’re meant to worship in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just one scene, one character, and whatever information absolutely must leak through to make the interaction legible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to say “minimal”, but it’s so much harder to say “minimal and still usable by a human being who did not build it”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blob wasn’t a mascot here, it was the interface. Which meant it had to do interface work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Teaching a Circle to Care ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moment you remove buttons, menus, and visible structure, you inherit a new responsibility: you still owe people answers, you just can’t give them in text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you open a normal learning app, you get reassurance for free. There’s a big obvious “Start” button. There are labels and counters and little UI receipts that say “yes, you are in the right place, yes, tapping this will do something, yes, you did something yesterday”. It’s not glamorous, but it works, and the user doesn’t have to play detective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you open a blob, the user is staring at an animated shape on a gradient background and thinking, with complete justification: are you sure this is an app?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the first UX lesson was painfully simple: minimalism doesn’t grant telepathy. In a normal app the UI does a lot of quiet admin for you: it tells you what you can do next, what will happen if you tap, and whether you’re in the right place. When you delete all of that and leave a blob on a gradient, you’re basically asking the user to infer intent from body language. That can work–but only if the blob is unambiguous about two things: “yes, I’m interactive” and “yes, tapping me will lead somewhere predictable”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early Lexie was just a gently breathing circle. It looked calm, premium, vaguely spa-adjacent. It also looked like something you’d see right before a meditation app asks for an annual subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to solve it the “pure” way first: more animation, more suggestion, more “if you notice the micro-shift in the shape you’ll understand you can begin”. That’s a fun idea if your users have nothing else going on in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the shipped version, there is a Start button. It’s small and it doesn’t dominate the scene. It’s not there because it’s pretty but because people deserve certainty within half a second, and a blob cannot deliver that guarantee on its own without becoming theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a drill starts, nothing “navigates”. A prompt appears near the blob, and as you take your time answering the question, it subtly changes posture like it’s paying attention–a little lean, eyes tracking, the idle breathing tightening slightly. It’s a tiny moment, but it matters because it reframes what’s happening: you’re not entering a mode, you’re getting the creature’s focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then comes the most dangerous part of any character-driven UI: feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where every learning app turns into a casino if you let it. Confetti, fireworks, the whole 4th of July experience (I've seen it only in movies though, not sure why but it's not celebrated in the UK). “Amazing!” “Legendary!” “You’re on a roll!” If you answer correctly, a slot machine explodes. If you answer incorrectly, a disappointed owl files paperwork and probably takes away your dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not morally superior to particle effects and shaders. I built the confetti version and it was genuinely fun. It was also exhausting in the way a loud pub is exhausting: a bit of stimulation, then a sudden desire to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I stripped it down to feedback that reads instantly and ends quickly. A daily practice gets a small hop, a brief brightening, a few coins that pop out and arc back into the blob like it’s absorbing the reward to acknowledge, not to boost your dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incorrect answers were a bigger design fight than correct ones, because the default instincts are all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first “honest” version made the blob sad. Eyes down, posture slumped, colour cooled. It was expressive and clear, but nobody wants to practise French numbers if it means disappointing a creature you made to be comforting. Tamagotchi could do that to children in the noughties, but adults today will simply uninstall you and go drink water in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I switched the emotion from judgment to confusion. Miss, and Lexie looks like it’s thinking, slightly puzzled, waiting. It still reacts–you still get information–but it doesn’t weaponise your mistake into shame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is design work you don’t have to do if you use normal UI, which is the second UX lesson: removing UI doesn’t remove complexity. It relocates it into motion, timing, and body language, and those are harder to get right because you can’t label them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When Minimalism Hits a Wall ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third UX lesson arrived a week into using my own app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blob was fun, and I kept the drills short. The interaction felt calm in a way most learning apps don’t. I’d open it while waiting for the kettle, do a handful of prompts, watch the creature perk up, and then close it feeling vaguely responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, at some point, I realised I had no idea whether I was improving or just maintaining a pet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the trade you make when you pursue a “single-scene” interface too aggressively: you can remove friction, but you can also remove evidence. If the app never tells you anything in words or numbers, you end up in an uncanny situation where you feel like you’re doing something, but you can’t verify it. It’s the UX equivalent of “trust me, mate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testers (aka my wife, who am I kidding here) said the same thing but in more flattering terms: “Cute!” “Less scary than Duolingo.” Then the one question that matters: “Is this actually helping?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimalism is only luxurious if the user still feels in control. But you can't manage something if you can't measure it. So I broke the “blob only” purity in a way I could live with: I added small receipts that don’t turn the experience into a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a ring. It fills as you answer, like a quiet “enough for today” signal. When it completes, it does a subtle shimmer and then goes back to being decorative. It’s not there to gamify, it’s there to answer the simplest question: did I do anything meaningful, or did I just tap a circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a tiny streak pill. Just a small indicator that you’ve done something today, and that you’ve been roughly consistent recently. If you miss a day, it resets without drama, because drama is the entire behaviour I was trying to design out of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, a stats sheet that’s deliberately buried. There’s a small icon. Tap it and you get a panel with a few plain facts: how much you’ve practised recently and which ranges you struggle with. If you never open it, the app never nags you with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the shape I ended up believing in: keep the main surface quiet, but give the user an audit trail if they ask for it. The blob stays the primary interface, but it no longer asks for blind trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lines I Refused to Cross ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you add rings and streaks and coins, you’re standing at the top of a very slippery slope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more step and the ring becomes a flame, the streak turns into a guilt mechanic, the blob becomes a supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clearly effective and there apps successfully pulling that off. It’s also the opposite of the thing I was trying to build, so I ended up with a few hard lines that survived every “maybe we should...” conversation I had with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lexie can’t die. No pixel funeral, no neglected-pet tragedy, no “you failed” screen. If you keep getting things wrong, it doesn’t spiral into shame–it just... resets. A quiet little rebirth loop, the most Buddhist mechanic I could ship (I am not, as you can tell, a designer). If you vanish for a week, it goes a bit dim and undercharged, like it’s been sat in Low Power Mode, and then wakes up the second you tap it. Your life is allowed to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no “streak in danger” notification. If reminders ever exist, they’ll sound like a polite tap on the shoulder, not a fire alarm. I am not building a tiny manager that lives in your pocket and counts your absences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no leaderboard. The blob does not know your friends, but you get to keep your very own blob, isn't it cool?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rewards are cosmetic and unserious. You can unlock colours. The blob can wear a beret. It can look slightly more smug after you finally stop mixing up seventy and seventeen. None of it changes the learning itself. It just gives the relationship a bit of texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where the Tamagotchi inspiration loops back in a healthier form: the creature is there to make the interaction feel human, but it’s not allowed to punish you for being human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Now That I'm in Québec ¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time we actually arrived in Québec, I’d gained one extremely specific superpower: I can now hear a price and remain a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“3.99” registers as “money” instead of “incoming humiliation”. Phone numbers no longer turn into a single continuous noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Lexie didn’t solve–and was never meant to solve–is everything around the number. “Pour ici ou pour emporter” is currently my nemesis. The first time someone asked, I understood none of it and answered “oui” with enough confidence to make it everyone’s problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s fine though. The blob isn’t a French course. It drills what it can drill properly, like numbers, some core forms, the boring fundamentals that keep showing up, and then leaves the rest to real life. If you disappear for a week, it is not the end of the world–it just wakes up, gives you some hardcore numbers to translate again, and does a wee level-up jig like you’ve achieved something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which, to be fair, I have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like turning mildly humiliating real-world edge cases into shippable apps; if you have a few of those lying around, send them to work@drobinin.com.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rob Reiner, Legendary Director and Actor, and Wife Found Dead in Apparent Homicide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob Reiner, the legendary director and actor who rose to prominence in All in the Family and went on to direct the classic film comedies This Is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally…, died in his California home with his wife, Michele Singer, on Sunday. He was 78.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,” his family said in a statement. “We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Police are treating the deaths as apparent homicides. According to the L.A. Times, authorities have questioned a member of Reiner’s family in connection with the death. As of Sunday night, the LAPD have not officially identified a suspect, but Rolling Stone has confirmed that Reiner’s son, Nick, was involved in the homicide. A source confirmed to Rolling Stone that the couple’s daughter, Romy, found her parents’ bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The couple were found dead Sunday afternoon. Los Angeles Robbery Homicide Division detectives have been assigned to the case, NBC Los Angeles reports. Paramedics had been called to the home at around 3:30 p.m. and officers were dispatched after firefighters discovered a death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Born March 6, 1947 in New York, Reiner was the son of Carl Reiner, a giant in television and film comedy who created The Dick Van Dyke Show and directed The Jerk. When Rob Reiner set out to make his own name, he tried not to ride his father’s sizable coattails. “I didn’t take any money from him,” he recalled in 2016. “I didn’t take any advice. … I knew I was going to get that [nepotism] stuff. … But I knew in my head what I had done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Reiner played several bit roles in popular television shows in the Sixties, including Batman and The Andy Griffith Show, and partnered with Steve Martin writing for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, his breakout role came in the Seventies playing the liberal Mike “Meathead” Stivic, the son-in-law of the cantankerous conservative Archie Bunker (Carroll O’Connor) in Norman Lear’s hit sitcom, All in the Family, which ran from 1971 through 1979. Reiner won two Emmys for the portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During that time, he also guest starred on The Partridge Family and created the sitcom The Super, with Phil Mishkin and Gerry Isenberg, which aired in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But his artistic legacy was cemented by the string of wonderful, varied comedies he directed in the 1980s and nineties. With his 1984 debut This Is Spinal Tap, a mockumentary about a notoriously terrible U.K. metal band, Reiner worked with his stars and co-writers Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer to craft a heavily improvised film that made fun of rock-star egos and artistic pretensions. For Reiner, who was trying to make the leap from sitcom actor to movie director, the movie was a chance to prove himself to a skeptical industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At that time,” he wrote in the 2025 book A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever: The Story of Spinal Tap, “there was a big chasm in Hollywood between those who worked in television and those who worked in movies. The film people were considered royalty. They looked down on the lowly peasants of TV. Today, actors, writers, and directors easily shuttle between movies and television. But it wasn’t until such sitcom alums as Ron Howard, Danny DeVito, Penny Marshall, and I, along with the TV writers Barry Levinson and Jim Brooks, were successfully directing movies in the Eighties that these dividing lines were erased.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He followed This Is Spinal Tap with the 1985 romantic comedy The Sure Thing, starring relative unknown John Cusack, but his next five films were indelible. Adapting Stephen King’s novella The Body into Stand by Me, Reiner demonstrated his ability to elicit wonderfully lived-in performances from his young cast, which included Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O’Connell. The film launched their Hollywood careers and remains a beloved coming-of-age tale that Reiner once claimed was the film that meant the most to him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“[I]t was the first time I did a movie that really reflected my personality,” he later said. “It has some melancholy in it, it has some emotion and it also has humor in it and the music was of my time… I think people relate to it. There’s a line at the end of the movie where they say, ‘You never have friends like you do when you are 12.’ And that’s a true thing. When you bond with your friends when you are 12 years old, it’s a very strong emotional bond.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next year, he tackled another adaptation, William Goldman’s fantasy book The Princess Bride, and showed he was just as capable at crafting a tender, funny fairytale. As with his previous movies, The Princess Bride wasn’t simply popular but proved to be a warehouse for endlessly quotable lines: “Have fun storming the castle!” “Inconceivable!” These early hits catered to all ages, but with his 1989 film, When Harry Met Sally…, he produced one of the period’s wisest, most grownup romantic comedies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working from Nora Ephron’s flawless script, Reiner told the story of two platonic friends, Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), who eventually discover that they love each other. When Harry Met Sally… took the urban sophistication of Woody Allen’s best New York love stories and married it to contemporary concerns about relationships and, of course, faking orgasms. (The movie’s infamous scene with Ryan faking it in a restaurant was capped with Reiner’s own mother Estelle saying the key line: “I’ll have what she’s having.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reiner didn’t just master comedies: His 1990 adaptation of King’s bestselling novel Misery won Kathy Bates an Oscar for terrorizing James Caan’s poor novelist Paul Sheldon. Although darkly funny, Misery was also legitimately scary, further illustrating Reiner’s ability to know how to produce excellent mainstream Hollywood entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That roll continued with 1992’s A Few Good Men, with Aaron Sorkin adapting his own play for a live-wire courtroom drama highlighted by terrific performances from, among others, Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, whose momentous “You can’t handle the truth!” showdown was just one more example of Reiner conjuring up instant-classic moments in his box-office hits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the midst of this incredible run, he was unfailingly modest about his talents. “I’m not great at anything, but I’m real good at a lot of things,” he told Film Comment in 1987. “I’m a pretty good actor, a pretty good writer, I have pretty good music abilities, pretty good visual and color and costume sense. I’m not great at any of these things, but as a director I have the opportunity to utilize all these things in one job. Which is why I like doing it. … I pick people who are creative and gentle and are willing to struggle along with me a little bit if I’m not exactly sure. People say it’s a real sin for a director to ever admit he doesn’t know what he wants. But I’m as confused as the next guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reiner would knock out one last indisputable gem, the 1995 White House rom-com The American President. But if his career never contained another movie that captured the public’s imagination, he continued to make films on myriad topics, focusing chiefly on political issues he cared about. An outspoken liberal who criticized George W. Bush and Donald Trump, he turned that anger at the country’s right-ward direction into pictures such as LBJ and Shock and Awe, which were provocations meant to inspire everyday Americans to look more closely at their government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He would occasionally return to acting, agreeing to a recurring role in New Girl. Reiner appeared in movies like 1987’s Throw Momma From the Train and 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, and he was delightful in 2013’s The Wolf of Wall Street playing the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s unscrupulous stockbroker Jordan Belfort. And he enjoyed spoofing his own leftie image, playing himself as Rep. Rob Reiner in a memorable episode of 30 Rock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most recently, he made his first sequel, directing Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, which arrived in theaters in September. He reunited with Shearer, McKean, and Guest, reprising his role as clueless documentarian Marty DiBergi. Reiner and his stars had long resisted the temptation to make a Part Two. “We never even considered it,” he wrote in A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever. “Why fuck with a classic? … But after a few more meetings, we saw that we still made each other laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the wealth of enduring favorites Reiner directed, he was only nominated for one Oscar (Best Picture for A Few Good Men). But the endless rewatchability of his best movies speaks to what he achieved as a mainstream filmmaker, blending craft, smarts, heart, and humor in a way few directors managed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asked what makes a “Rob Reiner film” by 60 Minutes in 1994, Reiner explained that it was hard to categorize given his range of films, but “the main character in the film is always going through something that I’ve experienced or am experiencing, and I try to make it as personal as possible,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s the only way I know how to tell a story,” he continued. “I didn’t come through the film schools. I’m an actor, and I approach it from, can I inhabit the insides of this character? Can I be this person? And if I can, then I know how to tell the story of what that person is going through. And I also know how to tell the actor who’s playing that part, how to play the part.”&lt;/p&gt;
