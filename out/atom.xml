    &lt;p&gt;uv installs packages faster than pip by an order of magnitude. The usual explanation is “it’s written in Rust.” That’s true, but it doesn’t explain much. Plenty of tools are written in Rust without being notably fast. The interesting question is what design decisions made the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charlie Marsh’s Jane Street talk and a Xebia engineering deep-dive cover the technical details well. The interesting parts are the design decisions: standards that enable fast paths, things uv drops that pip supports, and optimizations that don’t require Rust at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The standards that made uv possible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pip’s slowness isn’t a failure of implementation. For years, Python packaging required executing code to find out what a package needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem was setup.py. You couldn’t know a package’s dependencies without running its setup script. But you couldn’t run its setup script without installing its build dependencies. PEP 518 in 2016 called this out explicitly: “You can’t execute a setup.py file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion without executing the setup.py file.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This chicken-and-egg problem forced pip to download packages, execute untrusted code, fail, install missing build tools, and try again. Every install was potentially a cascade of subprocess spawns and arbitrary code execution. Installing a source distribution was essentially &lt;code&gt;curl | bash&lt;/code&gt; with extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix came in stages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PEP 518 (2016) created pyproject.toml, giving packages a place to declare build dependencies without code execution. The TOML format was borrowed from Rust’s Cargo, which makes a Rust tool returning to fix Python packaging feel less like coincidence.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PEP 517 (2017) separated build frontends from backends, so pip didn’t need to understand setuptools internals.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PEP 621 (2020) standardized the &lt;code&gt;[project]&lt;/code&gt;table, so dependencies could be read by parsing TOML rather than running Python.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PEP 658 (2022) put package metadata directly in the Simple Repository API, so resolvers could fetch dependency information without downloading wheels at all.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PEP 658 went live on PyPI in May 2023. uv launched in February 2024. uv could be fast because the ecosystem finally had the infrastructure to support it. A tool like uv couldn’t have shipped in 2020. The standards weren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other ecosystems figured this out earlier. Cargo has had static metadata from the start. npm’s package.json is declarative. Python’s packaging standards finally bring it to parity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What uv drops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed comes from elimination. Every code path you don’t have is a code path you don’t wait for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uv’s compatibility documentation is a list of things it doesn’t do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No .egg support. Eggs were the pre-wheel binary format. pip still handles them; uv doesn’t even try. The format has been obsolete for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No pip.conf. uv ignores pip’s configuration files entirely. No parsing, no environment variable lookups, no inheritance from system-wide and per-user locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No bytecode compilation by default. pip compiles .py files to .pyc during installation. uv skips this step, shaving time off every install. You can opt in if you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virtual environments required. pip lets you install into system Python by default. uv inverts this, refusing to touch system Python without explicit flags. This removes a whole category of permission checks and safety code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stricter spec enforcement. pip accepts malformed packages that technically violate packaging specs. uv rejects them. Less tolerance means less fallback logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ignoring requires-python upper bounds. When a package says it requires &lt;code&gt;python&amp;lt;4.0&lt;/code&gt;, uv ignores the upper bound and only checks the lower. This reduces resolver backtracking dramatically since upper bounds are almost always wrong. Packages declare &lt;code&gt;python&amp;lt;4.0&lt;/code&gt; because they haven’t tested on Python 4, not because they’ll actually break. The constraint is defensive, not predictive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First-index wins by default. When multiple package indexes are configured, pip checks all of them. uv picks from the first index that has the package, stopping there. This prevents dependency confusion attacks and avoids extra network requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these is a code path pip has to execute and uv doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Optimizations that don’t need Rust&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of uv’s speed comes from Rust. But not as much as you’d think. Several key optimizations could be implemented in pip today:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTTP range requests for metadata. Wheel files are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. None of this requires Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallel downloads. pip downloads packages one at a time. uv downloads many at once. Any language can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global cache with hardlinks. pip copies packages into each virtual environment. uv keeps one copy globally and uses hardlinks (or copy-on-write on filesystems that support it). Installing the same package into ten venvs takes the same disk space as one. Any language with filesystem access can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python-free resolution. pip needs Python running to do anything, and invokes build backends as subprocesses to get metadata from legacy packages. uv parses TOML and wheel metadata natively, only spawning Python when it hits a setup.py-only package that has no other option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PubGrub resolver. uv uses the PubGrub algorithm, originally from Dart’s pub package manager. Both pip and PubGrub use backtracking, but PubGrub applies conflict-driven clause learning from SAT solvers: when it hits a dead end, it analyzes why and skips similar dead ends later. This makes it faster on complex dependency graphs and better at explaining failures. pip could adopt PubGrub without rewriting in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where Rust actually matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some optimizations do require Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zero-copy deserialization. uv uses rkyv to deserialize cached data without copying it. The data format is the in-memory format. Libraries like FlatBuffers achieve this in other languages, but rkyv integrates tightly with Rust’s type system.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thread-level parallelism. Python’s GIL forces parallel work into separate processes, with IPC overhead and data copying. Rust can parallelize across threads natively, sharing memory without serialization boundaries. This matters most for resolution, where the solver explores many version combinations.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No interpreter startup. Every time pip spawns a subprocess, it pays Python’s startup cost. uv is a single static binary with no runtime to initialize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compact version representation. uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are real advantages. But they’re smaller than the architectural wins from dropping legacy support and exploiting modern standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design over language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uv is fast because of what it doesn’t do, not because of what language it’s written in. The standards work of PEP 518, 517, 621, and 658 made fast package management possible. Dropping eggs, pip.conf, and permissive parsing made it achievable. Rust makes it a bit faster still.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pip could implement parallel downloads, global caching, and metadata-only resolution tomorrow. It doesn’t, largely because backwards compatibility with fifteen years of edge cases takes precedence. But it means pip will always be slower than a tool that starts fresh with modern assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other package managers could learn from this: static metadata, no code execution to discover dependencies, and the ability to resolve everything upfront before downloading. Cargo and npm have operated this way for years. If your ecosystem requires running arbitrary code to find out what a package needs, you’ve already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter how hard you work, it still takes a little bit of luck for something to hit. That can be discouraging, since luck feels like a force outside our control. But the good news is that we can increase our chances of encountering good luck. That may sound like magic, but it’s not supernatural. The trick is to increase the number of opportunities we have for good fortune to find us. The simple act of publishing your work is one of the best ways to invite a little more luck into your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we get into the “how,” it’s important to get on the same page about the “what.” What are we talking about when we say “luck?” There are a lot of definitions that could apply, but let’s stick with a simple one: Luck is when something unexpected and good happens to you. Unexpected and good. Who doesn’t want to increase the odds of something unexpected and good?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our world, luck can include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having your OSS library take off&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being invited to speak at a conference&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Landing a new job&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Getting a new consulting client&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being invited onto a podcast&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Making new friends in your community&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these things are totally in your control, which can at times feel frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can we increase the odds of finding luck? By being a person who works in public. By doing work and being public about it, you build a reputation for yourself. You build a track record. You build a public body of work that speaks on your behalf better than any resume ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is not to become famous, the goal is to increase the chances of luck finding us. For me, one of the most helpful ways to think about this has always been the concept of the “Luck Surface Area,” described in an old post by Jason Roberts. He wrote (and note, the emphasis is mine):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you’re passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going further, he codifies it into a formula where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Luck = [Doing Things] * [Telling People]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more things you do multiplied by the more people you tell, the larger your Luck Surface Area becomes. The larger your Luck Surface Area, the more likely you are to catch luck as it flows by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Source: Jason Roberts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Doing the work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you can publish your work, you have to actually do the work. The good news for you is that by even reading this Guide on The ReadME Project, you’ve probably already self-selected into a group of people for whom “doing things” comes somewhat naturally. You’re a developer, a designer, a creator, an author, or something else entirely. Whatever moniker you want to give yourself, you’re built to do things, and that’s the important part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t ring true for you, you may fall into one of two groups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You actually are doing things, you’ve just trained yourself to think that anything you do isn’t worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You want to be doing things, but you can’t bring yourself to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re in the first group, you may need to step back and reframe the work you’re already doing. This is a common blind spot for people who are executing at a high level! They’ve forgotten just how much they know. They think that they’re not doing anything interesting because they assume that everyone knows as much as they do. This effect is only exacerbated when everyone in your immediate vicinity is at a similar—or higher—skill level. As you become more of an expert, your quality bar gets higher and higher and you forget that everything you know is not known by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re in this group I want to give you a challenge: Watch the communities where you hang out and see what people are sharing and what gets noticed. Is it something you could have done? Is it something you’ve already done? At its worst this could lead you in the direction of becoming bitter, critical, and thinking that you’re smarter than everyone. To that I say “resist!” There is no life there. My encouragement to you is to view that as objective evidence that people want to know all of the things that you already know! There is a huge opportunity for you, should you decide to start sharing your work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re in the second group, you just need to start. Start anywhere, start on anything, start something. You’ll never come up with the perfect idea for an OSS library, a business, a podcast, or an article by just thinking about it. Start on something, today. It won’t be the perfect version of the thing you have in your head, but you’ll be in motion. Motion begets motion, progress begets progress. Pick the smallest thing you can do and get started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing the work is the most important part. It’s the nucleus around which everything else revolves. What that “work” looks like, though, is entirely up to you! That’s the fun part. It can take any form and be in any domain. Wherever your curiosity or expertise draw you, dive into that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Projects outside of work are a good place to dive into your curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to make a thermal receipt printer that prints GitHub issues, you should.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to turn a prefabricated shed into an office, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to go all in on an SVG drawing tool, do it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you want to write tens of thousands of words about the infrastructure of modern money, that’s a newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your curiosity will naturally pull you in certain directions, so don’t be afraid to go super deep into a topic that you’re interested in. When a person is truly interested in the thing they’re writing or talking about, their excitement is contagious. Whatever you’re excited about, be excited about it publicly. Whatever you’re curious about, be curious about it publicly. People will want to follow along and you’ll inspire people along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Projects at work can be a good place to dive into your expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's likely you're constantly solving problems and learning interesting things at your job. This is a great opportunity to take what you’re already doing and repurpose it for the benefit of others. You can turn those learnings into blog posts, conference talks, meetups, podcasts, or open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course not everything you do at work is shareable. If the specifics aren’t shareable, the concepts, lessons, and takeaways likely are. While you’re working, keep a scratch pad open and jot down any problems you come across, interesting patterns you see, or things you found confusing. Do this for a month and you’ll have more things to share than you know what to do with!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve done the work, now it's time to tell people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hitting the publish button&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This part of the formula can be harder for most of us. Most of us really enjoy the building aspect but start to get a little shy when it comes to telling people about the stuff we’ve built. That could be for any number of reasons: fear, embarrassment, self-preservation, or an aversion to being perceived as hawking your wares.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a valuable exercise to investigate whether or not you resonate with any of those reasons. Are you afraid people are going to make fun of what you built? Are you embarrassed that it isn’t up to your own (admittedly high) standards? Are you waiting for some elusive perfect moment? Do you have an aversion to “marketing” and don’t want to become the thing you hate? Whatever it is for you, I encourage you to really dig into it and see if that fear is worth keeping around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing things you’re learning or making is not prideful. People are drawn to other people in motion. People want to follow along, people want to learn things, people want to be a part of your journey. It’s not bragging to say, “I’ve made a thing and I think it’s cool!” Bringing people along is a good thing for everyone. By publishing your work you’re helping people learn. You’re inspiring others to create.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can “publish” anywhere. For me that’s mostly Twitter because that’s where most of my peers hang out. It doesn’t have to be Twitter for you. It could be GitHub, a newsletter, a podcast, forums, your blog, YouTube, or something completely different that’s not even on my radar. Anywhere that’s not your hard drive counts!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing is a skill, it’s something you can learn. You’ll need to build your publishing skill just like you built every other skill you have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to publish along the way. You don’t have to wait until you’re done to drop a perfect, finished artifact from the sky (in fact, you may use that as an excuse to never publish). People like stories, so use that to your benefit. Share the wins, the losses, and the thought processes. Bring us along! If you haven’t been in the habit of sharing your work, it’s going to feel weird when you start. That’s normal! Keep going, you get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve done the work. You’ve hit the publish button. You’ve done your part!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Capturing the luck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve increased the odds that good, unexpected things will come your way. The exact form is hard to predict, but here are a few potential outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People start to know you as the person that talks about X, Y, and Z.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You start to get emails from people saying that they read your stuff and liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You get a DM about a job you might be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;People ask you if you’re taking on new clients.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Someone you’ve never met or interacted with will mention you as being an expert in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A meetup asks you to come talk about the things you’ve been sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You become friends with other people in your industry.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your OSS library starts gaining mindshare.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a random list of made-up examples, it’s a list of things that have literally happened to me once I got over my fears and started sharing my work. I had been doing the work all along, but was too afraid to publish. Once I overcame that fear, my Luck Surface Area expanded and good, unexpected things started happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The formula is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do the work. Don’t be afraid to dive deep into your curiosity and your expertise. We need more people that are intensely curious. We need more people with deep expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tell people. Press publish, bring us along, share the journey. Tell us what you’ve learned, what you’ve built, or what you’re excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The formula may be simple, but I’ll admit it’s not always easy. It’s scary to put yourself out there. It’s hard to open yourself up to criticism. People online can be mean. But for every snarky comment, there are ten times as many people quietly following along and admiring not only your work, but your bravery to put it out publicly. And at some point, one of those people quietly following along will reach out with a life-changing opportunity and you’ll think, “Wow, that was lucky.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Try out the initial release of the QNX Developer Desktop -- a self-hosted development environment for QNX. No more cross-compilation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team and I are beyond excited to share what we've been cooking up over the last little while: a full desktop environment running on QNX 8.0, with support for self-hosted compilation! This environment both makes it easier for newly-minted QNX developers to get started with building for QNX, but it also vastly simplifies the process of porting Linux applications and libraries to QNX 8.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This self-hosted target environment is pre-loaded with many of the ports you'll find on the QNX Open-source Dashboard. (The portal currently includes over 1,400 ports across various targets, QNX versions, and architectures, of which more than 600 are unique ports!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this initial release, you can grab a copy of the QEMU image and give it a try for yourself. There's still so much more to add, but it's in a great place today for this first release. The team is really passionate about this one, and we're eagerly looking forward to your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's Included&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the initial release of Desktop, we tried to cover all the basics: windowing, terminal, IDEs, browser, file management, and samples. To that end, here's what makes up the QNX Developer Desktop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A customizable XFCE desktop environment running on Wayland&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tools you need to compile and/or run your code (&lt;code&gt;clang&lt;/code&gt;, gcc,&lt;code&gt;clang++&lt;/code&gt;, Python,&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, etc)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A web browser (can you join the QNX Discord from the QNX Desktop? 🏅👀)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ports of popular IDEs/editors, like Geany, Emacs, Neovim, and vim&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thunar, for file management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Preloaded samples, like Hello World in C, C++, and Python, and GTK demos OpenGL ES demos&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;... and of course, a terminal.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;System Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This environment runs as a virtual machine, using QEMU on Ubuntu. To try the image, you'll need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Keep in mind this is the first release, so it takes a minute to get started and it's a bit rough around the edges.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a free QNX license, you can find this release in QNX Software Center. On the Available tab of the Manage Installation pane, search for "quick start" and install the "QNX SDP 8.0 Quick Start Target Image for QEMU".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll find the image in your QNX installation directory, usually &lt;code&gt;~/qnx800/images&lt;/code&gt; by default. Follow the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt; directory to extract &amp;amp; combine the multiple QNX packages downloaded under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, follow the PDF instructions found in the new &lt;code&gt;./qemu_qsti/docs/&lt;/code&gt; directory to install the required dependencies and boot up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just the very first release! Over the next few months and beyond, we'll drop more updates of Desktop. You can look forward to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;QEMU images for Windows &amp;amp; macOS, and native images for x86&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A native Desktop image on Raspberry Pi&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced documentation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Features to help use this self-hosted environment in CI jobs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More samples &amp;amp; stability&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;... and more! Have suggestions? Let us know.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Get Help and Share Feedback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you want some help with your QNX journey, you can find the QNX team and community:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;in Discord here: discord.gg/Jj4EkkrFTT&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;pre-commit hooks are fundamentally broken&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start a new Rust project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Neat. Now let's say I add this to some list of fizzbuzz projects in different languages. Maybe .... this one. They tell me I need to have "proper formatting" and "use consistent style". How rude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe I can write a pre-commit hook that checks that for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neat! Let's commit that change.&lt;/p&gt;

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   main.rs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh ... We fixed the formatting, but we didn't actually stage the changes. The pre-commit hook runs on the working tree, not on the index, so it didn't catch the issue. We can see that the version tracked by git still has the wrong formatting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$  
fn main() { for i in 0.. {
    println ("fizzbuzz");
}}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we can make the script smarter? Let's checkout all the files in the index into a temporary directory and run our pre-commit hook there. 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$

+        println("fizzbuzz");
+    }
+}

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yay! That caught the issue. Now let's add our rust program to that collection of fizzbuzz programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Uh. Huh. Right. The code that was already here wasn't formatted according to rustfmt. Our script is running on every file in the git repo, so it won't let us commit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe we can change it to only run on modified files?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Alright. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's do one last thing. Let's say we had an existing PR to this repo and we need to rebase it. Maybe it had a merge conflict, or maybe there was a fix on main that we need in order to implement our solution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;Error: file `/tmp/best-fizzbuzz-ever-pre-commit.p3az/*.rs` does not exist
Could not apply 3d1bbf7... Add print.rs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two things went wrong here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our pre-commit hook can't handle commits that don't have any Rust files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our pre-commit hook ran on a branch we were rebasing. 2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixing the first thing doesn't really help us, because we don't control other people's branches. They might have used &lt;code&gt;git commit --no-verify&lt;/code&gt;.
They might not even have a pre-commit hook installed.
They might have had a branch that passed the hook when they originally wrote it, but not after a rebase (e.g. if your hook is &lt;code&gt;cargo check&lt;/code&gt; or something like that).
They might have had a branch that used an old version of the hook that didn't have as many checks as a later version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our only real choice here is to pass &lt;code&gt;--no-verify&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt; every time we run it, and to &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; for every commit in the rebase we modify,
and possibly even to every &lt;code&gt;git merge&lt;/code&gt; we run outside of a rebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is because pre-commit hooks are a fundamentally broken idea. Code does not exist in isolation. Commits that are local to a developer machine do not ever go through CI. Commits don't even necessarily mean that that the code is ready to publish—pre-commit hooks don't run on &lt;code&gt;git stash&lt;/code&gt; for a reason!
I don't use &lt;code&gt;git stash&lt;/code&gt;, I use &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; so that my stashes are tied to a branch, and hooks completely break this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of other footguns with pre-commit hooks. This doesn't even count the fact that nearly all pre-commit hooks are implemented in a broken way and just blindly run on the worktree, and are slow or unreliable or both. Don't get me started on pre-commit hooks that try to add things to the commit you're about to make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please just don't use &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt; hooks. Use &lt;code&gt;pre-push&lt;/code&gt; instead. 4
&lt;code&gt;pre-push&lt;/code&gt; hooks nearly avoid all of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only use case where I think pre-commit hooks are a good idea is for things that must never committed, that are worth interrupting a complicated rebase to prevent; namely: credentials. Once credentials are committed they're quite difficult to get out, and even harder to be sure you haven't missed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tips for writing a &lt;code&gt;pre-push&lt;/code&gt; hook
&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run on the index, not the working tree, as described above. 5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only add checks that are fast and reliable. Checks that touch the network should never go in a hook. Checks that are slow and require an up-to-date build cache should never go in a hook. Checks that require credentials or a running local service should never go in a hook.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be as quiet as possible. This hook is running buried inside a bunch of other commands, often without the developer knowing that the hook is going to run. Don't hide other important output behind a wall of progress messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't set the hook up automatically. Whatever tool you use that promises to make this reliable is wrong. There is not a way to do this reliably, and the number of times it's broken on me is more than I can count. Please just add docs for how to set it up manually, prominantly featured in your CONTRIBUTING docs. (You do have contributing docs, right?)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And don't write &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt; hooks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really quite slow on large enough repos, but there's not any real alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git stash --keep-index&lt;/code&gt;messes with git index state and also with your stashes. The only VCS that exposes a FUSE filesystem of its commits is Sapling, which is poorly supported outside Facebook. The best you can do is give up on looking at the whole working copy and only write hooks that read a single file at a time. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default this doesn't happen when running bare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rebase&lt;/code&gt;, but the second you add&lt;code&gt;--interactive&lt;/code&gt;, nearly anything you do runs a hook. Hooks will also run when you attempt to resolve merge conflicts. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;lint-staged&lt;/code&gt;does actually have a&lt;code&gt;--fail-on-changes&lt;/code&gt;flag which aborts the commit, but that still modifies the working tree, and it's not on by default. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more info about the difference, and a full list of possible hooks, see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;man 5 githooks&lt;/code&gt;. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Notice that I don't say "only run on changed files". That's because it's not actually possible to reliably determine which branch the current commit is based on, the best you can do is pick a random branch that looks likely. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OrangePi 6 Plus Review: The New Frontier for ARM64 SBC Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after our previous reviews (that started mainly around RISC-V since we are really interested in this new architecture) of SBC, we continue to review what’s available these days in the world of small, versatile computers. Today this is going to be about the OrangePi 6 Plus, following our previous review of the OrangePi 5 ultra board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is NOT a super small, credit card format SBC. We are talking about something that’s definitely larger, and that comes directly with an integrated heatsink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the bottom there’s a wealth of ports, and it’s where you will install the necessary wireless module if you want Wifi and Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s dive into what you can do with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what you can get from the top of the device. Note that most of it will be hidden from view as the board comes pre-installed with the heatsink that covers the SOC and the memory chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the bottom view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can tell just from the format that you should have higher expectations from the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Specs of the OrangePi 6 Plus&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As you can see from the specs, this is no joke. 16GB RAM by default, 12-cores processor, with a powerful GPU (Immortalis G720), and a NPU that has a claimed performance up to 30 TOPS. Not just that, but there’s numerous ports on this SBC, with 2 full sized M2 2280 slots! You can tell that the IO is not going to be a joke here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are wondering about the SOC itself, we have more info about what to expect from CIX.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2.8Ghz ARM Big Cores processors! That’s no joke, this is way beyond the typical frequency we see for small boards where things are usually below 2 Ghz. The memory interface also has a huge bandwidth, and we get full PCI4 with 8 lanes! This means that this board could probably be attached to an external GPU (eGPU) and be able to drive it (provided adequate software support).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About the NPU, the usual problem on Linux is that there is poor software support, and it’s certainly not in the mainline either. To leverage the 30 TOPS of dedicated AI power, you cannot simply use standard versions of PyTorch or TensorFlow out of the box. You must use the NeuralONE AI SDK. This also means that the NPU cannot use regular weights, and need to compile them into a different format to make them work. On paper, the NPU is highly versatile and supports the following data types: INT4, INT8, INT16, FP16, BF16, and TF32. The board has extensive documentation on a bunch of embedded models for vision detection, automation, such as YOLOv8 (Vision), ResNet50, OpenPose, and DeepLabv3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s jump into the actual user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Desktop Experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Debian Bookworm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a Debian Bookworm (12) image available at the time of writing. I was actually waiting for a 24.04 Ubuntu image to be made available, and that was the plan at some point according to my OrangePi contact, but they had to shift priorities apparently and now there is no ETA for the Ubuntu image. So instead of waiting, I decided to go ahead and review what’s possible with this Debian image. As you know, Debian Bookworm is not that new anymore (the base is from Mid-2023), and is now superseded by Debian Trixie (released in 2025). This Debian image comes with two kernels available, 6.1 and 6.6. The 6.6 kernel is also from 2023, and it’s not surprising you don’t get a more recent kernel, since the Linux support for various parts of the boards, not being upstreamed and mainlined, is very likely to be stuck on an older version. This is usually what causes headaches down the road: maybe some general functionality can be upstreamed, but will the NPU have working drivers for a more recent kernel? Your guess is as good as mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can burn the image directly on the NVME drive - no need to boot on a MicroSD card this time around. Note that at the beginning, my OrangePi did not boot, but I could see from the BIOS (yes, this board comes with a BIOS-like interface!) that everything was supposed to be seen by the SBC. Turns out that the firmware required an update to be able to boot on this Linux kernel, and after imaging the latest firmware on a USB stick and booting on it, a few minutes later, things worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, we get a GNOME desktop after boot. And everything works pretty much as you’d expect. Once thing that is immediately apparent when you start with the desktop is how snappy everything is. SBC boards like the Raspberry Pi 4 provide a good desktop experience but have some general sluggishness to them. On this board, this is pretty much like having a X86_64 experience. It recognized immediately my Ultra Wide Display and supported the 3440 x 1440 resolution without a hitch. Everything from navigating the desktop and settings is very fast. You get Chromium by default (and Firefox ESR in the repos) and the browser experience is very clean and fast, too. This board has absolutely no problem to play Youtube streams, even at 4k. This thing is FAST!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick look at vulkaninfo shows that we have working Vulkan drivers on this board! This is something that was initially very exciting, but it turns out that there are some limitations. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out the Vulkan driver is limited to some early 1.3 version. You have options to upgrade Mesa, by using Debian backports - it gets you to a 25.07 Mesa version, where you don’t rely anymore on the proprietary driver - no, this time you get Panfrost, which means a more robust driver potentially… except that you are stuck on the 6.6 Linux Kernel, and Panfrost requires a more recent kernel to work properly (6.10+ apparently). So the solution would be to move to a more recent kernel, right? Do the Debian backports have it? Yes. Problem is, moving away from 6.6 will break a lot of patches that are necessary for the hardware of this board to work. Such as HDMI out at resolutions higher than 1080p, and NPU support! So, it’s a major trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Getting Bluetooth to work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though bluetooth shows in the GNOME desktop controls, and that it could see some of my peripherals, it could not connect to any of my external audio devices. But I don’t give up so fast. Turns out there’s an issue with a missing pipewire dependency to allow for bluetooth audio to work. Here’s how you can get it done:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install libspa-0.2-bluetooth pipewire-audio-client-libraries
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afterwards you can launch bluetoothctl from the command line, and you can execute the following commands one by one&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;power on
agent on
default-agent
scan on
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the scan is activated you should see bluetooth device popping up in the terminal. Note the ID of the bluetooth device you want to connect, and then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pair &amp;lt;device id&amp;gt;
trust &amp;lt;device id&amp;gt;
connect &amp;lt;devic_id&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once this is fixed, things work as expected. And now I get audio!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Compiling OBS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OBS is not available as flatpak for arm64, and not in the repos either. This means, that you are in for a compilation from sources. This is not the thing that scares me. But in our situation, it’s a little more convoluted that I expected. First, turns out that OBS did not like the fact that the Cmake was relatively old. So I had to get one of the recent Cmake binaries. Thanksfully they have arm64 binaries already available on their website, so that was easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, OBS would complain of a too old FFmpeg version. Not too surprising for something that depends so heavily on it. So I had to go for a full FFmpeg compilation. Here’s what I did to save you time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git
cd ffmpeg
git checkout release/7.1 # in order to have a stable release, not the master branch in itself

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265
make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, compiling OBS is a game of cat and mouse, you need to basically give up one extension after the other as new errors arise. Most of the things you need to remove are not critical (NVENC, not relevant on non-nvidia hardware, browser support, not really our thing either) and at the end you get a fairly long series of command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio.git
cd obs-studio

# remove the obs-browser plugin from the obs folder root directlroy
mv plugins/obs-browser plugins/obs-browser.bak

# from the obs root folder
git submodule update --init --recursive

# a couple of exports to avoid the compilation to fail because of FFmpeg warnings
export CFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations"
export CXXFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations"

# since the flags can be ignored, we also edit the following file from the root directory
echo 'target_compile_options(obs-ffmpeg PRIVATE "-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations")' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; plugins/obs-ffmpeg/CMakeLists.txt

# use the path to the cmake version you just downloaded
&amp;lt;path_to_newer_cmake_binary&amp;gt;/cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local -DFFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include  -DPKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig -DENABLE_AJA=OFF -DUNIX_STRUCTURE=1 -DENABLE_GIO=OFF -DENABLE_VPL=OFF  -DENABLE_QSV11=OFF -DENABLE_BROWSER=OFF  -DENABLE_WEBRTC=OFF -DENABLE_NATIVE_NVENC=OFF -DCMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR=OFF ..

make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took a little while, but it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I must admit, I did not expect that it would go so well in the end. Now, thanks to this, you will get a lot of videos from the board in action that no other site reviewing that board has been able to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Noise and Temperature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The board is very quiet by default. Even when the fan is activated, you barely hear it, at least under fairly typical conditions. Things change when you push the board to its full power, for example a long compilation time. In such conditions, the fan becomes louder with a woosh kind of sound. You will definitely hear it when doing benchmarks, and in my case, when running LLMs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of temperature, the control is very good. At 100% usage even for long durations, while the fan becomes clearly noticeable, it maintains the temperature under 60 C (this is winter right now, and the temperature remained at 58 C). Kudos for the good engineering there. It’s as good as the custom cooling solution for my RTX3090.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Power Draw&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t have a way to measure the power draw currently, but based on reports from other publications it looks like we are looking at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;15W at idle, which is fairly high&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;30+W during usage - this is why they recommend to use the provided PSU with USB-C. Note that any charger that can provide 45W should do the trick as well.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if you are looking for something that has almost no footprint at idle, this is not it. At idle the OrangePi 5 Ultra consumes more than 3 times less, so that sound more like something you’d use for a server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick run at Geekbench 6 shows a very strong single core score, and an exceptional multi-core score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the details in single score:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in multi-core where we can see that the OrangePi 6 absolutely crushes what you can find on a Raspberry Pi 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a relatively cheap system that is not going to win the benchmark charts. But look at the results. On single core, we get a score equivalent to a i5-10500 running at a similar frequency (2.3 Ghz).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On multicore this is much more impressive, thanks to its twelve cores. And it gets very close, according to the bench, to what an AMD Ryzen 7 4800H (8 cores) can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is clearly a powerhouse, CPU-wise. For a starting price at 199 USD for the 16GB version, this is a fantastic value proposition. We reviewed the OrangePi 5 Ultra a few months back and the price point is very close (around 160 USD), and unless you need something very small and fanless, the OrangePi 6 Plus is (very clearly) a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Gaming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we have both a fairly powerful SOC, and a working Vulkan driver, this means that we can expect Box64 to do some magic for us there. I compiled Box64 to make it possible to launch Steam, and for some reason there is some Vulkan related error that prevents Steam from launching. Too bad. I still have a GOG account with a few games that have Linux clients. I tried the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Beholder 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shadow Warrior 2013&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oxenfree&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Day of the Tentacle Remastered&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Torchlight 2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with some degree of success! Beholder 2 worked just fine, and are definitely playable on this board, while the framerate remains between the 20s and 30s FPS (here a little slower on this video because of software OBS capture).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s Oxenfree’s Linux x86_64 client running in Full HD on the OrangePi 6 Plus, using Box64:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Torchlight 2 runs nicely too, at something like 20 to 30 FPS in Full HD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shadow Warrior refused to launch, complaining about the graphics drivers not being recent enough (turns out that Zink provides OpenGL support, and there is some issue to detect that the OpenGL version is properly supported… my guess). Day of the Tentacle crashes at start too, not sure why. When games work, the performance is not staggering but convincing for a somewhat small SoC at the end of the day. AMD and Intel are certainly ahead in terms of graphics performance on integrated chips, but they have much larger processors and much more expensive ones, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tried FOSS games or engines:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GZDoom (compiled from source, the flatpak version sucks in performance!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Luanti (ex-Minetest)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IOQuake3 (compiled from source)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OAD (from Debian repos)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GZDoom works exceptionally well with the OpenGLES renderer at Full HD. It’s fast, responsive. Stable at 60 FPS on Full HD. And Doom is still as fun as it was in the days, or more so if you run Brutal Doom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I don’t have a sample video here, Quake 3 Arena with the IOQuake3 engine works perfectly, and runs at 60 fps on Full HD without a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luanti (ex Minetest) works extremely well - I turned most of the details to the max at 1080p and it kept at a solid 60 FPS. Sure, that’s no AAA game, but it’s a good alternative to Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0Ad works extremely well, even in full screen at my Ultra Wide screen resolution. I took a video at FUll HD, and while OBS does slow the framerate a little, you can still see it’s very smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0ad has come a long way, I really need to revisit a recent version of the game to see how much it has changed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Server use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very capable board that would make a very powerful server. The Debian image comes with Docker, and as we have seen before during the OrangePi 5 Ultra review, the landscape of ready-to-use Docker Hub images is huge and can get you started with numerous server-side applications in no time. Since we have at least 16Gb of memory, very fast I/O (PCIe4!), and a very fast CPU, this SBC will be able to wonders with a wide variety of applications. The only problem is the power draw. It looks like we are stuck with 15W as an idle baseline, and that seems a bit too much for some light server use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AI applications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This board comes with a very large repository (60 GB!) that you can install and sync automatically, with tons of applications and demos you can try out. There is a large part of their documentation dedicated to that part in their manual. And for what I could try, it seems to work as long as you follow their instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case I like to work with LLMs for a range of applications, so I was interested to see how fast this board could run some small-ish models. One of the major limitations is that we don’t have working NPU support for llama.cpp (oh no!). I was thinking, “no worries, we have a vulkan driver so let’s use Vulkan instead”. I like to be optimistic sometimes. Turns out that the Vulkan driver is below the minimum Vulkan drivers specs required by llama.cpp recently, and I would need to go back to a end 2024 build to be able to compile for Vulkan support. Going back one year on llama.cpp… not an option, sorry (too many models would not be supported going back so far in time). So, we are left with using the raw power of the CPU. Which means it won’t be quiet - expect some good old noise fan in such use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went for Qwen3 1.7b - downloaded the safetensors weights, then converted them to gguf, followed by a quantization step to make them IQ4_S. Running the model at this kind of quantization gives us about 14 tokens per second when doing inference. Definitely usable, very usable even, while this is a small model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, you’d want to have a board that can run a 7b model with proper hardware acceleration and no fan usage. Not sure if having actual NPU support in the future would help for that or not. In other words, we are not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Existing Alternatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual there is not a single vendor who can provide you with a CIX experience. This time the main competitor is Radxa, and they have two boards called Orion 6 that feature the same chip - one that is much bigger in footprint (mini-ITX size), and another one that is more similar to the OrangePi 6 Plus size (the Orion 6N). While I don’t have access to the Radxa ones, I can’t comment on how good their support is, but they are very likely to suffer from the same limitations, software wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As expected, they also only provide a Debian Bookworm image under the Radxa OS nickname so this is no different from what you can get on the OrangePi 6 Plus. Price-wise, they are both available at around similar price points, so you could make you decision based on the best deal you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Verdict&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very impressive SBC, with an exceptional value proposition. Its performance profile puts if far away from the toy category from what we have seen before in the SBC category, and puts it right into the desktop performance realm. It’s still relatively small so you could easily attach it behind a monitor and power a personal computer this way. As a Linux user, things are so fast that you’d be very surprised this is an ARM board running under the hood. For server use, you’d probably want to avoid this one, because of the fairly heavily baseline power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, the pitfalls are always going to be the same. This time around you get an older Debian image (bookworm), with an older kernel (6.6), and some proprietary drivers that you have to live with. Ultimately if you want to upgrade the software running on your SBC that will mean breaking things, and there’s often a fairly long time (if ever) for some hardware components to be supported in newer distros. It’s not necessarily a deal breaker these days. This board is fast enough to compile software fairly quickly if needed. You have Flatpak as well providing some good coverage for a lot of application (even if performance may be sub-par). There are ongoing efforts to mainline the GPU found in the chip, so it could be that a year from now we are in a better place when it comes to proper hardware support beyond kernel 6.6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, this is a surprising new entry in terms of performance / price point. This puts the bar very high for future SBCs ARM64 SBCs. On a personal note, I’d like to see some serious hardware dedicated to running AI models (instead of large desktops chaining multiple GPUs), and maybe highly customized ARM64 SBCs are going to become one option at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in getting one, there are many resellers, but one of the most direct ones are on Aliexpress:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the difference of price between 16 GB and 32GB is so small currently, it would make total sense to go for the 32GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: we were provided with a review unit from OrangePi (more specifically the OrangePi 6 Plus 16GB version).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a small BASIC interpreter that I wrote in the early 1990s. For some reason I think it is one of the coolest programs I have ever written. Maybe because it is just a bit under 5K bytes large and still does something useful. Maybe it is just nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting programs I have written in NMH BASIC is a variant of the well-known mine sweeper game that runs in text mode. Not just text mode, actually, but (tele)typewriter mode, as it reprints the playing field after every move.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The screenshots use Viacheslav Slavinsky's excellent GlassTTY font, a TrueType font that perfectly resembles the one used in the DEC VT-220 terminal. The same font, at bigger magnification, is used in the NMH BASIC logo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is maybe interesting about the mine sweeper clone is that it uses a stackless floodfill algorithm that stores its state in the playing field itself and needs no dynamic memory at all. I have recently described it in the paper A Stackless Floodfill Automaton (PDF, 34KB). A demo showing an animation of the algorithm is included in the NMH BASIC package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other programs in the package, most of them rather simple, like an implementation of the Hangman game, the (rather pointless) Nim game, a banner printer, a random number generator, etc. NMH BASIC does not have a RNG, so a 15-bit linear feedback shift register is implemented in BASIC to generate pseudo-random numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first program I have ever written in NMH BASIC was the inevitable prime number sieve. I have no idea how often I have loaded and run it in the past decades - until the Floodfill demo became my new favorite. Here is the code of my first NMH BASIC program (the backslash is the division remainder operator):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;10 REM 'PRINT PRIME NUMBERS' 20 REM 'M = NUMBER OF PRIMES TO PRINT' 100 LET M = 1000 105 DIM Z(M) 110 LET Z(0) = 2 : LET T = 1 : LET P = 1 115 PRINT 2, 120 IF T &amp;gt;= M GOTO 200 130 LET P = P+2 : LET O = 1 140 FOR I = 0 TO T-1 150 IF P\Z(I) = 0 LET O = 0 : LET I = T 160 NEXT 170 IF O = 0 GOTO 120 180 LET Z(T) = P : LET T = T+1 185 PRINT P, 190 GOTO 120 200 END&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote the first version of NMH BASIC in 1994, recycling some parts that I had written in the years 1991..1993. The first version that I wrote in 1994 was a prototype in BASYL-II which I then translated, function by function, to 8086 assembly language. The resulting executable had a size of about 4700bytes and because the token representation that the interpreter uses internally is quite efficient, you could do interesting things with NMH BASIC in as little as 12Kbytes of memory. I had named the interpreter 12K-BASIC initially, but soon learned that others had had that idea before me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course in 1994 memory was already measured in megabytes, so you might say that writing a tiny BASIC interpreter was kind of pointless at that time. It depends I would say; it is better than getting drunk in a bar, and now, almost 30 years later, I still enjoy playing with this little program. So much, in fact, that I decided to translate the original code to T3X/0, so that I can play with it on Unix without having to use an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the above versions are included in the package: the original BASYL-II version, the assembly language version, and the new T3X version. You can recompile the T3X version with T3X/0 and the 8086 assembly language version with TASM or MASM. You need to create a COM file or it will not run. A precompiled COM file and Tcode machine executable (as well as a Tcode machine for Unix) are also included in the package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a simplified version of the interpreter that runs under CP/M. A COM file for CP/M (BASICS.COM) is also included in the archive. The CP/M version currently needs 32K bytes of TPA to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NMH BASIC language contains some interesting (IMHO) hacks to make its implementation simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All variables have either single-character names or names consisting of a character and a digit, like A0, B2, Z9, etc. The expressions A and A0 and A(0) all refer to the same variable. If you do not use A0..A9, you can use A as a 10-slot array A(0) .. A(9). Or you can use A5 in the place of A(5) if you are refering to a fixed slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is getting even weirder. A(10) is the same as B or B0 or B(0). A(22) is equal to C2 or C(2) and, finally, A(259) would be equal to Z(9). So, for instance, if you do not use any Z's, you can use Y as a 20-slot array. In this case the command &lt;code&gt;DIM Y(20)&lt;/code&gt; is really
a null-operation. It merely serves as a reminder that Y is a 20-slot
array (and Z should not be used).
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also use Y as a 50-alot array by dimensioning it with &lt;code&gt;DIM Y(50)&lt;/code&gt;. In this case the elements of Z will still be used, but
40 additional slots will be allocated to integer variable storage,
so Z becomes a 40-slot array and Y a 50-slot array. It probably
goes without saying that most programs either use single-character
variables as 10-slot arrays or dimension Z, if a larger array is
needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also means that &lt;code&gt;DIM Y(50)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DIM Z(50)&lt;/code&gt; in the same program
would just allocate 50 integer slots to Z and the last 40 slots of Y would
overlap with the slots of Z. Having multiple large arrays in the
same NMH BASIC program requires some hacking, like using Z(0)..Z(99)
for one array and Z(100)..Z(199) for the other.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the definition of "large" above. NMH BASIC uses 12Kbytes of memory in total: for integer variables, string variables, program memory, stacks, and the machine code of the interpreter itself! You could probably write a version of this interpreter that would run on a CP/M machine with as little as 16K bytes of transient program area (but I have never done so).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interpreter performs I/O on "units", where each unit is assigned a file or device when the interpreter is started. NMH BASIC programs cannot open or close any files. They can only redirect input and output to the assigned units. I/O is sequential, i.e. each unit is like a tape drive. The following program prints the data stored on unit #5:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;100 LET X = IOCTL(5, 100) : INPUT #5 110 INPUT A$ : IF ASC(A$) = 255 INPUT #0 : END 120 PRINT A$ : GOTO 110&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The statement &lt;code&gt;INPUT #5&lt;/code&gt; redirects input to unit #5, so from that point
on all INPUT statements will read from that unit. (Analogously,
&lt;code&gt;PRINT #5&lt;/code&gt; would redirect output to unit #5.) When a string read from
a unit contains the value 255 in its first slot, there is no more
input available from the current input unit. &lt;code&gt;INPUT #0&lt;/code&gt; connects input
back to the keyboard. Note that &lt;code&gt;PRINT #1&lt;/code&gt; would connect output back
to the screen.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an IOCTL function that can perform several "services" on a unit, like rewinding it, appending to it (moving the read/write pointer to the end of the unit), or truncating it (or writing an EOF marker on a tape). The IOCTL call in the above example rewinds the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maximum length of a line or string is 64 bytes. Reading anything longer, either via INPUT or by entering it at the interpreter prompt, will result in an error. The CR,LF characters that separate lines are not counted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have forgotten how other BASIC dialects handle this, but I suspect that NMH BASIC is the odd one out here: in an IF statement the entire rest of the line is executed conditionally. For example&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;IF 1 = 1 PRINT 'FOO' : PRINT 'BAR'&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;would print both FOO and BAR. There is no THEN or ELSE keyword. The first keyword after the condition of IF starts the conditional part of the IF statement. When the condition in IF is false, the interpreter advances to the next line. An alternative branch is implemented with jump around jumps using GOTO:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;100 IF condition GOTO 130 110 alternative statements 120 GOTO 140 130 consequent statements 140 REM&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, if the condition and statements are short:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;100 IF condition statements 110 IF # condition statements&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The # operator implements the logical NOT. It had high precedence in NMH BASIC up to version 1.2, but has very low precedence in NMH BASIC II. Interestingly, this change did not affect any programs in the archive. There is a logical AND, but not a logical OR in IF. If there are multiple conditions separated by commas then the conditional statements will only execute, if all conditions are true. For example, the statement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;IF 0 &amp;lt; C, C &amp;lt; 11 STOP&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;will stop program execution, if C is in the range 1..10. To implement a logical OR, multiple IF statemements with the same conditional part (or jumps around jumps) have to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NMH BASIC 1.x listed programs with blanks between all adjacent tokens. NMH BASIC II uses a more compact representation. Either way is merely a characteristic of the LIST routine, though. You can enter a program as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;FOR I=1TO10:PRINT A(I):NEXT&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but the LIST command will print it as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;FOR I = 1 TO 10 : PRINT A ( I ) : NEXT&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in NMH BASIC and as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;FOR I = 1 TO 10 : PRINT A(I) : NEXT&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in NMH BASIC II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has the weird side effect that sometimes you can SAVE a program but cannot LOAD it later, because some lines will be shorter than 64 characters when you enter them, but LIST (and hence SAVE) will blow them up to a bigger size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is mostly a problem in NMH BASIC 1.x, which inserts blanks between all tokens. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;100 IF ASC(MID$(A$, I, 1)) = ASC('X') LET X = X+1 : GOTO 120 ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6---| 100 IF ASC( MID$( A$ , I , 1 ) ) = ASC( 'X' ) LET X = X + 1 : GOTO 120&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no workaround. When a program cannot be loaded, the only remedy is to edit it with a text editor and fix it, either by removing unnecessary blanks or, even better, by splitting the offending line. E.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;100 LET C = ASC( MID$( A$ , I , 1 ) ) 105 IF C = ASC( 'X' ) LET X = X + 1 : GOTO 120&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, it is a good idea to keep NMH BASIC programs in DOS text format with CR/LF line separators, even on Unix systems, because otherwise the DOS version of the interpreter will refuse to load them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2024 I changed a few things and pubished a new version of NMH BASIC, which I called, for lack of imagination, NMH BASIC II. The new version changes the precedence of the # (logical NOT) operator from highest to lowest (this was a mistake in the original version!) and uses a more compact and more comprehensible LIST format, which is also used for saving programs. Because some code was simplified in the interpreter at the same time, the new version is one byte smaller than the original version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download: nmhbas3_30.zip (version 3.0, 105KB) | man page&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Version 3.x of NMH BASIC is an in-progress version that differs from the previous versions in a few points that are described in detail in the manual. Most prominently, the CMPS ("compare strings") function has been replaced with string comparison operators, so, for example,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;IF CMPS(A$, 'FOO') = 0 PRINT 'YEP'&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;would now be written as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;IF A$ = 'FOO' PRINT 'YEP'&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, NMH BASIC III supports baudot-encoded units. This means that any unit connected to the interpreter can be written to and read from using five-channel baudot-encoding (CCITT-2, US-TTY). So the interpreter can, in theory, save and load programs to/from five-hole paper tape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The T3X/0 version of the interpreter is currently fully working. There also is a more efficient Z80 version written in assembly language, which is work in slow progress. It currently runs all the example programs, but lacks baudot-encoded units and may still have a few bugs. An 8086 version written in assembly language may appear later.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Central Banks diversify their holdings into dozens of smaller “non-traditional reserve currencies.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;By Wolf Richter for WOLF STREET.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The share of USD-denominated assets held by other central banks dropped to 56.9% of total foreign exchange reserves in Q3, the lowest since 1994, from 57.1% in Q2 and 58.5% in Q1, according to the IMF’s new data on Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;USD-denominated foreign exchange reserves include US Treasury securities, US mortgage-backed securities (MBS), US agency securities, US corporate bonds, and other USD-denominated assets held by central banks other than the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excluded are any central bank’s assets denominated in its own currency, such as the Fed’s Treasury securities or the ECB’s euro-denominated securities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not that foreign central banks dumped US-dollar-denominated assets, such as Treasury securities. They did not. They added a little to their holdings. But they added more assets denominated in other currencies, particularly a gaggle of smaller currencies whose combined share has surged, while central banks’ holdings of USD-denominated assets haven’t changed much for a decade, and so the percentage share of those USD assets continued to decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the dollar’s share declines toward the 50% line, the dollar would still be by far the largest reserve currency, as all other currencies combined would weigh as much as the dollar. But it does have consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why is having the top reserve currency important for the US?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foreign central banks buying USD-denominated assets, such as Treasury securities, helps push up prices and push down yields of those assets. Being the dominant reserve currency had the effect of helping the US borrow more cheaply to fund its huge twin deficits – the trade deficit and the budget deficit – and thereby has enabled the US to run those huge twin deficits for decades. At some point, this continued decline as a reserve currency, as it reduces demand for USD debt, would make the trade deficit and the budget deficit more difficult to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dollar’s share had already been below 50% before, in 1990 and 1991, after a long plunge from the peak in 1977 (share of 85.5%). This plunge accompanied a deep crisis in the US with sky-high inflation and interest rates, and four recessions over those years, including the nasty double-dip recession. Central banks lost confidence in the Fed’s willingness or ability to do what it takes to get this inflation under control that had washed over the US in three ever larger waves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dotted line in the chart below indicates the 50%-share. The dollar’s share bottomed out at 46% in 1991, by which time the Fed had brought inflation under control, and soon, central banks began loading up on dollar-assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then came the euro, which turned into the next set-back for the dollar, but not nearly as much as European politicians had promised when pushing the euro through the system; they were talking about parity with the dollar. That talk ended with the Euro Debt Crisis that began in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, over the past 10 years, came dozens of smaller “non-traditional reserve currencies,” as the IMF calls them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chart shows the dollar’s share at the end of each year, except 2025 where it shows the share in Q3:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But they didn’t actually dump USD-denominated securities.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foreign central banks increased their holdings of USD-denominated assets by a hair in Q3 to $7.4 trillion, the third increase in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since mid-2014, despite some sharp ups and downs, their holdings of USD-assets have remained essentially flat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what has caused the percentage share of USD assets to decline over the years is the growth of foreign exchange reserves denominated in other currencies, particularly many smaller currencies, as central banks have been diversifying their growing pile of foreign exchange assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chart below shows foreign central banks’ holdings of USD-denominated assets – US Treasury securities, US MBS, US agency securities, US corporate bonds, etc. – in trillions of dollars:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The top foreign exchange reserves by currency.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Central banks’ holdings of foreign exchange reserves in all currencies, and expressed in USD, rose to $13.0 trillion in Q3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Top holdings, expressed in USD:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;USD assets: $7.41 trillion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Euro assets (EUR): $2.65 trillion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yen assets (YEN): $0.76 trillion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;British pound assets (GBP): $0.58 trillion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Canadian dollar assets (CAD): $0.35 trillion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Australian dollar assets (AUD): $0.27 trillion&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chinese renminbi (RMB) assets: $0.25 trillion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The euro’s share, #2, has been around 20% since 2015. Before the Euro Debt Crisis, it was on an upward trajectory and had already risen to nearly 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the reserve currencies are the colorful spaghetti at the bottom of the chart (more in a moment). Combined, they have gained share over the years, at the expense of the dollar, while the euro’s share has remained roughly stable since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The rise of the “non-traditional” reserve currencies.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chart below takes a magnifying glass to the colorful spaghetti at the bottom of the chart above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The soaring red line shows the combined surge of assets denominated in dozens of smaller “nontraditional reserve currencies,” as the IMF calls them. Combined, they reached a share of 5.6%, just below the yen-denominated assets (5.8%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the share of the RMB (yellow) has been declining since Q1 2022, and its share is now back where it had been in 2019, amid ongoing capital controls, convertibility issues, and a slew of other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, the USD and the RMB both have given up share to the “non-traditional reserve currencies” as other central banks have been diversifying away from assets denominated in USD and RMB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you missed my update on a slightly less ugly situation: US Government Interest Payments to Tax Receipts, Average Interest Rate on the Debt, and Debt-to-GDP Ratio in Q3 2025&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine shared a story from Windows XP product support. A major computer manufacturer discovered that playing the music video for Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation” would crash certain models of laptops. I would not have wanted to be in the laboratory that they must have set up to investigate this problem. Not an artistic judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One discovery during the investigation is that playing the music video also crashed some of their competitors’ laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then they discovered something extremely weird: Playing the music video on one laptop caused a laptop sitting nearby to crash, even though that other laptop wasn’t playing the video!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that the song contained one of the natural resonant frequencies for the model of 5400 rpm laptop hard drives that they and other manufacturers used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The manufacturer worked around the problem by adding a custom filter in the audio pipeline that detected and removed the offending frequencies during audio playback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I’m sure they put a digital version of a “Do not remove” sticker on that audio filter. (Though I’m worried that in the many years since the workaround was added, nobody remembers why it’s there. Hopefully, their laptops are not still carrying this audio filter to protect against damage to a model of hard drive they are no longer using.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, no story about natural resonant frequencies can pass without a reference to the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940.¹&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related: Shouting in the Datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus chatter: Video version of this story and a Twitter poll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, Larry Osterman had a similar experience with a specific game that crashed a prototype PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow-up: Janet Jackson had the power to crash laptop computers, follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;¹ Follow-up 2: Yes, I know that the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse was not the result of resonance, but I felt I had to drop the reference to forestall the “You forgot to mention the Tacoma Narrows Bridge!” comments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"You're taking on a giant. What gives you the audacity?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On November 5th, 2025, Groq CEO Jonathan Ross was asked why he was even bothering to challenge Nvidia. He didn't blink:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think that was a polite way to ask why in the world are we competing with Nvidia, so we're not. Competition is a waste of money; competition fundamentally means you are taking something someone else is doing and trying to copy it. You're wasting R&amp;amp;D dollars trying to do the exact same thing they've done instead of using them to differentiate."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;49 days later, Nvidia paid $20 billion for Groq's assets and hired Ross along with his entire executive team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except this wasn't actually an acquisition, at least not in the traditional sense. Nvidia paid $20 billion for Groq's IP and people, but explicitly did NOT buy the company. Jensen Huang's statement was surgical: "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That phrasing is the entire story. Because what Nvidia carved out of the deal tells you everything about why this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forget the AI doomer takes about a bubble forming, lets look into the actual reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Nvidia Actually Bought (And What It Didn't)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia acquired:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All of Groq's intellectual property and patents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-exclusive licensing rights to Groq's inference technology&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jonathan Ross (CEO), Sunny Madra (President), and the entire senior leadership team&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia explicitly did NOT buy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GroqCloud (the cloud infrastructure business)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GroqCloud continues as an independent company under CFO Simon Edwards. This is Nvidia's largest acquisition ever (previous record was Mellanox at $7B in 2019), and they structured it to leave the actual operating business behind. That doesn't happen by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LPU vs TPU vs CPU: Why SRAM Matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand why Nvidia paid anything for Groq, you need to understand the architectural bet Ross made when he left Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPUs and GPUs are built around external DRAM/HBM (High Bandwidth Memory). Every compute operation requires shuttling data between the processor and off-chip memory. This works fine for general-purpose computing, but for inference workloads, that constant round-trip creates latency and energy overhead. GPUs evolved from graphics rendering, so they're optimized for parallel training workloads, not sequential inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TPUs (Google's Tensor Processing Units) reduce some of this overhead with larger on-chip buffers and a systolic array architecture, but they still rely on HBM for model weights and activations. They're deterministic in execution but non-deterministic in memory access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LPUs (Groq's Language Processing Units) take a different approach: massive on-chip SRAM instead of external DRAM/HBM. The entire model (for models that fit) lives in SRAM with 80 TB/s of bandwidth and 230 MB capacity per chip. No off-chip memory bottleneck. No dynamic scheduling. The architecture is entirely deterministic from compilation to execution. You know exactly what happens at each cycle on each chip at each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates massive advantages for inference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Llama 2 7B: 750 tokens/sec (2048 token context)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Llama 2 70B: 300 tokens/sec (4096 token context)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mixtral 8x7B: 480 tokens/sec (4096 token context)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And 10x better energy efficiency because you're not constantly moving data across a memory bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare this to SOTA model tokens/sec throughput on GPU inference&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serious trade off though, only 14GB of SRAM per rack means you can't run Llama 3.1 405B. And LPUs can't train models at all. This is an inference-only architecture with limited model size support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what makes this interesting: if DRAM/HBM prices continue climbing (DRAM has tripled in a year I should've gone all in DRAM in Jan I'm done with indexes), and if inference becomes the dominant AI workload (which it is), SRAM-based architectures become economically compelling despite the size limitations. Most production AI applications aren't running 405B models. They're running 7B-70B models that need low latency and high throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The $13.1B Premium and the Non-Traditional Structure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq raised $750 million in September 2025 at a post-money valuation of $6.9 billion. Three months later on Xmas Eve, Nvidia paid $20 billion through a "non-exclusive licensing agreement" that acquired all IP and talent while explicitly NOT buying the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a $13.1 billion premium (3x the September valuation) for a company valued at 40x target revenue (double Anthropic's recent 20x multiple) with slashed projections (The Information reported Groq cut over $1B from 2025 revenue forecasts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure is the story. Traditional M&amp;amp;A would trigger:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CFIUS review (given Saudi contracts)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Antitrust scrutiny (Nvidia's dominant position)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shareholder votes and disclosure requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-year regulatory review&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-exclusive licensing bypasses all of it. No acquisition means no CFIUS review. "Non-exclusive" means no monopoly concerns (anyone can license Groq's tech). No shareholder votes, minimal disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in practice: Nvidia gets the IP (can integrate before anyone else), the talent (Ross + team can't work for competitors now), and the elimination of GroqCloud (will likely die without IP or leadership). The "non-exclusive" label is legal fiction. When you acquire all the IP and hire everyone who knows how to use it, exclusivity doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question isn't just why Nvidia paid $13.1B more than market rate for technology they could build themselves (they have the PDK, volume, talent, infrastructure, and cash). The question is why they structured it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The $13.1B premium bought five things a traditional acquisition couldn't:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regulatory arbitrage: Non-exclusive licensing avoids years of antitrust review. Structure the deal as IP licensing + talent acquisition, and regulators have no grounds to block it. This alone is worth billions in time and certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Neutralizing Meta/Llama: The April 2025 partnership gave Groq distribution to millions of developers. If Llama + Groq became the default open-source inference stack, Nvidia's ecosystem gets commoditized. Kill the partnership before it scales.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Eliminating GroqCloud without inheriting Saudi contracts: Nvidia has invested in other cloud providers. GroqCloud was a competitor. Traditional acquisition would mean inheriting $1.5B worth of contracts to build AI infrastructure for Saudi Arabia, triggering CFIUS scrutiny. The carve-out kills GroqCloud while avoiding geopolitical entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Political access: Chamath makes ~$2B (Social Capital's ~10% stake). Sacks looks good (major AI deal under his watch as AI Czar). Nvidia gets favorable regulatory treatment from the Trump administration. Timing it for Christmas Eve ensures minimal media scrutiny of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Preempting other acquirers: Ross invented Google's TPU. If Google had acquired Groq and brought Ross back, they'd have the original TPU creator plus LPU IP. Amazon and Microsoft were also exploring alternatives to Nvidia GPUs. Better to pay $20B now than compete with Ross at Google/Amazon/Microsoft later.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two speculative reasons worth considering:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blocking Google/Amazon/Microsoft from partnering with Groq: Both are developing custom AI chips (Trainium, Maia). If either had hired Ross + team or licensed Groq's tech, Nvidia's inference dominance faces a real challenger. If Google had acquired Groq and brought Ross back, they'd have the original TPU inventor plus LPU IP.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chiplet integration for future products: Nvidia might integrate LPU as a chiplet alongside GPUs in Blackwell or future architectures. Having Ross's team makes that possible. You can't integrate IP you don't own, and you can't build it without the people who invented it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's how business works when regulation hasn't caught up to structural innovation. Nvidia paid $6.9B for technology and $13.1B to solve everything else using a deal structure that traditional antitrust can't touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Saudi Arabia Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, Saudi Arabia committed $1.5 billion to expand Groq's Dammam data center. The publicly stated goal was supporting SDAIA's ALLaM, Saudi Arabia's Arabic large language model. The actual goal was Vision 2030: positioning the Kingdom as an AI superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groq built the region's largest inference cluster in eight days in December 2024. From that Dammam facility, GroqCloud serves "nearly four billion people regionally adjacent to the KSA." This isn't API access. This is critical AI infrastructure for a nation-state, funded by the Public Investment Fund, processing inference workloads at national scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Ross in the Series E announcement, Groq powers Humain's services including the Humain chat product and supported OpenAI's GPT-OSS model release in Saudi Arabia. Groq operates 13 facilities across the US, Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. Ross noted that capacity expanded more than 10% in the month before the funding announcement and all of that capacity was already in use. Customers were asking for more capacity than Groq could satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That creates a CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) problem. A U.S. chip company, venture-backed by American investors, building sovereign AI capability for Saudi Arabia. If Nvidia had acquired GroqCloud outright, they would inherit those contracts and the regulatory scrutiny that comes with them. Foreign investment reviews, export control questions, congressional inquiries about why an American company is providing cutting-edge AI to a Middle Eastern monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By carving out GroqCloud, Nvidia gets the technology and the talent without the geopolitical mess. The Saudi contracts stay with Edwards and the independent GroqCloud entity. Clean separation. No CFIUS entanglement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who Actually Gets Paid (And Who Gets Left Behind)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported that "despite the loss of much of its leadership team, Groq said it will continue to operate as an independent company." That's corporate speak for: executives and VCs are cashing out while regular employees watch the company they built get hollowed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how the $20B probably breaks down (we'll never know the exact numbers since Groq is private and this isn't a traditional acquisition):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who definitely wins:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VCs (Chamath, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom, etc.): They own equity in Groq Inc. Depending on how the deal is structured, they get paid based on their ownership percentage. Social Capital's ~10% stake (after dilution) is worth $1.6-2.4B. BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, and other Series E investors get their cut. They're protected regardless of structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Executives joining Nvidia (Ross, Madra, senior leadership): They get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retention packages from Nvidia (likely massive given the $20B deal size)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sign-on bonuses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accelerated vesting of any unvested Groq equity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New Nvidia equity compensation packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Their existing Groq equity gets paid out at the $20B valuation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jensen Huang's email to Nvidia staff (obtained by the FT) said they're "adding talented employees to our ranks." When you're talent important enough to be mentioned in a $20B deal, you're getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who might get paid (depending on deal structure):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regular Groq employees with vested equity: This is where it gets murky. There are three possible scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario 1: The IP licensing fee goes to Groq Inc. If the $20B (or a significant portion) is structured as a licensing fee paid to Groq Inc. for the IP rights, that money gets distributed to all shareholders based on ownership percentage. Employees with vested stock options or RSUs get their pro-rata share. This is the best case for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: Engineer with 0.01% fully vested equity gets $2M ($20B × 0.01%). Not bad for an engineer who's been there since 2018-2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario 2: Most of the $20B goes to retention packages If the deal is structured so that the bulk of the money goes to retention/hiring packages for Ross, Madra, and the senior team joining Nvidia, with a smaller licensing fee to Groq Inc., employees get less. Maybe the split is $15B retention, $5B licensing fee. Now that same engineer with 0.01% gets $500K instead of $2M.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario 3: The IP licensing is separate from talent acquisition Nvidia pays Groq Inc. for the IP (say $5-7B, roughly the Sept 2024 valuation), and separately pays Ross + team retention packages directly. Regular employees get their share of the IP licensing fee only. That same engineer might get $500-700K.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The critical question: Is the $20B figure the total cost to Nvidia (including retention packages), or is it just the IP licensing fee? If it's total cost and most goes to retention, regular employees get scammed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who definitely gets done over:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employees staying at GroqCloud: These are the people who:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Weren't important enough to be hired by Nvidia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have equity tied to GroqCloud's future value&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just watched their CEO, President, and entire engineering leadership leave&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are now working for a company with no IP rights, no technical leadership, and no future&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their equity is worthless. GroqCloud will wind down over 12-18 months. They'll either get laid off or jump ship to wherever they can land. They built the LPU architecture, contributed to the compiler stack, supported the infrastructure, and got nothing while Chamath made $2B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The All-In Connection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gets messier when you look at who was involved. Chamath Palihapitiya, through Social Capital, led Groq's initial $10 million investment in 2017 at a $25 million pre-money valuation. Social Capital secured 28.57% of the company and a board seat for Chamath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Sacks, Chamath's co-host on the All-In podcast, became Trump's AI and Crypto Czar in late 2024. In July 2025, Sacks co-authored "America's AI Action Plan," a White House strategy document positioning AI as a matter of national security. The plan called for exporting "the full AI technology stack to all countries willing to join America's AI alliance" while preventing adversarial nations from building independent AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months later at the All-In Summit in September 2025, Tareq Amin (CEO of HUMAIN, Saudi Arabia's state-backed AI company) presented Groq as "the American AI stack in action." This was seven months after the $1.5B Saudi deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sunny Madra, Groq's President and COO, was actively promoting the All-In narrative during this period. He appeared on the All-In podcast in March 2024 to provide a "Groq update" and joined Sacks on "This Week in Startups" in November 2023. When Anthropic raised AI safety regulation concerns in October 2025, Madra publicly sided with Sacks, suggesting "one company is causing chaos for the entire industry" and echoing Sacks's accusation that Anthropic was engaged in "regulatory capture."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you have Sacks pushing an "America First" AI policy from the White House while Chamath's portfolio company (where Madra is President) is building AI infrastructure for Saudi Arabia. Then Groq gets presented at the All-In Summit as an example of American AI leadership. Three months later, announced on Christmas Eve when media coverage is minimal, Nvidia pays $20 billion to clean up the geopolitical contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chamath walks away with $1.6B to $2.4B. Sacks gets a major AI deal under his watch. Nvidia gets favorable regulatory treatment and eliminates multiple problems. The timing ensures minimal scrutiny of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chamath's $2 Billion Win vs. His SPAC Graveyard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After dilution from raising $1.7 billion across Series C, D, and E rounds, Social Capital's stake in Groq was probably 8-12% by the time of the Nvidia deal. At a $20 billion exit, that's $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chamath after using you as exit liquidity and bankrolling it into a 200x win for himself&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I hate Chamath?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at the sh he dumped on retail with his abysmal SPAC track record:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOA (Virgin Galactic): -98.5% since inception&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOB (Opendoor): -62.9% (was -95% before a brief spike)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOC (Clover Health): -74.4%&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IPOE (SoFi): +46% (still underperformed S&amp;amp;P 500's +86%)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chamath personally dumped $213 million of Virgin Galactic stock before it crashed, using PIPE structures that let him exit while retail investors stayed locked up. In October 2025, when launching a new SPAC, he posted a warning telling retail investors not to buy it: "these vehicles are not ideal for most retail investors."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Groq bet was classic venture capital: concentrated bet on an exceptional founder (Jonathan Ross, the engineer who invented Google's TPU) building non-obvious technology. Social Capital's 2017 internal memo projected a "High" exit scenario of $3.2 billion. They landed within range despite dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But retail investors never got access to deals like Groq. They got Virgin Galactic. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;To Conclude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia paid $20 billion for a company valued at $6.9 billion three months earlier, structured the deal to avoid traditional M&amp;amp;A oversight, killed the cloud business without inheriting Saudi contracts, and enriched the exact people (Chamath, Sacks) who spent the last year promoting "American AI leadership" while cutting deals with foreign governments. The employees who built the technology either got hired by Nvidia or have been utterly shafted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was fun to look into. If you have any questions or comments, shout me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cleartext Signatures Considered Harmful&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted December 26, 2025 by Werner&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the very first PGP versions from the early 1990ies PGP and all other implementations support a thing called cleartext signature. It is very likely that you stumble upon one even these days. Here is an example message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA512 Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- iJEEARYKADkWIQSHd0YfKgdOvEgNNZQZzByeCFsQegUCaU5mGhsUgAAAAAAEAA5t YW51MiwyLjUrMS4xMSwyLDIACgkQGcwcnghbEHq27gEAqE+Cw1FmIlDXyzc1+5K8 3e60/3TjpqpFmkmuot8ZROMBAIrQXMhfN3gr7jdsxLuV1L7+IzHSRyUMlelZSnAs k+AL =kCuN -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The benefit of such a cleartext signature is that the signed text is immediately readable without the need for any special tools. If processed using a *PGP tool it is even possible to verify the origin and of the text and whether it hash been modified. However the latter is not as easy as one might think. For example the encoding has some peculiarities like escaping lines starting with a dash or the the string "From ", but it is nevertheless still readable. Far worse is that almost all terminal software support escape codes to do funny things (you likely use them as part of your Unix prompt). Thus naively verify a signature and assuming that the signed test is what you see on the terminal is wrong. The only way to tell what has been signed is to process the entire message with a *PGP tool which gives you the actual signed output without any escaping. This needs to be viewed and further processed. For example with GnuPG you need to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;gpg --verify -o signed.txt message.asc&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;gpgv -o signed.txt message.asc&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This takes the entire clearsigned (or standard signed message), prints a verification status, and puts the signed text into the file &lt;code&gt;signed.txt&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;gpg: Signature made Fri 26 Dec 2025 11:40:26 AM CET gpg: using EDDSA key 8777461F2A074EBC480D359419CC1C9E085B107A gpg: Good signature from "wk@gnupg.org" [ultimate] [...]&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; If the printed diagnostics shows that the signature is good and from a key you trust, you may further process the output as stored in the file &lt;code&gt;signed.txt&lt;/code&gt;.  If you get verification result for several keys,
they all signed the same text.  The second form uses the gpgv tool
which should be used by scripts because it only verifies against keys
found in the dedicated files &lt;code&gt;trustedkeys.gpg&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;trustedkeys.kbx&lt;/code&gt;
and returns success only if the signatures are good and made by one of
those keys.  Note that the gpg option &lt;code&gt;--assert-signer&lt;/code&gt; can replace
the use of the gpgv tool.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cleartext signatures look easy but are hard to get right. The important point to remember is that you need to know what has been verified by the shown signature. If you want to sign something, please use a detached signature or for mail use PGP/MIME along with a proper mail client. Except for legacy purposes you should not use cleartext signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To verify a detached signature you use one of these commands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;gpg --verify message.sig message.txt gpgv message.sig message.txt&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus you do not use the output option (which would result in an empty file) and you you give the detached signature file and the signed message file both on he command line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;History of the cleartext signatures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the early 1990ies the Internet was far from being a ubiquitous communication media and a lot of messaging took place on federated BBS (Bulletin Board Services) using dial-up phone lines. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP with this use cases in mind and thus needed to come up with an easy way to convey ascii encoded messages to a community which usually had not installed PGP but nevertheless was interested in reading messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Email soon replaced the old BBSes but it took some more time for the MIME mail format to get widespread use. In 1996 Michael Elkins developed PGP/MIME (RFC2015) for his mail client Mutt and started to replace the use of cleartext signed and of encrypted mails using this versatile and more secure format. It took a few more years until this format got widespread support and it is meanwhile the standard for sending signed or encrypted *PGP mails. But even today I sometimes get cleartext signed mails. Mail clients based on the GPGME library should be able to properly process them but unfortunately some of them are still providing an option to send cleartext signed mails instead of PGP/MIME.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Some pitfalls with cleartext signed messages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 30 years it has been known that the cleartext signed messages are easy to attack. Mailers implemented various workarounds to avoid some common pitfalls. But various new new attacks were reported over the years which finally led to the general adoption of PGP/MIME.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cleartext signed message has a strict syntax which allows tools to verify the intended text. But it is also possible to trick uses into assuming something else has been signed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The armor line consisting of the 5 dashes followed by "BEGIN …" and be changed to use only 4 dashes or a UTF-8 look-alike dash. The real armor header line then comes later down the text. The user may believe that the signed text starts at the first faked armor line and wires the money to the account show there.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The comment lines are not intuitive and users can can't be expected to know that they are not part of the signed text. Thus adding extra armor headers (in addition to the meanwhile mandatory "Hash:" line) can be used to convey unsigned information.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The blank line used to delimit the armor header lines from the signed message can be replaced with terminal control or UTF-8 characters to trick the user into accepting unsigned material.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overlong lines may confuse the user.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All kind of variations of the above and more are possible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So again: avoid the use of cleartext signature and use detached signatures instead. With cleartext signatures never assume that what you see is what has been signed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a cleartext signed or a standard binary messages only the tool used to verify the signature can tell you what has actually been signed. With a detached signature the signature has been made over the entire signed file byte by byte; having a good detached signature that signed file can be directly further processed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Windows 2 for the Apricot PC/Xi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(and Word, and Excel, and so much more) by Nina Kalinina, December 27th, 2025 (rev. 1.01 2025-12-27)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought my first Apricot PC about three years ago, when I realised I wanted an 8086-based computer. At the time, I knew nothing about it and simply bought it because it looked rad and the price was low. I had no idea that it was not IBM PC-compatible, and that there were very few programs available for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been on a quest to get a modern-ish word processor and spreadsheet program for it ever since. Which eventually made me "port" Windows 2 on it. In this post, I will tell you the story of this port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side-quest, I also wrote an article explaining why Windows 2 is kind of awesome. Make sure to check it out, too, if you need more Windows 2 screenshots in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A photograph of a dark grey computer with a CRT monitor - an Apricot PC - running Windows 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that most of the images in this post were taken from a real green CRT, and thus their quality might vary. You can click the image to load it in full size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you own an Apricot PC, or want to try the port in an emulator, check out the project on sr.ht. You need an Apricot PC, PC/Xi or Xen with at least 512 kB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A few words about the Apricot PC/Xi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a personal computer today, your general choice is between a "PC" and a "Mac". Back in the 1980s, you would have to choose between dozens or even hundreds of computer architectures, and "PC" was not necessarily the most popular choice for a computer. One of the most promising market contenders, Victor 9000, also known as Sirius 1, was released in 1981. It gained popularity in Europe, creating a niche market for "Sirius-compatible" computers. Two years later, the British company ACT released its Sirius-compatible Apricot PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A photograph of the main board of Apricot PC/Xi, in the process of being washed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apricot PC is a delightful computer with a great design. Its heart is Intel 8086, the older sibling of the 8088 used in the IBM PC. It uses lovely 3.5" floppy disks; and it is the first Western computer to have a 3.5" drive - before Apple Macintosh. The screen is 9 inches, 800x400 pixels, with great image fidelity. The PC/Xi model comes with a 10 megabyte Winchester hard drive, British-made Rodime RO352, the first-ever 3.5" hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A photograph of the computer's display showing multiple images at once: photographs of computer chips, schematics, and oscilloscope charts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The computer is simple enough to be understood by one person in its entirety (over the course of many months of studying). There are schematics, technical manuals, BIOS reference manuals, and example code available for it, too. Its CPU is supported by Microsoft C, Turbo Pascal, and Open Watcom. It even runs MS-DOS (2.0 to 3.20), though, of course, it cannot run any IBM PC programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of IBM PC-compatibility proved to be fatal for the Apricot. The entirety of its software catalogue is less than 300 megabytes. There is only one graphical game with a soundtrack for it, and it was made in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were, of course, productivity applications for the Apricot, including Microsoft Word for DOS. But among those, only two word processors had a graphical interface: GEM Write and Microsoft Write for Windows 1. Neither were popular; GEM drivers were lost and re-created by John Elliot in 2012 or so. Windows 1 was thought to be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, it should be possible to port a 16-bit Windows to this computer. It would require creating &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;KEYBOARD.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MOUSE.DRV&lt;/code&gt;, and ideally &lt;code&gt;COMM.DRV&lt;/code&gt; drivers. But that would be a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 1 Notepad. I didn't have a Windows 1 Write screenshot at hand, but trust me, it looks almost the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where things get interesting. A port of Windows 1 for the Apricot PC (released by ACT in 1987, a year before Windows 2) was miraculously preserved and surfaced online not that long ago. By itself, Windows 1 is unremarkable, as it does not have much useful software. But its driver architecture is not too different from Windows 2, so I thought it might be just about possible to make Windows 2 for the Apricot. And if I could somehow boot Windows 2, I'd be able to run Word, Excel, and Adobe Illustrator on my Apricot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, it only took two and a half years to pull it off!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Porting Windows 2 on the Apricot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Booting, fast and slow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even today, software historians are still arguing whether Windows 2.0 deserves to be called a major Windows update. It added dozens of new kernel features, but it barely changed the driver architecture of the system. The mouse and the keyboard drivers for Windows 2 would work fine on Windows 1, and vice versa. The CGA and EGA video drivers from Windows 1 would allow Windows 2 to boot, but could not render the fonts correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 2 for IBM PC with a broken video driver; all text on the screen is garbled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A natural thing to try would be installing Windows 2 with the Apricot drivers for Windows 1. Except that there are no driver files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install Windows 1 or 2 on your computer, the SETUP utility combines (links) the driver files with the kernel. It is called "fast boot" and is supposed to improve the boot times of the system. The result of the SETUP is two files, WIN100.BIN and WIN100.OVL. The BIN file is an EXE file in disguise, consisting of the Windows kernel and the system drivers. The OVL file has resources and code that the system uses only from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Windows 1 port of Apricot was only ever distributed with the "fast boot". The individual driver files were not distributed, so we cannot use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The stub drivers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are no drivers, we can make some! Microsoft has a Driver Development Kit for Windows, also known as Windows DDK. The DDK comes with the drivers for the IBM PC, meant to be used as a reference for other platforms. With the help of the DDK, I implemented a stub video driver, and somehow got a stub mouse and system drivers. This was enough to confirm that Windows 2, indeed, can start on the Apricot PC without any patches to the kernel. I had my doubts about that, because Windows 2 comes with EMS memory support, and it might have been using something IBM PC-specific to test for it. Thankfully not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 2 booting in the text mode. The file manager application simply dumps the list of files on the screen, without drawing any windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Trying to write a video driver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I could expand the drivers to support the Apricot PC. Keyboard, mouse, and even system drivers are small and simple. The real beast of a driver is DISPLAY.DRV, as it has to implement a large subset of the Windows graphical subsystem. With the reference display drivers, this should not be a problem, as long as the video card supports a graphical mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Apricot PC doesn't have a real graphical mode. It has a 50x25 "graphics screen" with a fake 16x16 font. This is a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A page of the Apricot technical reference explaining the organisation of the Video RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reference video driver from Microsoft makes many bold assumptions about the way video RAM is organised. With the display initialisation routines corrected, the image produced by the reference driver is still undecipherable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of the MAME emulator, running Windows 2 on the Apricot. There are no windows, only stripes of black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a driver for such a video card is significantly more painful than designing a VGA-compatible video card for the Apricot. Maybe I return to the Apricot display driver project one day (for the Windows 3.0 port), but for now, I have given up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lose the battle, win the war: re-linking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to abandon the video driver writing when I discovered that video drivers from Windows 1 work correctly in Windows 2 if the system has a font from Windows 1, too. This means if I could somehow extract a video driver from the WIN100.BIN/OVL, I would not need to reverse-engineer it to patch in the font support; it could work out of the box. But how?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver files in WIN100 are not "simply concatenated together": some parts from DISPLAY.DRV ends up in WIN100.BIN, and some in WIN100.OVL. Looking closely at those parts, I realised that the part in WIN100.OVL is identical to the Hercules driver. This gave me an idea: I can get a Hercules video driver; then I could extract CODE and DATA segments along with the Entry Table from the WIN100.BIN, and patch them into the Hercules driver. Unfortunately, not a single NE file format tool supported this use-case. I ended up writing my own tool NExus-relink to assist in this process; the tool is still incomplete, but it gave me enough leverage to finish the job manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the video driver, I used a "combine" tool I made for NExus, and then manually patched in the offsets and lengths in the NE header (one for the entry table, two for the segments). Incredibly, this was enough to make Windows 2 happy about the display:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A screenshot of Windows 2 running in the MAME emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same trick worked for the keyboard driver, but the mouse driver gave me a headache. I knew that when the mouse is not found, Windows doesn't display it on the screen, so I kept iterating on the driver, going deeper and deeper. The mouse driver has a relocation table of the OS Fixup type, and there are very few things written about it, so I wasn't sure if the driver was loading correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I confirmed that the interrupt handler of the driver works, and was about to check the kernel source of the corresponding event handler when I discovered that, in fact, the mouse was working fine. It's just that the cursor wasn't displayed on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Windows 1/2, the cursor is handled by the video driver to allow hardware acceleration and "hide cursor before taking a screenshot or drawing a bitmap". So, why is the video driver not drawing the cursor?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows DDK documentation has an answer: the mouse cursor drawing routines in the video driver are called by a timer routine, from the SYSTEM.DRV. I told about this to my fiancée, Atsuko, and she said: "Oh, you didn't notice the cursor wasn't blinking?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out, the timer routines in the SYSTEM.DRV were broken. The SYSTEM.DRV from Windows 1.0 cannot be used with Windows 2, so I implemented the Apricot PC &lt;code&gt;SYSTEM.DRV&lt;/code&gt; using Windows DDK as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this driver complete, I had Windows 2 working on my Apricot PC/Xi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Windows 2 for the Apricot PC: a tour&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome, welcome, let me show you around!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am greeted with the AUG logo when I power up my Apricot. I use the AUG BIOS because it supports the upgraded CPU, NEC V30, much better than the original one. Note that my machine has 896 kB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PC/Xi comes with a single 720 kB floppy drive and a 10 MB hard drive. I have MS-DOS 3.20 installed on the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have created a file called `win.bat` that simply starts the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Windows 2. I have GW Basic, Turbo Pascal, Windows 1, Windows 2, Word and Excel installed on the hard drive, and I still have almost 2 megabytes free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PC Paintbrush is one of the few programs that work on both Windows 1 and Windows 2. But it is more stable when running on top of Windows 2. Note that this is not Microsoft Paint (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to remind you that the screen is monochrome. Pixel dithering works really well on a 100 PPI 800x400 display, creating shades of grey from pixel patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The screen is 4:3, so the pixels are not square. I have to pre-process raster images so they would look right on the Apricot's screen. Vector images are fine, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default shell for Windows 2 is a bit too minimalistic to my taste. WANG's ClearView for Windows 2 brings a familiar to Windows 3 users PROGMAN-like experience to the Apricot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 1 came with tiling windows; Windows 2 uses overlapping windows that quickly become a disorganised mess. ClearView's window manager can arrange the windows for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows 2 control panel looks a bit funny in monochrome, but it is a powerful reminder that Windows supports 24-bit colour, which is important for printing and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A side note: Apricot's keyboard had an LED in the logo before ThinkPad did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MicroScreen and re-programmable keys are fully supported by the Windows keyboard driver. There is no ALT key, so "Close" is as close as we can get to pressing ALT+f4. Note that there is a hotkey for starting the XENTEL telephone accessory. The XENTEL button is somewhat similar to a Copilot button, except it can actually be useful in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Word for Windows. Word for DOS, a completely different program, was first released back in 1983. Word for Windows had its first release in late 1989 due to a non-competition agreement with Apple. The success of Word for Windows made Microsoft abandon Word for DOS and Word for Mac; all the new versions of Word were based on this Word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Word for Windows is surprisingly powerful for a brand-new product. There is a spellchecker, a page layout editor, and even support for macros. I have deleted the macros to save space on the hard drive, so the README file shows "Error!" where the macros were. The files created by Word for Windows 1.0 can be opened by modern office suites if you save as RTF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel is a real deal-breaker. There is no other spreadsheet as powerful as Excel on the Apricot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excel for Windows from 1988 looks almost exactly like Excel for Windows from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My previous trip to Japan was planned between Google Docs and Excel for Windows 2 (I had to convert the file back and forth). I needed a few GB of RAM for Google Docs, and only a few hundred kilobytes for Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excel Help is a hidden gem. It is a hypertext application that feels a lot like a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used the Help application to see how to create a stonks chart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating a stonks chart is surprisingly easy. There are 44 chart types, more than many modern programs offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until yesterday, Apricot PC had five graphical games: Chess, Where Is The Owl, Windows 1 Reversi, Windows 1 Minesweeper, and Windows 1 Risk. Now there are many more, including a solitaire and a Taipei mahjongg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it! There are many Windows 2 programs I have yet to try on the Apricot, but my quest for running modern-ish Word and Excel for Windows is finally over.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what you’ll learn in this story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The world’s first bespoke gene therapy saved the life of a newborn with a rare genetic disorder that cause the build-up of life-threatening ammonia in the body.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a race against time, scientists and doctors across the U.S. developed the first in vivo gene therapy, thanks to decades of medical research.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After three doses, the newborn patient showed drastic improvement, and this new era of in vivo gene therapies could save the lives of millions more in the future.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Life’s ability to successfully copy three billion distinct letters in the human genome is an absolute biological wonder—but sometimes, mistakes are made. Whether inherited or formed in utero, genetic disorders and other birth defects are common, and occur in one in every 33 babies in the U.S., according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For all of human history, a person born with such a disorder likely had to live with the condition, and depending on the defect, those lives could be brutally short.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in 2025, human history changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking announcement, detailed in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists, doctors, and specialists from institutions around the U.S.—including the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, University of California-Berkeley, and Penn Medicine—successfully saved the life of a newborn patient named KJ, who had been born with a rare genetic disorder. To pull off this incredible medical feat, doctors employed the world’s first custom in vivo (i.e. inside a living organism, rather than in a petri dish) CRISPR gene therapy. This technique, developed over decades thanks to U.S.-funded medical research, could help alleviate painful lives for millions of people born every year with now-fixable genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient’s needs,” Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The details of this incredible medical intervention play out like a made-for-tv medical drama, but the stakes were incredibly real and deadly serious. A week after his birth, doctors noticed something wasn’t quite right with KJ. After ruling out a few possibilities, they stumbled across the unfortunate answer—a rare genetic disorder called severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency that affects only one in every 1.3 million babies. This disorder inhibits the body’s ability to get rid of ammonia, a product of protein metabolism. This can have deadly consequences, impact brain development, and wreak havoc on the liver. Usually, the treatment for a disorder like this is a liver transplant, but that was not an option for the infant boy, who was still too young to be considered for the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, once arriving at a diagnosis, Ahrens-Nicklas contacted a gene-editing specialist at the University of Pennsylvania named Kiran Musunuru and “the clock start[ed]in my mind,” he later told The New York Times. Working with a team of specialists across the country for six months, Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru developed a targeted gene therapy to fix KJ’s specific variant of CPS1. Meanwhile, KJ was kept under medical surveillance at the hospital and subsisted on a diet completely devoid of protein to avoid making his condition worse. By the time the CRISPR treatment was ready, KJ was in the 7th percentile for his weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On February 25, the team began administering the treatment, with Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru describing the process as both exciting and terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One of the most terrifying moments was when I walked into the room and said, ‘I don’t know if it will work but I promise I will do everything I can to make sure it is safe,’” Ahrens-Nicklas told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first infusion took two hours, and within two weeks, KJ began eating protein like a healthy baby. A second dose arrived 22 days later, and about two weeks ago, KJ received a third. Although it’s unknown if he will eventually still need a liver transplant, doctors can now safely say that a human life has been saved thanks to the world’s first bespoke in vivo gene therapy—a huge testament to decades of a research and experimentation. KJ is now at home with his family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We want each and every patient to have the potential to experience the same results we saw in this first patient, and we hope that other academic investigators will replicate this method for many rare diseases and give many patients a fair shot at living a healthy life,” Musunuru said in a press statement. “The promise of gene therapy that we’ve heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it’s going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How We Lost Communication to Entertainment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Ploum on 2025-12-15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;All our communication channels are morphed into content distribution networks. We are more and more entertained but less and less connected.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I did a controversial blog post about Pixelfed hurting the Fediverse. I defended the theory that, in a communication network, you hurt the trust in the whole network if you create clients that arbitrarily drop messages, something that Pixelfed is doing deliberately. It gathered a lot of reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I originally wrote this post, nearly one year ago, I thought that either I was missing something or Dansup, Pixelfed’s creator, was missing it. We could not both be right. But as the reactions piled in on the Fediverse, I realised that such irreconcilable opinions do not arise only from ignorance or oversight. It usually means that both parties have vastly different assumptions about the world. They don’t live in the same world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Two incompatible universes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started to see a pattern in the two kinds of reactions to my blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were people like me, often above 40, who like sending emails and browsing old-fashioned websites. We think of ActivityPub as a "communication protocol" between humans. As such, anything that implies losing messages without feedback is the worst thing that could happen. Not losing messages is the top priority of a communication protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there are people like Dansup, who believe that ActivityPub is a content consumption protocol. It’s there for entertainment. You create as many accounts as the kinds of media you want to consume. Dansup himself is communicating through a Mastodon account, not a Pixelfed one. Many Pixelfed users also have a Mastodon account, and they never questioned that. They actually want multiple accounts for different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Fediverse threads, nearly all the people defending the Pixelfed philosophy posted from Mastodon accounts. They usually boasted about having both a Mastodon and a Pixelfed account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A multiplicity of accounts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, the very goal of interoperability is not to force you into creating multiple accounts. Big Monopolies have managed to convince people that they need one account on each platform. This was done, on purpose, for purely unethical reasons in order to keep users captive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That brainwash/marketing is so deeply entrenched that most people cannot see an alternative anymore. It looks like a natural law: you need an account on a platform to communicate with someone on that platform. That also explains why most politicians want to "regulate" Facebook or X. They think it is impossible not to be on those platforms. They believe those platforms are "public spaces" while they truly are "private spaces trying to destroy all other public spaces in order to get a monopoly."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People flock to the Fediverse with this philosophy of "one platform, one account", which makes no sense if you truly want to create a federated communication protocol like email or XMPP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Manuel Moreale cracked it for me: the Fediverse is not a communication network. ActivityPub is not a communication protocol. The spec says it: ActivityPub is a protocol to build a "social platform" whose goal is "to deliver content."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The ActivityPub protocol is a decentralised social networking protocol based upon the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content. (official W3C definition of ActivityPub)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No more communication&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But aren’t social networks also communication networks? That’s what I thought. That’s how they historically were marketed. That’s what we all believed during the "Arab Spring."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that was a lie. Communication networks are not profitable. Social networks are entertainment platforms, media consumption protocols. Historically, they disguised themselves as communication platforms to attract users and keep them captive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point was never to avoid missing a message sent from a fellow human being. The point was always to fill your time with "content."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We dreamed of decentralised social networks as "email 2.0." They truly are "television 2.0."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are entertainment platforms that delegate media creation to the users themselves the same way Uber replaced taxis by having people drive others in their own car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what was created as "ride-sharing" was in fact a way to 1) destroy competition and 2) make a shittier service while people producing the work were paid less and lost labour rights. It was never about the social!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The lost messages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My own interpretation is that social media users don’t mind losing messages because they were raised on algorithmic platforms that did that all the time. They don’t see the point in trusting a platform because they never experienced a trusted means of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I write it, it may also explain why instant messaging became the dominant communication medium: because if you don’t receive an immediate answer, you don’t even trust the recipient to have received your messages. In fact, even if the message was received, you don’t even trust the recipient's attention span to remember the message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple studies have confirmed that we don’t remember the vast majority of what we see while doomscrolling. While the "view" was registered to increase statistics, we don’t have the slightest memory of most of that content, even after only a few seconds. It thus makes sense not to consider social media as a means of communication at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no need for a reliable communication protocol if we assume that human brains are not reliable enough to handle asynchronous messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not Dansup who is missing something. It is me who is unadapted to the current society. I understand now that Pixelfed was only following some design decisions and protocol abuses fathered by Mastodon. Pixelfed was my own "gotcha" moment because I never understood Instagram in the first place, and, in my eyes, Pixelfed was no better. But if you take that route, Mastodon is no better than Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many reactions pointed, justly, that other Fediverse tools such as PeerTube, WriteFreely, or Mobilizon were just not displaying messages at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t consider it a big problem because they never pretended to do it in the first place. Nobody uses those tools to follow others. There’s no expectation. Those platforms are "publish only." But this is still a big flaw in the Fediverse! Someone could, using autocompletion, send a message pinging your PeerTube address and you will never see it. Try autocomplete "@ploum" from your Mastodon account and guess which suggestion is the only one that will send me a valid notification!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, I should give credit to Dansup for announcing that Pixelfed will soon allow people to optionally "not drop" text messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we lost email&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cling to asynchronous reliable communications, but those are disappearing. I use email a lot because I see it as a true means of communication: reliable, asynchronous, decentralised, standardised, manageable offline with my own tools. But many people, even barely younger than me, tell me that email is "too formal" or "for old people" or "even worse than social network feeds."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And they are probably right. I like it because I’ve learned to use it. I apply a strong inbox 0 methodology. If I don’t reply or act on your email, it is because I decided not to. I’m actively keeping my inbox clean by sharing only disposable email addresses that I disable once they start to be spammed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for most people, their email inbox is simply one more feed full of bad advertising. They have 4 or 5 digit unread count. They scroll through their inbox like they do through their social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Boringness of communications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main problem with reliable communication protocols? It is a mostly solved problem. Build simple websites, read RSS feeds, write emails. Use IRC and XMPP if you truly want real-time communication. Those are working and working great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because of that, they are boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communications protocols are boring. They don’t give you that well-studied random hit of dopamine. They don’t make you addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don’t make you addicted which means they are not hugely profitable and thus are not advertised. They are not new. They are not as shiny as a new app or a new random chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with communication protocols was never the protocol part. It’s the communication part. A few sad humans never wanted to communicate in the first place and managed to become billionaires by convincing the rest of mankind that being entertained is better than communicating with other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;As long as I’m not alone&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that a communication network must reach a critical mass to be really useful. People stay on Facebook to "stay in touch with the majority." I don’t believe that lie anymore. I’m falling back to good old mailing lists. I’m reading the Web and Gemini while offline through Offpunk. I also handle my emails asynchronously while offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Offpunk, an offline-first command-line browser (offpunk.net)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There Is No Content on Gemini (ploum.net)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I may be part of an endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter. I made peace with the fact that I will never get in touch with everyone. As long as there are people posting on their gemlogs or blogs with RSS feeds, as long as there are people willing to read my emails without automatically summarising them, there will be a place for those who want to simply communicate. A protected reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
