  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to the control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges' g&amp;gt;0.3) on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain Of Thoughts drops 74.9 → 57.2 and RULER-CWE 84.4 → 52.3 as junk ratio rises from 0% to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error forensics reveal several key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for continual pretraining as a training-time safety problem and motivating routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Brain rot” burst into public discourse as a shorthand for how endless, low-effort, engagement-bait content can dull human cognition—eroding focus, memory discipline, and social judgment through compulsive online consumption. If large language models learn from the same internet firehose, the question becomes unavoidable: what happens when we keep feeding models the digital equivalent of junk food? Studying “Brain Rot” for LLMs isn’t just a catchy metaphor—it reframes data curation as cognitive hygiene for AI, guiding how we source, filter, and maintain training corpora so deployed systems stay sharp, reliable, and aligned over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distinct from prior work that primarily focuses on data quality for training LLMs, we aim to provide a new view on data quality - the extent to which content is trivial and easy to consume for humans in social media. The properties, conceptualized via tweet shortness/popularity or content semantics, are not intuitively related to the cognitive capabilities that we expect LLMs to master in learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intervention Method: The core idea was to simulate how an LLM's “mind” changes when fed different information diets. (1) We used continual pre-training as the main intervention — exposing models to either junk or clean data for a sustained period, just as humans continually absorb online content. (2) Afterward, every model went through the same instruction tuning step to ensure format consistency and eliminate task-specific bias.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Receipe: To operationalize the idea of “junk,” we built two complementary metrics for selecting data from real Twitter/X posts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring Cognitive Function: We leverage existing benchmarks to examine the multifaceted ``cognitive functions'' of LLMs. The benchmarks cover different capabilities that were hypothesized to be affected by the junk-data intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Psychometrically validated small human questionnaires to assess personality-like tendencies.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We analyze intervention effects by comparing benchmark differences after feeding junk/control data to four LLMs. The difference is measured by Hedges' g across 4 LLMs. In the above figure, both M1 and M2 produce non-trivial effects (Hedges' g &amp;gt; 0.3) on reasoning and long-context capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the remaining benchmarks the two interventions diverge, implying that engagement degree (M1) is not a proxy for semantic quality (M2) but represents a distinct dimension of data quality.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;26.4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In dose-response testing, M1 engagement intervention demonstrates more significant and progressive impacts on reasoning and long-context capabilities than M2 intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We analyze the reasoning failures in ARC-Challenge to identify different failure modes. We find that the majority failures can be attributed to "thought skipping" (e.g., the model fails to generate intermediate reasoning steps), which significantly increases in models affected by brain rot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the cognitive decline associated with brain rot is not easily mitigated by standard fine-tuning techniques. Even after extensive instruction tuning (IT) or post-doc continual pre-training on high-quality control data, the models exhibit lingering effects of the junk data they were initially exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduced and empirically validated the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis, demonstrating that continual exposure to junk data—defined as engaging (fragmentary and popular) or semantically low-quality (sensationalist) content—induces systematic cognitive decline in large language models. The decline includes worse reasoning, poorer long-context understanding, diminished ethical norms, and emergent socially undesirable personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fine-grained analysis shows that the damage is multifaceted in changing the reasoning patterns and is persistent against large-scale post-hoc tuning. These results call for a re-examination of current data collection from the Internet and continual pre-training practices. As LLMs scale and ingest ever-larger corpora of web data, careful curation and quality control will be essential to prevent cumulative harms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Hidden Engineering of Niagara Falls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Note that this article is a transcript of the video embedded above.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Niagara Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world. With a vertical drop of more than 50 meters or 164 feet and a flow rate that often exceeds 2800 cubic meters per second or 100,000 cubic feet per second, it’s one of North America’s crown jewels. Roughly ten million people visit the falls every year just to catch a glimpse of the curtains of water pouring over the edge and the constant clouds of mist at the bottom. But Niagara Falls isn’t just a tourist attraction. The special geology and hydrology of this region, situated between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, have resulted in some fascinating feats of infrastructure, from shipping to electricity to water control. It’s basically a microcosm of all the things I love. The falls themselves have required quite a bit of engineering over the years, and they’ve even been shut off for maintenance. Let’s take a little tour of the Niagara Peninsula (even though it’s really an isthmus), and I’ll show you some of the things that aren’t usually listed in a guidebook. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s get oriented first. This is a map of the isthmus. We’ve got Lake Erie to the south, Lake Ontario to the north, Buffalo and western New York to the East, and Ontario, Canada, to the west. The Niagara River runs northward, connecting the two great lakes. And right in the middle, it plunges off the Niagara Escarpment, creating the famous falls. On the US side, there are the American Falls and the smaller Bridal Veil Falls. And on the Canadian side is the Horseshoe Falls where a majority of the river flows. It’s pretty impressive to see in person, but it’s actually not entirely a benefit. Because these falls pose a major problem for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Great Lakes form the largest inland freshwater transportation system in the world. Since the 19th century, they’ve served as the backbone for moving iron ore, coal, grain, and manufactured goods between the American heartland and the Atlantic Ocean. Ore from Minnesota and grain from the Midwest can travel by ship all the way to steel mills or export terminals on the East Coast. Barges and freighters are efficient at moving bulk cargo in a way rail and trucks can’t match. For a time, the Niagara Escarpment was a natural bottleneck between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, preventing goods from moving directly between the upper lakes and the Atlantic. Freight had to be offloaded and portaged around the falls before it could continue its journey. The Erie Canal solved the problem somewhat, starting in 1825, bypassing Lake Ontario. But it could only accommodate smaller vessels, and even before the Canal opened, another solution was being planned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Welland Canal runs through the peninsula west of the Niagara River, connecting two massive areas by shipping traffic for the first time in 1829. The canal fueled the early growth of cities along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River - including Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City - and it’s been rebuilt and moved several times over its life. The Welland Canal is really a titanic engineering achievement and, were it not positioned next to one of the natural wonders of the world, it would probably be famous in its own right. Because of the huge difference in elevation between the two lakes created by the escarpment, eight separate locks are required to allow ships to traverse between them. And all different kinds do - from personal leisure craft to the lakers that stay in fresh water to the salties that travel between the lakes and the ocean through the St. Lawrence Seaway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting on the upstream, Lake Erie side of the canal, the first lock isn’t really for lifting or lowering ships so much as for control. The level of Lake Erie actually fluctuates throughout the year, and there are longer-term trends as well. Wind storms also raise the level locally similar to the way storm surge works during hurricanes. The control lock does just that: it controls the level in the downstream canal. It prevents excess water from rushing down the canal when the lake is high, kind of like an airlock on a spaceship keeps air from rushing out when astronauts step outside for a spacewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downstream of the control lock, the canal splits in two. The original pathway of the canal flows through the eponymous town of Welland, while the larger and newer section of canal, the Welland Bypass… well, it bypasses Welland to the east. If you look carefully, you’ll also notice a small river, the Welland River, which passes underneath both the original and bypass canals. On the way downstream from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, shipping traffic passes over aqueducts that pass over a natural river. A hydrological wonderland!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing downstream from the aqueducts, the remaining seven locks are lift locks, more like what you think of when you imagine a lock. Notice how they’re clustered tightly around the terrain and not distributed evenly along the length of the canal. That’s the Niagara escarpment, the same geological feature that the water cascades down at the falls. This is the elevation diagram of the entire Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway system from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean, and you can see that this drop is the biggest one of the whole thing. And that’s pretty important for another part of the infrastructure on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power available from a moving fluid is directly proportional to the flow rate multiplied by the height of the drop. In most hydropower applications, that height is created artificially by a dam. There aren’t that many places in the world where you have both a large volume of flowing water and a significant natural drop in elevation. But that combination made Niagara Falls the birthplace of large-scale electric power in North America. In 1895, the Niagara Power Company opened the Edward Dean Adams Power Plant, built with Westinghouse AC generators based on the ideas and patents of Nikola Tesla. The plant served as the basis for the modern electrical grids we have today, and many of the fundamental concepts are basically unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the power infrastructure at Niagara Falls definitely has changed. Where the Adams Power Plant put out about 40 megawatts of power in 1895, now the combined capacity from the region is in the neighborhood of 5 gigawatts. But in both cases, it wasn’t as simple as putting a turbine at the base of the falls. While it might be technically possible to generate power by placing a water wheel directly in the stream of a waterfall like a kid’s bath toy, it’s not the most efficient way (plus it would take away from the beauty). The water used to power the hydroelectric plants on both the US and Canadian sides of the Niagara River is water that never actually flows over the falls. Instead, it’s diverted into five massive tunnels - two on the US side and three on the Canadian side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like most tunnels, you can’t really see the extent of the hydro tunnels at Niagara Falls. There are a few conspicuous clues though, like these gigantic buildings. These interesting protrusions from the landscape house enormous steel doors, nearly 60 feet tall, that can drop down into the tunnels and close off the flow for inspections and maintenance. Both the Ontario and New York sides of the river feature similar structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the tunnels, water flows into major hydropower plants on both sides of the border: the twin Adam Beck stations on the Canadian side and Robert Moses station on the US side. Then it’s released into the the lower part of the river below the falls. When you add them up, that’s 39 turbines with a combined capacity of more than 4000 megawatts. It’s a tremendous amount of power generation in one place. But actually, that’s not all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tunnels divert 50-75% of the flow of the Niagara River. That wide range in percentage of diversion isn’t because we don’t know how much is diverted, but because we actually control how much water is diverted, depending on the tourist requirements agreed upon in a treaty by both nations. During the day in peak tourist season, more water is allowed to flow over the falls to ensure the grandeur of the falls is on full display for the huge crowds of tourists that visit every year. At night and during the winter, more of the flow is diverted to generate power. That’s all managed by this structure upstream of the falls: the international control dam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought this is an interesting dam, since it doesn’t even go all the way across the river. But it doesn’t need to. This structure’s not meant to create a reservoir; it just subtly adjusts the level in the river to control how much water flows over the falls versus into the hydropower intakes. The US side of the Niagara River is pretty shallow, so that side acts kind of like an uncontrolled spillway. Then, the gates on the Canadian side can be adjusted to balance the competing demands on water between tourism and power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s one big problem with those competing needs: they both have the same timing. We want thunderous cascades of water over the falls during the day when tourists are visiting, but daytime is also when the demand for electricity is highest. It’s like if solar panels only worked at night. To accommodate this, both the US and Canada have pumped storage plants. At night, excess electricity is used to pump diverted water into reservoirs, essentially storing both the power and the extra water that’s available during off-peak hours. Then, during the day, the water is released back into the forebay of the power plants. You get a little extra power from that drop out of the reservoir into the forebays, so both sides have small hydropower facilities to capture that. But more importantly, you get a lot more water during the day than would otherwise be available to run through the big plants, making more power when it’s needed most. And there’s just something funny to me that the infrastructure is duplicated on both sides of the river, like neither country was willing to be one-upped by the other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this diversion noticeably reduces the flow of water over the falls. Even when they are at ‘full blast’ during the day in the tourist season, only 50% of the flow of the Niagara River makes it over the falls. You can imagine how powerful the falls would be if 100% of the flow were to cascade over. It might seem like this diversion detracts from the majesty of the falls, but in another sense, it actually preserves it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All waterfalls undergo some degree of erosion as the water and sediment suspended in it scours away the rocks and soil underneath. Without any diversion, Niagara Falls would be receding towards Lake Erie at a rate of about 3 feet every year. At the end of the last ice age, the falls were right at the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, but thousands of years of erosion have caused them to work their way upstream. You can actually see how far it’s already progressed by looking at this elevation map. Over the last 12,000 years or so, the falls have migrated by erosion to their current location. By diverting a significant portion of the flow, the power plants have actually slowed the rate of erosion to approximately one foot per year, which will help preserve the falls for a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While flow on the falls is downregulated by diversion for hydropower, the falls are never ‘turned off’...except for the one time in the 1960s. The smaller American Falls (and nearby Bridal Veil Falls) have a pile of loose rocks and boulders, called talus, at their base. This pile of rocky debris actually extends a good fraction of the way up the falls, and officials worried that the falls might ultimately transition into a series of rapids cascading down the slope of talus rather than remaining a majestic waterfall. So, in 1969, the Army Corps of Engineers built a temporary cofferdam between the New York shoreline and Goat Island, diverting the water over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls and leaving the American Falls dry(ish)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the engineers got a chance to inspect the situation, they determined that the best course of action was just to leave the majority of the talus in place, since it seemed to be stabilizing the cliff face. Sometimes, doing mostly nothing is a decision you make as an engineer, even if you have to do a monumental amount of work to come to that conclusion. So the cofferdam was taken out, and water has flowed continuously over all the falls since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really highlights the complexity of Niagara Falls. On the one hand, you have one of the natural wonders of the world, an absolutely enormous set of waterfalls that inspire awe and wonder in the countless travelers who are lucky enough to take in the view. The same thing that makes it impressive for tourists (the big drop) makes it valuable for power and a major challenge for shipping. And out of that comes all kinds of fascinating infrastructure, not only to facilitate the tourism but the other stuff too: a major canal with locks and aqueducts, the international dam control gates, pumped storage reservoirs, epic tunnels, towering gates, massive hydropower plants, and so much more. It’s really a pretty remarkable place for engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Strix Halo is the codename for AMD’s highest end mobile chip, which is used in the Ryzen AI MAX series. It combines a powerful CPU with 16 Zen 5 cores and a large GPU with 20 RDNA 3.5 Workgroup Processors (WGPs). The sizeable iGPU makes Strix Halo particularly interesting because GPUs have high bandwidth requirements. Strix Halo tackles that with a 256-bit LPDDR5X-8000 setup combined with 32 MB of memory side cache. The latter is often referred to as Infinity Cache, or MALL (Memory Attached Last Level). I’ll refer to it as Infinity Cache for brevity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infinity Cache has been around since RDNA2 in AMD’s discrete consumer GPU lineup, where it helped AMD hit high performance targets with lower DRAM bandwidth requirements. However, Infinity Cache’s efficacy has so far been difficult for me to evaluate. AMD’s discrete GPUs have performance monitoring facilities accessible through AMD’s developer tools. But those tools stop providing information past L2. Strix Halo stands out because it has an Infinity Cache implementation, and all the accessible performance monitoring features typical of a recent AMD GPU. That includes programmable performance counters at Infinity Fabric and memory controllers. It’s an opportunity to finally get insight into how well AMD’s Infinity Cache does its job in various graphics workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Special thanks goes out to ASUS for sampling their ROG Flow Z13. This device implements AMD’s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 with 32 GB of LPDDR5X in a thin and light form factor. It superficially represents a convertible tablet from Microsoft’s Surface line, and is remarkably portable for a device with gaming credentials. Without ASUS’s help, this article wouldn’t have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Infinity Fabric, Performance Monitoring, and Theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD’s Infinity Fabric aims to abstract away details of how data travels across the chip. It does so by providing endpoints with well defined interfaces to let blocks make or handle memory requests. Infinity Fabric also provides a set of programmable performance counters. AMD documents a single DATA_BW performance event that counts data beats at endpoints. DATA_BW targets an endpoint via its 8-bit instance ID, and can count either reads or writes. AMD never documented Infinity Fabric instance IDs for Strix Halo. So, I did some guessing by generating traffic at various blocks and observing bandwidth counts at all possible instance IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instance IDs start from the Coherent Stations (CS-es), just like on server platforms. CS blocks sit in front of memory controllers and ensure cache coherency by probing another block if it might have a modified copy of the requested cacheline. If it doesn’t, which is most of the time, the CS will pass the request on to its attached Unified Memory Controller (UMC). Because CS blocks observe all requests to physical memory backed by DRAM, it’s a logical place to implement a memory side cache. That’s exactly what AMD does on chips with Infinity Cache. Cache hits let the CS avoid going to the UMC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strix Halo has 16 memory controllers and CS instances, each handling a 16-bit LPDDR5X channel. The GPU occupies the next eight instance IDs, suggesting it has a wide interface to Infinity Fabric. CPU core clusters come next. Each octa-core Zen 5 Core Complex (CCX) connects to Infinity Fabric via one endpoint. Miscellaneous blocks follow. These include the NPU, media engine, the display engine, and a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up Performance Monitoring&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cache misses usually cause a request to the next level in the memory hierarchy, while cache hits do not. Therefore, my idea is to compare traffic levels at the CS and UMC levels. Traffic that shows up at the CS but not at the UMCs can be used as a proxy for Infinity Cache hits. There are a few problems with that approach though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Strix Halo only provides eight Infinity Fabric performance counters. I have to use two counters per endpoint to count both read and write data beats, so I can only monitor four CS-es simultaneously. Memory traffic is interleaved across channels, so taking bandwidth observed at four CS-es and multiplying by four should give a reasonably accurate estimate of overall bandwidth. But interleaving isn’t perfectly even in practice, so I expect a few percentage points of error. The UMC situation is easier. Each UMC has its own set of four performance counters, letting me monitor all of them at the same time. I’m using one counter per UMC to count Column Address Strobe (CAS) commands. Other available UMC events allow monitoring memory controller frequency, bus utilization, and ACTIVATE or PRECHARGE commands. But that stuff goes beyond what I want to focus on here, and collecting more data points would make for annoyingly large spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-CCX traffic presents a second source of error as mentioned above. If a CS sends a probe that hits a modified line, it won’t send a request to the UMC. The request is still being satisfied out of cache, just not the Infinity Cache that I’m interested in. I expect this to be rare because cross-CCX traffic in general is usually low compared to requests satisfied from DRAM. It’ll be especially rare in the graphics workloads I’m targeting here because Strix Halo’s second CCD tends to be parked in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU-side traffic in general presents a more significant issue. Strix Halo’s Infinity Cache narrowly targets the GPU, and only GPU-side memory requests cause cache fills. CPU memory accesses will be counted as misses in a hitrate calculation. That may be technically correct, but misses the point of Infinity Cache. Most memory traffic comes from the GPU, but there’s enough CPU-side traffic to create a bit more of an error bar than I’d like. Therefore, I want to focus on whether Infinity Cache is handling enough traffic to avoid hitting DRAM bandwidth bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A final limitation is that I’m sampling performance counters with a tool I wrote years ago. I wrote it so I could look at hardware performance stats just like how I like looking at Task Manager or other monitoring utilities to see how my system is doing. Because I’m updating a graphical interface, I sample data every second and thus have lower resolution compared to some vendor tools. Those can often sample at millisecond granularity or better. That opens the window to underestimating bandwidth demands if a bandwidth spike only occurs over a small fraction of a second. In theory I could write another tool. But Chips and Cheese is an unpaid hobby project that has to be balanced with a separate full time job as well as other free time interests. Quickly rigging an existing project to do my bidding makes more efficient use of time, because there’s never enough time to do everything I want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I logged data over some arbitrarily selected graphics workloads, then selected the 1-second interval with the highest DRAM bandwidth usage. That should give an idea of whether Strix Halo comes close to reaching DRAM bandwidth limits. Overall, the 32 MB cache seems to do its job. Strix Halo is able to stay well clear of the 256 GB/s theoretical bandwidth limit that its LPDDR5X-8000 setup can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximate CS-side bandwidth demands do indicate several workloads can push uncomfortably close to 256 GB/s. A workload doesn’t necessarily have to get right up to bandwidth limits for memory-related performance issues to start cropping up. Under high bandwidth demand, requests can start to pile up in various queues and end-to-end memory latency can increase. GHPC and Ungine Valley fall into that category. 3DMark Time Spy Extreme would definitely be DRAM bandwidth bound without the memory side cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking an interval with maximum bandwidth demands at the CS gives an idea of how much bandwidth Strix Halo’s GPU can demand. Strix Halo has the same 2 MB of graphics L2 cache that AMD’s older 7000 series “Phoenix” mobile chip had, despite more than doubling GPU compute throughput. Unsurprisingly, the GPU can draw a lot of bandwidth across Infinity Fabric. 3DMark Time Spy again stands out. If AMD wanted to simply scale up DRAM bandwidth without spending die area on cache, they would need well over 335 GB/s from DRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curiously, Digital Foundry notes that Strix Halo has very similar graphics performance to the PS5. The PS5 uses a 256-bit, 14 GT/s GDDR6 setup that’s good for 448 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth, and doesn’t have a memory side cache like Strix Halo. 448 GB/s looks just about adequate for satisfying Time Spy Extreme’s bandwidth needs, if just barely. If Strix Halo didn’t need to work in power constrained mobile devices, and didn’t need high memory capacity for multitasking, perhaps AMD could have considered a GDDR6 setup. To bring things back around to Infinity Cache, it seems to do very well at that interval above. It captures approximately 73% of memory traffic going through Infinity Fabric, which is good even from a hitrate point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two bar graphs above already hint at how bandwidth demands and cache hitrates vary across workloads. Those figures vary within a workload as well, though plotting all of the logged data would be excessive. Variation both across and within workloads makes it extremely difficult to summarize cache efficacy with a single hitrate figure. Plotting the percentage of traffic at the CS not observed at the UMCs as a proxy for hitrate further emphasizes that point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resolution settings can impact cache hitrate as well. While I don’t have a direct look at hitrate figures, plotting with the data I do have suggests increasing resolution in the Ungine Valley benchmark tends to depress hitrate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD presented a slide at Hot Chips 2021 with three lines for different resolutions across a set of different cache capacities. I obviously can’t test different cache capacities. But AMD’s slide does beg the question of how well a 32 MB cache can do at a wider range of resolutions, and whether bandwidth demands remain under control at resolutions higher than what AMD may have optimized the platform for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ungine Superposition and 3DMark workloads can both target a variety of resolutions without regard to monitor resolution. Logging data throughout benchmark runs at different resolutions shows the 32 MB cache providing reasonable “bandwidth amplification” at reasonable resolutions. At unreasonable resolutions, the cache is still able to do something. But it’s not as effective as it was at lower resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plotting data over time shows spikes and dips in Infinity Cache efficacy occur at remarkably consistent times, even at different resolutions. 8K is an exception with the Superposition benchmark. The 8K line looks stretched out, possibly because Strix Halo’s GPU was only able to average a bit over 10 FPS, and time got slowed a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Strix Halo’s iGPU were capable of delivering over 30 FPS in Superposition, AMD would definitely need a larger cache, more DRAM bandwidth, or a combination of both. Taking a simplistic view and tripling maximum observed 8K bandwidth demands would give a figure just north of 525 GB/s. But Strix Halo’s iGPU clearly wasn’t built with such a scenario in mind, and AMD’s selected combination of cache capacity and DRAM bandwidth works well enough at all tested resolutions. While high resolutions create the most DRAM traffic, 1080P shows the heaviest bandwidth demands at the Infinity Fabric level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3DMark Wild Life Extreme is a better example because it’s a lightweight benchmark designed to run on mobile devices. Strix Halo’s iGPU can average above 30 FPS even when rendering at 8K. Again, DRAM bandwidth demands increase and Infinity Cache becomes less effective as resolution goes up. But Infinity Cache still does enough to keep the chip well clear of DRAM bandwidth limits. Thus the cache does its job, and the bandwidth situation remains under control across a wide range of resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bandwidth demands are more important than hitrates. Curiously though, Wild Life Extreme experiences increasingly severe hitrate dips at higher resolutions around the 16-19 and 45-52 second intervals. Those dips barely show at 1440P or below. Perhaps a 32 MB cache’s efficacy also shows more variation as resolution increases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Video?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few errors here - I said Core Coherent Master read/write beats were 32B and 64B/cycle. It’s not per cycle, it’s per data beat. And I meant to say reads outnumber writes at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chip designers have to tune their designs to perform well across a wide variety of workloads. Cache sizes are one parameter on the list. AMD chose to combine a 32 MB cache with 256 GB/s of DRAM bandwidth, and it seems to do well enough across the workloads I tested. Monitoring at the CS-es and UMCs also supports AMD’s data showing that higher resolutions tend to depress hitrate. Those results explain why larger GPUs tend to have larger caches and higher DRAM bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a higher level, GPU bandwidth demands have been a persistent challenge for large iGPUs and have driven a diverse set of solutions. Over a decade ago, Intel created “halo” iGPU variants and paired a 128 MB eDRAM cache while sticking with a typical 128-bit client memory bus. AMD’s console chips use large and fast DRAM buses. The PS5 is one example. Strix Halo does a bit of both. It combines modest cache capacity with a more DRAM bandwidth than typical client chips, but doesn’t rely as much on DRAM bandwidth as console chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those varied approaches to the bandwidth problem are fascinating. Watching how Infinity Cache behaves in various graphics workloads has been fascinating as well. But everything would be so much more fun if AMD’s tools provided direct data on Infinity Cache hitrates. That applies to both integrated and discrete GPUs. Infinity Cache is a well established part of AMD’s strategy. It has been around for several generations, and now has a presence in AMD’s mobile lineup too. I suspect developers would love to see Infinity Cache hitrates in addition to the data on GPU-private caches that AMD’s current tools show.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;French ex-president Sarkozy begins jail sentence for campaign finance conspiracy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first French ex-president to go to jail, as he starts a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain was jailed for treason in 1945 has any French ex-leader gone behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy, who was president from 2007-2012, has appealed against his jail term at La Santé prison, where he will occupy a small cell in the its isolation wing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 100 people applauded and shouted "Nicolas!" as he left his villa in the exclusive 16th district of Paris, holding his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy by the hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His son Louis, 28, had appealed to supporters for a show of support, while another son, Pierre, called for a message of love – "nothing else, please".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy, 70, was driven through the entrance of the notoriously overcrowded 19th-Century prison in the Montparnasse district south of the River Seine at 09:40 local time (07:40 GMT), while dozens of police officers cordoned off most of the surrounding streets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He continues to protest his innocence in the highly controversial Libyan money affair and posted a message on X as he was driven to the jail, saying: "I have no doubt. Truth will prevail. But how crushing the price will have been."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"With unwavering strength I tell [the French people] it is not a former president they are locking up this morning - it is an innocent man," he wrote. "Do not feel sorry for me because my wife and my children are by my side... but this morning I feel deep sorrow for a France humiliated by a will for revenge."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moments after Sarkozy entered jail, his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request for his release had been filed. Nothing justified his imprisonment, said Mr Ingrain, adding: "He'll be inside for at least three weeks or a month."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy has said he wants no special treatment at La Santé prison, although he has been put in its isolation section for his own safety as other inmates are infamous drugs dealers or have been convicted for terror offences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Small cell with TV, and one hour's daily exercise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy's cell in the prison's isolation wing is believed to be on the top floor and will measure between 9-11 sq m (95-120 sq ft). There had earlier been talk of him serving his term in another wing for "vulnerable people", where other VIPs have been jailed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He will have a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV, for which he will have to pay a monthly €14 (£12) fee, and the right to a small fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former president has the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits as well as written and phone contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he is in effect in solitary confinement, allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Conditions of detention in an isolation wing are pretty hard," La Santé ex-deputy head Flavie Rault told BFMTV. "You are alone, all the time. The only contact you have is with prison staff. You never come across another detainee for security reasons and there's a type of social isolation which makes life difficult".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of last week, Sarkozy was received at the Élysée Palace by President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Monday "it was normal that on a human level I should receive one of my predecessors in that context".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Macron stressed on Tuesday that it was not his role "to comment on or criticise judicial decisions", but he said it was normal that for many in France the sight of "a president jailed by this judicial decision would provoke comment".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a further measure of official support for the ex-president, Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin said he would go to visit him in prison as part of his role in ensuring Sarkozy's safety and the proper functioning of the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I cannot be insensitive to a man's distress," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever since he left office in 2012, Sarkozy has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Late next month, France's highest administrative court will give its verdict on Sarkozy's appeal against a six-month jail term in another illegal campaign financing case known as the Bygmalion affair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahead of his arrival at La Santé prison, Sarkozy gave a series of media interviews, telling La Tribune: "I'm not afraid of prison. I'll keep my head held high, including at the prison gates."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy has always denied doing anything wrong in a case involving allegations that his 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of euros in Libyan cash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former centre-right leader was cleared of personally receiving the money but convicted of criminal association with two close aides, Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guéant, for their role in secret campaign financing from the Libyans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two men both had talks with Gaddafi's intelligence chief and brother-in-law in 2005, a meeting arranged by a Franco-Lebanese intermediary called Ziad Tiakeddine, who died in Lebanon shortly before Sarkozy's conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As he lodged an appeal, Sarkozy is still considered innocent but he has been told he must go to jail in view of the "exceptional seriousness of the facts".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarkozy said he would take two books with him into prison, a life of Jesus by Jean-Christian Petitfils and the Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas's classic story of a man wrongly imprisoned who escapes to wreak vengeance on his prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Knocker is a configurable, and self-hosted service that provides an HTTP based "knock-knock" single-packet authorization (SPA) gateway for your Homelab with web, cli and android clients. it can be used as authentication for your reverse proxy like Caddy, or even on the firewall level using the FirewallD integration. It allows you to keep your services completely private, opening them up on-demand only for authorized IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is ideal for homelab environments where you want to expose services to the internet without a persistent VPN connection, while minimizing your public-facing attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker works by acting as an auth gateway for your reverse Proxy. It offers a verify endpoint, to check if the requesting IP is whitelisted or not, if not it will reply with a 401 and the reverse proxy will refuse the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caddy has the &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; directive to check connections using an auth endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define a Reusable Snippet: It's best practice to define a snippet in your&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Caddyfile&lt;/code&gt;for the auth check.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Protect Your Services: Import the snippet for any service you want to protect.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example &lt;code&gt;Caddyfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Caddyfile

# Define a reusable snippet for the knock-knock check.
# It points to the knocker service using Docker's internal DNS.
(knocker_auth) {
  forward_auth knocker:8000 {
    uri /verify
    copy_headers X-Forwarded-For
  }
}

# The public endpoint for performing the knock.
# Make sure this domain points to your Caddy server's IP.
knock.your-domain.com {
  reverse_proxy knocker:8000
}

# An example protected service.
jellyfin.your-domain.com {
  import knocker_auth  # Apply the forward_auth check
  reverse_proxy jellyfin_service_name:8096
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a user is not whitelisted, Caddy's &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; directive will return a &lt;code&gt;401 Unauthorized&lt;/code&gt; response with an empty body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important Note: Caddy's &lt;code&gt;handle_errors&lt;/code&gt; directive does not work with &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; responses. The error response comes directly from the authentication service (knocker), not from Caddy itself, so &lt;code&gt;handle_errors&lt;/code&gt; cannot intercept or modify these responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker provides advanced firewall integration through firewalld, creating dynamic, time-based firewall rules that automatically expire based on the TTL specified in knock requests. This feature operates at the network level, allowing you to use knocker for non-http services like ssh or game servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as User
    participant Firewall as Firewalld (knocker zone)
    participant Knocker
    participant Service as Protected Service (port 22)

    Note over Client,Firewall: Initial state — monitored port is blocked by default
    Client-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Firewall: TCP SYN to Service:22
    Firewall--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Client: DROP (no response)

    Note over Client,Knocker: User performs a knock to whitelist their IP
    Client-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: POST /knock (X-Api-Key, optional ip_address, ttl)
    Knocker-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: validate API key &amp;amp; determine client IP
    Knocker-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Firewall: add rich accept rule for client IP on port 22 with timeout
    Firewall--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: success

    Note over Firewall,Client: New rule overrides DROP due to higher priority
    Client-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Firewall: TCP SYN to Service:22
    Firewall-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Service: forward packet
    Service--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Client: TCP SYN-ACK (connection established)
    Knocker-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Knocker: update whitelist.json with expiry
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker requires FirewallD 2.0+ due to dependency on the zone priority feature. It's available in Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and other recent stable distros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FirewallD was chosen for the ability to separates the cli interface from the daemon. This allows Knocker to control firewalld from within a Docker container by mounting the system's D-Bus socket, and FirewallD also has support for timed rules, so knocker rules automatically expire by the end of the TTL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FIREWALLD WILL NOT WORK WITH DOCKER PUBLISHED PORTS, check this issue for more details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creates a dedicated firewalld zone with high priority&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adds DROP/REJECT rules for monitored ports to block unauthorized access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamically adds ALLOW rules for whitelisted IPs that override the blocking rules&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically expires rules based on TTL using firewalld's timeout mechanism&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recovers rules on startup by comparing whitelist.json with active firewalld rules&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prerequisites:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;FirewallD 2.0+ installed and running on the host system&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Docker container must run as root for D-Bus access&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Configuration&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;enable FirewallD in the knocker.yaml config, settings are already available in the example config&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mount the Dbus socket into the docker container, and make sure it runs as root, the required entires are commented out in the docker-compose.yml file.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monitor active rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Check knocker zone
firewall-cmd --zone=knocker --list-all

# View rich rules
firewall-cmd --zone=knocker --list-rich-rules

# Monitor rule changes
journalctl -u firewalld -f&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For detailed configuration, architecture, and troubleshooting information, see the complete FirewallD Integration Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are enabling knocking for IPs behind tailscale or other IPs, you may face issues due to how userland-proxy works, you may get different request IP from the actual ip address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disabling Userland-proxy should fix it, but make sure to test your setup. You could also use host networking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This endpoint validates an API key and whitelists an IP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;To whitelist a remote IP/CIDR (requires &lt;code&gt;allow_remote_whitelist: true&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;{"ip_address": "YOUR_TARGET_IP_OR_CIDR"}&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To whitelist a remote IP/CIDR (requires &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Example (Whitelisting your own IP):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;curl -i -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY" https://knock.your-domain.com/knock&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success Response (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;quote&gt;{ "whitelisted_entry": "1.2.3.4", "expires_at": 1672534800, "expires_in_seconds": 3600 }&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This endpoint is used by Caddy's &lt;code&gt;forward_auth&lt;/code&gt; to check if the client's IP is whitelisted. It returns &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt; on success and &lt;code&gt;401 Unauthorized&lt;/code&gt; on failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project includes a full test suite&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run the tests locally:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install Dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;pip install -r src/requirements.txt&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Run Pytest:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;python3 -m pytest&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a dev environment under dev, with bash scripts for integrations tests with caddy and a separate one with firewalld. The CI runs the caddy tests, but firewalld needs a privileged runner, which is why it needs to be run locally and isn't a part of the CI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interactive documentation endpoints (&lt;code&gt;/docs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/redoc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/openapi.json&lt;/code&gt;) are disabled by default. To expose them, set the following in &lt;code&gt;knocker.yaml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;documentation:
  enabled: true
  openapi_output_path: "openapi.json"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When documentation is disabled (default), Knocker removes these endpoints and deletes any previously generated schema file to prevent stale artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a formal API specification and a summary of the architectural choices, please see the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knocker was fully vibe coded. The initial implementation was done with Gemini 2.5 pro, thanks to the tokens provided in the roo code/requesty hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further features were mostly done with the GitHub copilot Agent (sonnet 4/later 4.5), which needed a lot of fixes, done mostly by GPT-5 mini/CODEX.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In Memoriam/gbnewby&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm very sad to announce that Dr. Gregory B. Newby (gbnewby) has died after a short battle with cancer. Dr. Newby was CEO of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation for more than 20 years and, in that role, worked very closely with Distributed Proofreaders. He was also a voting member of the Distributed Proofreader Foundation board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Born in Canada, Dr. Newby grew up in the US. He returned to Canada, however, to work for the government in the Yukon Territory as he continued his direction of Project Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent interview, Greg described how he, a life-long reader, became excited about the possibilities of ebooks back in 1987 when someone emailed him a copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -- "I immediately realized what a tremendous thing that was." He cared deeply about Project Gutenberg's mission. "You know," he told the podcast interviewer, "That keeps me going ... having a positive impact and getting all that literature into people's hands."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Dr. Newby collaborated with Microsoft and MIT to produce the Project Gutenberg Open Audiobook Collection of AI-narrated audiobooks. This initiative was named one of "The Best Inventions of 2023" by TIME magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greg's vision saw the ebooks (many of them produced here at Distributed Proofreaders) made available through Project Gutenberg grow to more than 75,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Newby and his tireless leadership of Project Gutenberg was a close partner of Distributed Proofreaders and will be greatly missed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official announcement is here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Extraterrestrial data centers are just on the horizon. Soon, an AI-equipped satellite from Starcloud, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, will orbit the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a large step toward the startup’s ultimate goal to bring state-of-the-art data centers to outer space. This can be a part of the solution to address challenges faced by rising AI demands, including energy consumption and cooling requirements for data centers on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In space, you get almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy,” said Philip Johnston, cofounder and CEO of the startup, which is based in Redmond, Washington. “The only cost on the environment will be on the launch, then there will be 10x carbon-dioxide savings over the life of the data center compared with powering the data center terrestrially on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starcloud’s upcoming satellite launch, planned for November, will mark the NVIDIA H100 GPU’s cosmic debut — and the first time a state-of-the-art, data center-class GPU is in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 60-kilogram Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small fridge, is expected to offer 100x more powerful GPU compute than any previous space-based operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on fresh water for cooling through evaporation towers, as many Earth-based data centers do, Starcloud’s space-based data centers can use the vacuum of deep space as an infinite heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emitting waste heat from infrared radiation into space can conserve significant water resources on Earth, since water isn’t needed for cooling. Constant exposure to the sun in orbit also means nearly infinite solar power — aka no need for the data centers to rely on batteries or backup power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starcloud projects the energy costs in space to be 10x cheaper than land-based options, even including launch expenses. “In 10 years, nearly all new data centers will be being built in outer space,” Johnston predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An early use case for extraterrestrial data centers is the analysis of Earth observation data, which could inform applications for detecting crop types and predicting local weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus, real-time data processing in space offers immense benefits for critical applications such as wildfire detection and distress-signal response. Running inference in space, right where the data’s collected, allows insights to be delivered nearly instantaneously, reducing response times from hours to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earth observation methods include optical imaging with cameras, hyperspectral imaging using light wavelengths beyond human vision and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging to build high-resolution, 3D maps of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SAR, in particular, generates lots of data — about 10 gigabytes per second, according to Johnston — so in-space inference would be especially beneficial when creating these maps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Starcloud needs to be competitive with the type of workload you can run on an Earth-based data center, and NVIDIA GPUs are the most performant in terms of training, fine-tuning and inference,” Johnston said, explaining why the company chose to use NVIDIA accelerated computing on its upcoming satellite launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Being a part of NVIDIA Inception has been critical, as it provided us with technical support, access to NVIDIA experts and NVIDIA GPUs,” Johnston added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starcloud is a recent graduate of the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator plans to run Gemma — an open model from Google — in orbit on H100 GPUs, proving even large language models can run in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for future launches, the startup is looking to integrate the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, which Johnston expects will offer even greater in-orbit AI performance, with improvements of up to 10x compared with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Shift FinOps Left: Proactively Find &amp;amp; Fix Cloud Cost Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overview&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spend on public cloud is fast approaching $1 trillion per year - we estimate this boundary will be crossed before the turn of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g. Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK) and platform engineering have fundamentally changed who makes spending decisions. In the past, only a central team provisioned cloud resources. Now every engineer can provision resources as needed; every engineer has become a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infracost helps engineers see the cost of their code changes before any money has been spent - we sit in the engineering workflow, show the cost impact, and suggest optimizations. That’s what we mean by “Shift FinOps Left”, and we’ve seen strong pull from engineers who use Infracost in their terminals, CI/CD pipelines and IDEs. The Infracost CLI repo has 12K stars on GitHub! There’s a massive opportunity to help organizations proactively manage their cloud spend; rather than reacting to surprise cost spikes after the fact. We know reactive is too late; we saw that firsthand with our first startup a decade ago, and we’re building Infracost to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring our first Developer Advocate to help more engineers discover and fall in love with Infracost. Your mission is simple: increase signups by showing DevOps, SRE, Platform, and Infrastructure engineers the value of Infracost in the channels and workflows they already use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll work closely with our Developer Adoption product engineering team, which is focused on DX: CLI, VS Code &amp;amp; JetBrains extensions, MCP server, Copilot integrations…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Timezone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US or EU timezones (our engineering team is based between GMT -6 and GMT+2). We are fully remote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we value&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll get to meet all 3 co-founders, so bring your questions 😃&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since launching Infracost in 2021, we’ve been pulled by engineers who all want to Shift FinOps Left. We enable them to proactively find and fix cloud cost issues before they hit production. We plug directly into developer workflows (like GitHub and Azure Repos), show cost impact in pull requests, enforce tagging and FinOps best practices, and even generate PRs to fix issues automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're backed by Sequoia, YC and trusted by Fortune 500 enterprises. You'll join a small, experienced, and supportive team that's shipping fast, solving real infrastructure problems, and having fun while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you're an engineer tackling complex systems (e.g. parsing massive Terraform repos, scaling real-time systems), a product manager shaping strategy from real customer pain points, or a customer success lead working directly with users; there’s meaningful work here for you. If you care about cloud efficiency, great UX, and helping teams move faster and smarter, we’d love to work with you!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click. Ugh. Another one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know the drill. You land on a new website, eager to read an article or check a product price, and before the page even finishes loading, it appears: the dreaded cookie banner. A pop-up, a slide-in, a full-screen overlay demanding you "Accept All," "Manage Preferences," or navigate a labyrinth of toggles designed by a corporate lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people do the same thing: they sigh, their eyes glaze over, and they click "Accept All" with the muscle memory of a weary soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This daily ritual of digital whack-a-mole is the result of well-intentioned privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. The goal was noble: to give users control over their data. But the execution? It's a colossal failure. It has created a web experience that is more annoying, less transparent, and arguably no more private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem isn't the what. It's the where. The law placed the burden of consent on millions of individual websites, when it should have targeted the one tool we all use to access them: the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Insanity of the Status Quo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if every time you got into your car, you had to manually approve the engine's use of oil, the tires' use of air, and the radio's use of electricity. It’s absurd, right? You’d set your preferences once, and the car would just work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, that’s exactly what we do online. We are asked the same questions, by every single website, every single day. This approach is broken for three simple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consent Fatigue is Real: We're so bombarded with these requests that they’ve become meaningless. The banners are an obstacle to be cleared, not a choice to be considered. True consent requires a conscious, informed decision, not an exasperated click to get the pop-up out of the way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It Punishes the Little Guys: A giant corporation can afford a team of lawyers and expensive Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) to create a compliant (and often deliberately confusing) banner. But what about the small blogger, the local restaurant, or the indie developer? For them, it's another technical and legal headache, forcing them to install clunky, site-slowing plugins just to avoid a potential lawsuit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It Doesn't Actually Give Us Control: The illusion of choice is not choice. When the options are "Accept All" or "Spend Five Minutes in a Menu of Legalese," the system is designed to push you toward the path of least resistance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Simple, Radical Idea: Put Consent in the Browser&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine a different internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you set up your browser—be it Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge—you go through a simple, one-time setup. It asks for your privacy preferences in plain English:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you want to handle your data?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Essential Only: "Only allow data necessary for websites to function (e.g., keeping me logged in, remembering my shopping cart)."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Analytics: "Help creators improve their sites by letting them see anonymous data about how I use them."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Personalized Experience: "Allow sites to use my data for personalized content and relevant advertising."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Custom: Fine-tune your settings for specific data types.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You make your choice once. Set it and forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From that moment on, the responsibility shifts. Your browser becomes your personal privacy enforcer, and the law would require it to act on your behalf. Based on your one-time choice, it would be responsible for allowing or declining cookies from every site you visit. If a website tries to use a cookie with an unclear or undeclared purpose? The browser simply blocks it—no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's much more realistic and effective to make a handful of browsers follow the law than it is to force millions of websites to do the same thing. This isn't just a theory—it's the exact lesson we learned from the failure of the "Do Not Track" signal. DNT relied on websites to voluntarily honor a user's choice, and most simply didn't. Even if it were legally binding, you can't possibly police millions of websites to ensure they comply. By contrast, you can easily check that a few major browsers are actively enforcing the settings you choose. Browser-side enforcement solves the problem by turning a polite request into an unbreakable rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The World We Could Have&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This browser-centric model would fix everything that’s wrong with the current system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Users: Real Control &amp;amp; A Cleaner Web. Your choice would be meaningful because you’d make it once, thoughtfully. The result? A faster, cleaner, and radically less annoying internet experience. You could easily review or change your global settings at any time, right in your browser.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Website Owners: A Massive Burden Lifted. Suddenly, millions of developers, creators, and small business owners are freed from the role of digital janitor. They no longer need to install ugly, performance-killing scripts. Compliance becomes automatic. The web becomes more accessible and innovative.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Regulators: Easier Enforcement. Instead of trying to police millions of websites, regulators could focus on a handful of major browser developers. Are they implementing the standard correctly? Are they honoring the user's choice? It’s a much more efficient and effective system.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From a Tangled Mess to a Simple Tool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some might call this a radical change, but the truly radical thing is the convoluted system we've accepted as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, the internet runs on a fragile, sprawling patchwork of compliance tools. Think about the sheer absurdity of it. Every individual website owner is forced to bolt on a third-party Consent Management Platform (CMP). That platform must then be perfectly configured to talk to dozens of different ad-tech vendors, analytics scripts, and embedded services. All of this has to work flawlessly while navigating the subtle legal differences between GDPR, CCPA, and a growing list of other regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an ecosystem where countless platforms are all trying to talk to each other, duplicating effort and overcomplicating the simple act of a user saying "yes" or "no." We've built a million different, shaky bridges to solve a problem that requires only one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser-based approach cuts through this entire tangled web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It replaces millions of individual, often-conflicting systems with one, single source of truth: your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t about building a new, complex system. It’s about dismantling a monstrously inefficient one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s about freeing developers and small businesses from being amateur privacy lawyers. It’s about creating a standard that is clear for users, simple for creators, and effective for regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's time to take the consent dialog out of the websites we visit and put it where it always belonged: in our hands, via our browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tesla Inc. is recalling thousands of recently built vehicles over an issue that can cause a sudden loss of battery power, increasing the risk of a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem stems from a faulty battery pack connection part, which can lead to loss of propulsion without warning, Tesla said in documents posted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website. The company is recalling almost 8,000 Model Y SUVs and just over 5,000 Model 3 sedans produced from March through August of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.&lt;lb/&gt;We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.&lt;lb/&gt;BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.&lt;lb/&gt;BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.&lt;lb/&gt;BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.NE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;Obviously there have been many editorial changes at the formerly venerable Washington Post, a tawdry saga which I don’t intend to recap here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I do want to share is this, which I spotted yesterday during research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words – you get free access to news if you download PerplexityAI’s proprietary browser, which is built entirely around agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the idea of access to any form of content being conditional on the use of a proprietary browser, which is a particularly horrid 1990s throwback, I’m going to call this day 0 of an experiment in shifting the funding model of journalism from adtech to agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Journalism (or what’s left of it now) is in the state it’s in because of the adtech funding model. I don’t know what the solution is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1898, as the United Kingdom joined other powers in carving up the once mighty Qing empire, British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury warned a London audience that the world was dividing into “living” and “dying” nations. The living were the rising powers of the industrial age—states with growing populations, transformative technologies, and militaries of unprecedented range and firepower. The dying were stagnant empires, crippled by corruption, clinging to obsolete methods, and sliding toward ruin. Salisbury feared that the ascent of some, colliding with the decline of others, would hurl the world into catastrophic conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that era of power transitions is ending. For the first time in centuries, no country is rising fast enough to overturn the global balance. The demographic booms, industrial breakthroughs, and territorial acquisitions that once fueled great powers have largely run their course. China, the last major riser, is already peaking, its economy slowing and its population shrinking. Japan, Russia, and Europe stalled more than a decade ago. India has youth but lacks the human capital and state capacity to turn it into strength. The United States faces its own troubles—debt, sluggish growth, political dysfunction—but still outpaces rivals sinking into deeper decay. The rapid ascents that once defined modern geopolitics have yielded to sclerosis: the world is now a closed club of aging incumbents, circled by middle powers, developing countries, and failing states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reversal carries profound consequences. Over the long run, it may spare the world the ruinous cycle of rising powers—their quests for territory, resources, and status that so often ended in war. In the near term, however, stagnation and demographic shocks are spawning acute dangers. Fragile states are buckling under debt and youth bulges. Struggling powers are turning to militarization and irredentism to stave off decline. Economic insecurity is stoking extremism and corroding democracies, while the United States drifts toward thuggish unilateralism. The age of rising powers is ending, but its immediate aftermath may prove no less violent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;THE AGE OF ASCENT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the fad of likening China to a rising Athens and the United States to a threatened Sparta, true “rising powers” are a modern phenomenon. They emerged only in the last 250 years, with the Industrial Revolution, when coal, steam, and oil freed societies from the Malthusian trap, in which every bit of new wealth was swallowed by more mouths, keeping living standards stuck at subsistence. For the first time, wealth, population, and military might could expand in tandem—compounding rather than offsetting one another—allowing countries to amass power on a steady upward trajectory. This transformation rested on three forces: technologies that turbocharged productivity, burgeoning populations that swelled workforces and armies, and military machines enabling rapid conquest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The preindustrial world had none of these dynamics. From the year 1 to 1820, global income per person rose barely 0.017 percent annually, or just under two percent per century. With poverty the norm, shifts in power came only in fits and starts, usually by squeezing scarce resources. Chinese and Indian empires eked out agricultural surpluses, Venice and the Ottomans taxed trade, Spain and Portugal plundered silver, and the Habsburgs and Bourbons expanded through dynastic marriages. Military breakthroughs—cavalry under the Mongols or gunpowder under the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal empires—reshaped the balance for a time, but rivals eventually adapted. Even the United Kingdom’s vaunted fiscal-military state simply wrung more from scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Industrial Revolution broke scarcity’s grip and made productivity the foundation of power, vaulting societies from medieval to modern in under a century. A Briton born in 1830 entered a world of candles, horse carts, and wooden ships; by old age, that same person could ride a railroad, send a telegraph, and walk streets lined with electric lights, factory goods, and indoor plumbing. In one lifetime, per capita energy use multiplied five- to tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This upheaval produced the first modern rising powers. In the nineteenth century, per capita income growth expanded at 30 times its preindustrial pace, and the gains were concentrated among a handful of states, creating vast asymmetries in power. The United Kingdom, the United States, and the German states jumped from furnishing less than ten percent of global manufacturing in 1800 to more than half by 1900, while their per capita incomes roughly tripled. China’s and India’s shares, by contrast, fell from over half of world output to under ten percent, and the Habsburgs, Ottomans, and Russians remained largely agrarian, their industries swamped by imports. By 1900, populations in leading industrial nations earned about eight to ten times more per person than China or India, and several times more than those in Russia and the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. What had once been rough parity became the so-called Great Divergence between the West and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Productivity gains unleashed a population boom. Preindustrial societies had barely grown, with populations doubling only once in a thousand years. Industrialization shattered that ceiling: in the nineteenth century, the global population grew about ten times as fast as it had, on average, from year 1 to 1750. Mechanized farming, sanitation, electricity, refrigeration, and new medicines lifted global average life expectancy by more than 60 percent from 1770 to 1950, allowing populations to double every generation or two. Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States led this surge, followed by Japan and Russia, while China, India, and the Habsburg and Ottoman empires lagged behind. By World War I, armies that had once numbered in the tens of thousands could muster millions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Productivity is slowing, populations are shrinking, and conquest is growing harder.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manpower fueled industrial militaries—the third ingredient of rising power. Preindustrial warfare was brutal but limited. Armies were generally small, seasonal, and parasitic, living off the land and moving only as fast as hoof or sail allowed. With crude weapons and poor logistics, wars were frequent but indecisive, often dragging on for decades. Industrialization upended that world. Railroads, steamships, and telegraphs made mass mobilization possible, while rifles, machine guns, and heavy artillery multiplied killing power. By the early twentieth century, industrial empires controlled four-fifths of the globe, turning the map into a patchwork dominated by a handful of rising powers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these economic, demographic, and military revolutions pulled every region into a single arena. The value of global trade expanded tenfold from 1850 to 1913, and even long-insulated empires such as Tokugawa Japan and Qing China were forced into the fray. For the first time, nations confronted a stark choice: industrialize or be dominated. From that scramble emerged a small roster of great powers, each forged through a few exceptional routes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One was national consolidation, in which the first industrializing region of a fragmented land conquered the rest. Prussia hammered Germany together, Satsuma and Choshu built modern Japan, Piedmont spearheaded Italian unification, and the industrial North in the United States crushed native nations, defeated the secessionist, slave-holding South, and expanded westward. Another route to power was totalitarianism, as former empires pursued breakneck industrialization under ruthless dictators—Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler’s Germany, Mao Zedong’s China—at staggering human cost. A third route was to become a protectorate. China, having watched postwar Germany and Japan rebuild under U.S. protection, leaned toward Washington beginning in the 1970s to extract capital and know-how before breaking away in this century to pursue primacy. These were the doors into the rising power club—and all opened under the extraordinary technological, demographic, and military conditions of the industrial age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FROM TAILWINDS TO HEADWINDS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those doors are now closing. Productivity is slowing, populations are shrinking, and conquest is growing harder. Today’s technologies, remarkable though they are, have not remade life as the Industrial Revolution did. An American apartment from the 1940s, with a refrigerator, gas stove, electric lights, and telephone, would feel familiar today. By contrast, an 1870s home, with an outhouse, water well, and fireplace for cooking and heat, would seem prehistoric. The leap from 1870 to 1940 was transformative; the steps since, far less so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transport speeds have flatlined: just 66 years separated Kitty Hawk from the moon landing, yet half a century later, cars and planes still move at twentieth-century velocities. The energy sector has shown similar inertia, with fossil fuels still providing more than 80 percent of global supply—virtually unchanged since the 1970s, despite trillions invested in renewable energy sources. Longevity has plateaued as life expectancy gains in advanced economies have slowed or even reversed. The number of scientists has risen more than fortyfold since the 1930s, yet research productivity has declined by roughly the same margin, now halving every 13 years. Business R &amp;amp; D has more than doubled as a share of GDP since 1980, but productivity growth and startup formation have each fallen by half in advanced economies. Even the digital revolution has proved fleeting; after a brief surge in the late 1990s, productivity growth sank back to historic lows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Today’s technologies have not remade life as the Industrial Revolution did.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some forecasts claim that artificial intelligence will turbocharge global output by 30 percent per year, but most economists expect it to add only about one percentage point to annual growth. AI excels at digital tasks, yet the toughest labor bottlenecks are in physical and social realms. Hospitals need nurses more than they need faster scans; restaurants need cooks more than ordering tablets; lawyers must persuade judges, not just parse briefs. Robots remain clumsy in real-world settings, and because machine learning is probabilistic, errors are inevitable—so humans must often stay in the loop. Reflecting these limits, roughly 80 percent of firms using generative AI reported that it had no material effect on their profits, in a McKinsey Global Survey on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if AI keeps advancing, major productivity gains may take decades because economies must reorganize around new tools. That offers little relief for today’s struggling economies. Global growth has slowed from four percent in the first decades of the twenty-first century to about three percent today—and to barely one percent in advanced economies. Productivity growth, which ran at three to four percent annually in the 1950s and 1960s, has fallen close to zero. Meanwhile, global debt has swollen from 200 percent of GDP 15 years ago to 250 percent today, topping 300 percent in some advanced economies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demographic outlook is equally bleak. Today, nearly two-thirds of humanity lives in countries with birthrates below replacement levels. Most industrialized nations are literally dying powers, shrinking by hundreds of thousands each year—some by millions—and emerging markets are not far behind. Only sub-Saharan Africa still has high fertility, and rates are declining even there. Recent estimates suggest that the global population will begin falling in the 2050s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implications for national power are stark. As labor forces contract and retiree ranks swell, growth in major economies is projected to decline by at least 15 percent over the next quarter century, and for some, the hit will be several times worse. Making up that loss would require productivity gains of two to five percent a year—the breakneck pace of the 1950s—or longer workweeks, neither of which is realistic amid slowing innovation and mass retirement. Demographic decline also rules out any phoenix-like recovery. In the industrial era, even countries shattered by war could roar back: Germany after World War I, the Soviet Union and Japan after World War II, and China after its “century of humiliation” all returned bigger and stronger within a generation. Today, as populations shrink, lost power may be gone for good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With neither economic growth nor demographic revival to count on, conquest might seem the last path to rising power. Yet that route, too, is narrowing. The spread of industrial technologies—railroads, telegraphs, and electrification—facilitated state building and decolonization, quadrupling the number of nation-states in the world since 1900. Since then, more than 160 foreign occupations have been mired in insurgencies, as cheap rifles, mortars, and rocket-propelled grenades turned villages into kill zones. Nuclear weapons raised the risks of conquest to existential levels, while precision-guided munitions and drones now allow even ragtag militias such as the Houthis to cripple ships and tanks. Meanwhile, the spoils of conquest have shrunk: land and minerals once enriched empires, but today nearly 90 percent of corporate assets in advanced economies are intangible—software, patents, and brands that cannot be plundered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For aspiring great powers in the developing world, the climb is steeper still. Multinational companies from wealthy states dominate capital and technology, while global production has become modular, consigning latecomers to low-value roles—assembling goods or exporting raw materials—without a chance to build globally competitive firms of their own. Foreign aid has dwindled, export markets are contracting, and protectionism is spreading, pulling up the export-led ladder that past risers once climbed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical churn has slowed dramatically. With few exceptions, the countries that were rich and powerful in 1980 remain so today, while most of the poor have stayed poor. Between 1850 and 1949, five new great powers stormed onto the scene, but in the 75 years since, only China has. And it may be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MIND THE GAP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the world’s preeminent power, the United States sets the pace against which others rise or fall—and at the start of the twenty-first century, that pace was abysmal. In 2001, the country suffered the deadliest attack on its homeland. Over the next decade, it fought two of the three longest wars in its history, costing hundreds of thousands of lives, including those of thousands of Americans, and spending $8 trillion, without securing victory. In 2008, it suffered the worst financial collapse since the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other economies closed the gap. Between 2000 and 2010, China’s GDP in dollar terms—the clearest gauge of a country’s purchasing power on international markets—jumped from 12 percent to 41 percent of U.S. GDP. Russia’s share quadrupled; Brazil’s and India’s more than doubled; and Europe’s major economies also made meaningful gains. To many observers, these shifts heralded an epic power transition—what the writer Fareed Zakaria memorably called “the rise of the rest,” ushering in an allegedly “post-American world.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;China may be the last new great power to storm onto the scene.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the tide soon turned. In the 2010s, most major economies fell back. Brazil’s and Japan’s shares of U.S. GDP were cut roughly in half. Canada, France, Italy, and Russia each lost about a third of their relative economic weight, while Germany’s and the United Kingdom’s shares contracted by about a quarter. Only China and India continued to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2020s have been harsher still. India is the only major economy still keeping pace with the United States. From 2020 to 2024, China’s GDP fell from 70 to 64 percent of U.S. GDP. Japan’s plunged from 22 to 14 percent. The economies of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom all slid further, while Russia’s is sputtering after a brief wartime bump. The combined economies of the countries of Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia have also shrunk—from about 90 percent of U.S. GDP a decade ago to just 70 percent in 2023. “The rise of the rest” has not merely slowed; it is reversing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nor is a comeback likely. The apparent rise of new powers in the early years of the twenty-first century was always misleading because GDP is a crude measure of strength. What matters more are the foundations of a robust economy—productivity, innovation, consumer markets, energy, finance, and fiscal health—and on those fronts, most challengers are faltering. Over the past decade, only India and the United States have gained in total factor productivity, which measures how efficiently a country translates labor, capital, and other inputs into economic output. Japan has stagnated while others have slid backward, throwing in more inputs but producing less growth. In advanced industries, the gap is wider: U.S. firms capture more than half of global high-tech profits; China barely manages six percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States’ advantages extend further. Its consumer market is now larger than China’s and the eurozone’s combined. It is the world’s second-largest trader, yet it is among the least trade-dependent, with exports making up just 11 percent of GDP—one-third of which goes to Canada and Mexico—compared with 20 percent for China and 30 percent globally. In energy, it has vaulted from net importer to top producer, enjoying prices far below those of rivals. And the dollar continues to dominate reserves, banking, and foreign exchange. Total public and private debt in the United States is enormous—about 250 percent of GDP in 2024 and likely to climb with the extended tax cuts Congress passed in July—but still lower than that of many peers: in Japan, it exceeds 380 percent; in France, 320 percent; and in China, it tops 300 percent once hidden local government and corporate liabilities are included. Moreover, from 2015 to 2025, debt in the United States edged down slightly, while it rose nearly 60 percentage points in China, more than 25 in Japan and Brazil, and nearly 20 in France.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“The rise of the rest” has not merely slowed; it is reversing.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demographics will further drag down U.S. rivals. Over the next 25 years, the United States will gain about eight million working-age adults (a 3.7 percent increase), while China will lose roughly 240 million (a 24.5 percent decline)—more than the entire labor force of the European Union. Japan will shed about 18 million workers (25.5 percent of its labor force), Russia more than 11 million (12.2 percent), Italy around 10 million (27.5 percent), Brazil another 10 million (7.1 percent), and Germany over 8 million (15.6 percent). Aging will compound the pain. During the same period, the United States will add about 24 million retirees (a 37.8 percent increase over today), but China will add more than 178 million (an 84.5 percent increase). Japan, already saturated with seniors, will gain 2.5 million retirees (a 6.7 percent increase). Germany will add 3.8 million (up 19 percent), Italy 4.3 million (up 29 percent), Russia 6.8 million (up 27 percent), and Brazil 24.5 million (up a staggering 100 percent). For two centuries, rising powers were propelled by swelling youth populations; today, major economies are losing workers while piling up retirees—a double blow that no challenger has ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the United States, only India—the world’s most populous country, with a workforce projected to grow into the 2040s—seems to be partly shielded from demographic decline, raising its hopes to be the next rising power. Yet India suffers from a crippling dearth of skilled workers. As of 2020, nearly a quarter of working-age adults had never attended school, and among those who did, four out of five lacked basic math and science skills. In total, nearly 90 percent of young people fall short of essential literacy and numeracy. The problem is magnified by brain drain: India sends more skilled migrants to advanced economies than any other country. One study tracking the 2010 cohort of India’s Joint Entrance Examination takers—the gateway to elite technology institutions—found that within eight years, more than a third of the top 1,000 scorers had moved abroad, including over 60 percent of the top 100.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Indian economy amplifies these weaknesses. Labor and industry remain constrained: more than 80 percent of workers are in the untaxable informal sector, and nearly half of all industrial sectors have contracted since 2015. Infrastructure and trade are also limited: India’s busiest port handles only one-seventh the volume of China’s, and a quarter of the country’s trade with Europe and East Asia must pass through foreign hubs, adding three days in transit and roughly $200 to the cost of every container. Finally, the heralded services sector is narrow, with growth concentrated in IT firms that cannot absorb a vast labor force, leaving about 40 percent of college graduates in their 20s unemployed. India will remain consequential—its market large, its military strong by regional standards, its diaspora influential—but it lacks the foundations for true great-power ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CHINA’S GAMBLE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If any country can defy today’s headwinds, it is China. It produces a third of the world’s goods and turns out more ships, electric vehicles, batteries, rare-earth minerals, solar panels, and pharmaceutical ingredients than the rest of the world combined. Industrial hubs such as Shenzhen and Hefei can take a design from prototype to mass production in days, powered by the planet’s largest electric grid and a vast robot workforce. Beijing bankrolls research, directs firms, and stockpiles resources, while its AI strategy prizes rapid, low-cost deployment. Scale gives China leverage. It can flood markets to bankrupt competitors, as it did with solar panels, and churn out strategic goods—from drones to ships to rare earths—faster than any rival. On the asset side of the ledger, China looks unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the liability side, however, China’s position is far weaker. Its growth model rests on three perilous bets: that gross output matters more than net returns, that a few showcase industries can substitute for broad economic vitality, and that autocracy can deliver more dynamism than democracy. These gambles have generated spectacular output, but at mounting costs—and history shows that such liabilities are usually decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two centuries, states with deeper net resources—what remained after providing for their people, sustaining their economies, and securing their homelands—prevailed in 70 percent of disputes, 80 percent of wars, and every great-power rivalry. Nineteenth-century China and Russia looked imposing on paper, with the largest economies in Eurasia, but their liability-ridden empires were repeatedly outmatched by smaller, more efficient rivals: Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In the twentieth century, the Soviet Union funneled vast resources into strategic sectors, spending nearly twice as much as the United States on R &amp;amp; D as a share of GDP and employing nearly twice as many scientists and engineers, while pumping out steel, machine tools, nuclear technology, and oil, gas, and other raw materials. It built giant dams and railways and leapt out to an early lead in the space race. Yet these feats produced islands of excellence in a sea of stagnation, and the Soviet Union ultimately collapsed not for lack of megaprojects but because its broader economy rotted away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China today is running into a similar trap. Its investment-driven model relies on ever-larger inputs to generate ever-smaller returns, with each unit of output now requiring two to three times more capital and four times more labor than in the United States. To keep headline growth going, Beijing has flooded the system with credit, creating more than $30 trillion in new bank assets since 2008. By 2024, its banking system had swollen to $59 trillion—equal to three times its GDP and more than half of global GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of this debt is sunk in empty apartments, loss-making factories, and bad loans—assets that look like wealth on paper but are really IOUs that may never be paid. Property and construction, once nearly 30 percent of the economy, have imploded, erasing an estimated $18 trillion in household wealth since 2020. The blow to Chinese citizens has been harsher than that which hit Americans in 2008 because Chinese families had invested more than twice as much of their net worth in real estate. With many middle-class households stripped of their life savings, disposable income has stalled at $5,800 per person and consumption at 39 percent of GDP—roughly half the U.S. level and far below what Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan sustained during their industrial booms. Demand has cratered, and prices have now dropped for nine straight quarters, the longest deflationary slump any major economy has suffered in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another liability is human capital. While Beijing lavished funds on infrastructure, it neglected its people. Only one-third of working-age adults have finished high school—the lowest share among middle-income countries. By contrast, when South Korea and Taiwan were at China’s income level in the late 1980s, roughly 70 percent of their workers had high school degrees, a foundation that enabled them to move from assembly lines into advanced industries and achieve high-income status. In rural China, malnutrition and poverty push many children to drop out by middle school. The result, as the economist Scott Rozelle has shown, is hundreds of millions of young workers unprepared for a modern economy, just as the low-skill construction jobs that once absorbed them disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demographics and fiscal strain compound the pressure. If China’s elderly formed a country, it would be the world’s fourth largest and fastest growing—nearly 300 million today, projected to exceed 500 million by 2050. By then, just two workers will support each retiree, down from ten in 2000. Yet the safety net is threadbare. Pensions cover only half the workforce and will run dry by 2035. Eldercare is weaker still. China has only 29 nurses per 10,000 people, compared with 115 in Japan and 70 in South Korea. And a withering workforce is shrinking the government’s revenue base: tax receipts have fallen from 18.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to under 14 percent in 2022—less than half the average among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;What looms is a reprise of some of the worst aspects of the twentieth century.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beijing hopes to boost its economy by subsidizing strategic industries. But those sectors are too small to offset the collapse of real estate—electric vehicles, batteries, and renewables together made up barely 3.5 percent of GDP in 2023—and many are becoming liabilities themselves. Subsidies have spawned gluts, price wars, and “zombie” industrial zones reminiscent of the ghost cities of the property bust. China’s automakers churn out twice the number of cars the domestic market can absorb, and nearly triple the number of EVs. Solar firms added 1,000 gigawatts of capacity in 2023—five times the rest of the world combined—pushing prices below cost. High-speed rail has piled up about a trillion dollars in debt, with most lines running at a loss. Nearly a quarter of Chinese industrial firms are now unprofitable, the highest share since 2001 and almost double the share a decade ago, while the country’s top five tech giants have shed $1.3 trillion in market value since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And despite more than a trillion dollars in subsidies over the past decade, China still depends on the United States and U.S. allies for 70 to 100 percent of some 400 critical goods and technologies. Semiconductor chips, for example, have surpassed crude oil as the country’s largest import, yet domestic production covers less than one-fifth of demand. At the cutting edge, China is almost entirely reliant on foreign suppliers. After Washington’s 2022 export controls on AI chips, the U.S. share of global AI computing power jumped nearly 50 percent while China’s was cut in half, leaving the United States with a fivefold lead. That episode underscored what the scholars Stephen Brooks and Benjamin Vagle have called “excludable commercial power”: across R &amp;amp; D–intensive industries, the United States and its allies capture more than 80 percent of global revenues. In normal times, that dominance yields market power; in a crisis, it becomes a weapon—China could lose 14 to 21 percent of GDP in a trade cutoff, compared with just four to seven percent for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities are compounded by China’s political system. The Chinese Communist Party has turned autocracy into an economic straitjacket, tightening its grip on the private sector and steering capital toward politically connected firms. Venture-backed startups have plunged from roughly 51,000 in 2018 to barely 1,200 in 2023, according to reporting by the Financial Times. Foreign investment has dropped to a three-decade low, while capital flight has risen, with tens of thousands of millionaires and hundreds of billions of dollars leaving each year. The result is a brittle economy—formidable assets on the surface, but festering liabilities below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GATHERING STORMS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The age of rising powers is ending, and the fallout is already fueling conflict. One threat is that stagnating states are militarizing to reclaim “lost” territories and maintain great-power status. Russia has already rolled the dice in Ukraine and, if unchecked, could set its sights on wealthier neighbors such as the Baltic States or Poland. China might attempt something similar against Taiwan. For these once rising powers now facing stagnation, conquest can look tempting—a way to seize resources and respect, absorb populations in some cases nearly twice as wealthy per capita as they are, and allow their leaders to pose as empire builders rather than stewards of decline. Fear sharpens the impulse, as Western prosperity threatens to lure away borderlands and incite unrest at home. Both Russian President Vladimir Putin, haunted by the Soviet collapse in the 1990s, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, wary of a repeat of the 1989 nationwide protests that culminated in the Tiananmen Square crackdown, stoke anti-Americanism and revanchism to shore up their rule—and with success. Russians endure staggering losses in Putin’s war in Ukraine for cash payouts and patriotic spectacles, while China channels unemployed youth into nationalist boycotts and celebrations of Xi’s promised rejuvenation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia and China have quintupled military spending relative to the United States and its allies since 2000, echoing earlier cases when embattled powers—Depression-era Germany and Japan, the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s—poured resources into arms, betting that if they could no longer buy influence with growth, they could bludgeon their way to dominance instead. Precision weapons and drones give small states new tools of defense, but they may also convince Putin and Xi that quick victories are possible. In a dictator’s echo chamber, what looks suicidal to ordinary people can feel like destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another threat is rampant state failure among debt-ridden countries with fast-growing populations. In the nineteenth century, industrialization turned demographic growth into economic dividends by moving peasants into factories. That path is now closed. Manufacturing is commodified, automated, and dominated by incumbents, leaving latecomers stuck in low-value niches. Sub-Saharan Africa still has only 11.5 percent of its workforce in industry, barely more than it had three decades ago. India’s 2014 “Make in India” campaign promised a manufacturing takeoff, but the sector’s share of GDP has stalled at around 17 percent, and its share of jobs has shrunk. In the Middle East, oil rents have funded urban modernization but not broad-based industrialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many poor countries have reaped the life-expectancy gains of modernity but without an economic revolution, turning population growth into a liability. The UN has estimated that 3.3 billion people now live in countries where interest payments on debt exceed investment in health or education. Since 2015, GDP per capita has flatlined across much of Africa and the Middle East, savings and investment have collapsed, and youth unemployment tops 60 percent in some countries. These pressures are fueling turmoil: roughly a third of African states are in active conflict, and jihadist violence in the Sahel has exploded since 2015, with extremist groups such as Boko Haram and affiliates of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (or ISIS) operating across more than a dozen countries. As people flee from the turmoil, migration has soared. As of June 2024, the UN Refugee Agency counted more than 120 million people forcibly displaced worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spiral of state failure could magnify a third threat: the advance of antiliberalism within democracies themselves. After the Syrian war drove nearly a million refugees to Europe, ethnonationalist parties surged across the continent. A similar shift has unfolded in the United States amid record migration at the southern border during the Biden administration. Public trust in government has collapsed—falling in the United States from nearly 80 percent in the 1960s to about 20 percent today—while automation and inequality have hollowed out middle classes and inflamed identity politics. Authoritarian powers exploit these fissures: Russia bankrolls and amplifies extremist movements, China exports surveillance tools, and both flood their Western adversaries with disinformation. Liberal democracy has historically thrived in eras of growth, opportunity, and cohesion. It is far less clear whether it can withstand an age of stagnation, mass migration, and digital subversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As liberal democracy corrodes at home, liberal internationalism is unraveling abroad. In a world without rising powers, the United States is becoming a rogue superpower, with little sense of obligation beyond itself. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership was one part virtue, three parts self-interest: protecting allies, transferring technology, and opening up the U.S. markets were the price of containing a rising rival. Allies publicly accepted U.S. primacy because the Red Army loomed nearby and communism commanded hundreds of millions of adherents. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, the demand for U.S. leadership collapsed with it. Today, with no Red Menace to fight and only an amorphous liberal order to defend, the phrase “leader of the free world” rings hollow even to American ears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, U.S. strategy is shedding values and historical memory, narrowing its focus to money and homeland defense. Allies are discovering what unvarnished unilateralism feels like, as security guarantees become protection rackets and trade deals are enforced with tariffs. This is the same logic of raw power that helped spur two world wars, and the consequences are already visible. Multilateral institutions are paralyzed, arms control regimes are collapsing, and economic nationalism has surged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What looms is not a multipolar concert of great powers sharing the world, but a reprise of some of the worst aspects of the twentieth century: struggling states militarizing, fragile ones collapsing, democracies rotting from within, and the supposed guarantor of order retreating into parochial self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;SILVER LININGS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If today’s dangers can be managed, however, the end of rising powers could ultimately produce a brighter future. For centuries, the rise and fall of great powers unleashed the bloodiest wars in history. Without new challengers, the world may finally gain reprieve from the most destructive cycle of all: hegemonic rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the political scientist Graham Allison has noted, in the past 250 years there have been ten cases of a rising power confronting a ruling one. Seven ended in carnage. One can debate his case selection, but the basic pattern is clear: rising powers have sparked a catastrophic war roughly once a generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A world without rising powers will not end conflict, but it may lift the specter of those system-shattering struggles. Violence will persist—stagnation and state collapse could even make local conflicts more frequent—but such clashes are unlikely to carry the global scope, ideological zeal, generational duration, and apocalyptic potential of hegemonic contests. Shrinking populations and slowing economies could sap the ambition and capacity for continental conquest—or for a rebound, once faltering powers stumble. A less dynamic world may also yield a more pragmatic contest between liberal and authoritarian-kleptocratic systems rather than the totalizing crusades of fascism and communism, which emerged from industrialization’s upheaval and sought to remake humanity. History will not end, but its most catastrophic chapter might.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That restraint may be reinforced by what the political scientist Mark Haas calls a “geriatric peace.” Aging societies face ballooning welfare costs, shrinking pools of military-age recruits, and risk-averse electorates. On the eve of World War I, the median age of the major powers was in the mid-20s. Today, it exceeds 40 in every great power except the United States (which is just under 40), and within a decade, a quarter or more of their citizens will be seniors. A century ago, young societies stormed into world wars; in the twenty-first, gray powers may be too weary and wise to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a world without rising powers proves calmer geopolitically, economics may also be brighter than expected. Even without another industrial revolution, new technologies are improving daily life, and humanity is healthier and more educated than ever. Slower productivity growth and aging populations may temper GDP, but they need not prevent a quieter revolution in living standards, creating a future in which societies grow richer in knowledge and healthier in body even as they grow smaller in population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another source of optimism lies in today’s demographic asymmetry. Advanced economies are capital-rich but labor-poor, while much of the developing world—especially Africa—has the reverse profile. In principle, this sets the stage for a new division of labor: aging societies supply savings and technology, and younger ones supply workers, creating a symbiosis that could sustain global growth even as individual nations slow. The flow of remittances, skills partnerships, and cross-border investment are early signs of this new relationship, and digital platforms are easing coordination. Yet none of this is automatic. The politics of trade and migration are turning inward, and absorbing large migrant flows without disrupting societies remains a daunting challenge. Without careful management—rules-based migration channels, secure borders, worker protections, and new models of remote collaboration—what could be a growth pact may instead collapse into backlash. The opportunity is real, but so are the obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forecasting is a perilous business. Demography can be measured, but technology and politics often surprise, and today’s certainties may look naive a generation or even a few years from now. What can be said with confidence is that for two and a half centuries, global politics was driven by the rapid rise of great powers, and the forces that made such ascents possible are now receding. That does not guarantee stability, but it does mark a profound shift: the familiar struggle between living and dying powers is winding down, and another story, its outlines still obscure, is beginning to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sentence Transformers is joining Hugging Face!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we are announcing that Sentence Transformers is transitioning from Iryna Gurevych’s Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab at the TU Darmstadt to Hugging Face. Hugging Face's Tom Aarsen has already been maintaining the library since late 2023 and will continue to lead the project. At its new home, Sentence Transformers will benefit from Hugging Face's robust infrastructure, including continuous integration and testing, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the latest advancements in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SentenceBERT or SBERT) is a popular open-source library for generating high-quality embeddings that capture semantic meaning. Since its inception by Nils Reimers in 2019, Sentence Transformers has been widely adopted by researchers and practitioners for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including semantic search, semantic textual similarity, clustering, and paraphrase mining. After years of development and training by and for the community, over 16,000 Sentence Transformers models are publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub, serving more than a million monthly unique users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Sentence Transformers has been a huge success story and a culmination of our long-standing research on computing semantic similarities for the whole lab. Nils Reimers has made a very timely discovery and has produced not only outstanding research outcomes, but also a highly usable tool. This continues to impact generations of students and practitioners in natural language processing and AI. I would also like to thank all the users and especially the contributors, without whom this project would not be what it is today. And finally, I would like to thank Tom and Hugging Face for taking the project into the future."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych, Director of the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We're thrilled to officially welcome Sentence Transformers into the Hugging Face family! Over the past two years, it’s been amazing to see this project grow to massive global adoption, thanks to the incredible foundation from the UKP Lab and the amazing community around it. This is just the beginning: we’ll keep doubling down on supporting its growth and innovation, while staying true to the open, collaborative spirit that made it thrive in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clem Delangue, co-founder &amp;amp; CEO, Hugging Face&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sentence Transformers will remain a community-driven, open-source project, with the same open-source license (Apache 2.0) as before. Contributions from researchers, developers, and enthusiasts are welcome and encouraged. The project will continue to prioritize transparency, collaboration, and broad accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Project History&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sentence Transformers library was introduced in 2019 by Dr. Nils Reimers at the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab at Technische Universität Darmstadt, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych. Motivated by the limitations of standard BERT embeddings for sentence-level semantic tasks, Sentence-BERT used a Siamese network architecture to produce semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that could be efficiently compared using cosine similarity. Thanks to its modular, open-source design and strong empirical performance on tasks such as semantic textual similarity, clustering, and information retrieval, the library quickly became a staple in the NLP research toolkit, spawning a range of follow-up work and real-world applications that rely on high-quality sentence representations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, multilingual support was added to the library, extending sentence embeddings to more than 400 languages. In 2021, with contributions from Nandan Thakur and Dr. Johannes Daxenberger, the library expanded to support pair-wise sentence scoring using Cross Encoder and Sentence Transformer models. Sentence Transformers was also integrated with the Hugging Face Hub (v2.0). For over four years, the UKP Lab team maintained the library as a community-driven open-source project and provided continued research-driven innovation. During this period, the project's development was supported by grants to Prof. Gurevych by the German Research Foundation (DFG), German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), and Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts (HMWK).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2023, Tom Aarsen from Hugging Face took over maintainership of the library, introducing modernized training for Sentence Transformer models (v3.0), as well as improvements of Cross Encoder (v4.0) and Sparse Encoder (v5.0) models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab at Technische Universität Darmstadt, led by Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych, is internationally recognized for its research in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The lab has a long track record of pioneering work in representation learning, large language models, and information retrieval, with numerous publications at leading conferences and journals. Beyond Sentence Transformers, the UKP Lab has developed a number of widely used datasets, benchmarks, and open-source tools that support both academic research and real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hugging Face would like to thank the UKP Lab and all past and present contributors, especially Dr. Nils Reimers and Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych, for their dedication to the project and for entrusting us with its maintenance and now stewardship. We also extend our gratitude to the community of researchers, developers, and practitioners who have contributed to the library's success through model contributions, bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and real-world applications. We are excited to continue building on the strong foundation laid by the UKP Lab and to work with the community to further advance the capabilities of Sentence Transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/head&gt;
