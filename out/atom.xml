    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The future is (still) now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The premier UX of the 21st century just got a little better: With &lt;code&gt;chafa&lt;/code&gt;,
  you can now view very, very reasonable approximations
  of pictures and animations in the comfort of your
  favorite terminal emulator. The power of ANSI X3.64 compels you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can get fair results by using only U+2580 (upper half block). Other terminal graphics packages do this, and so can Chafa with &lt;code&gt;chafa --symbols vhalf&lt;/code&gt;. However, Chafa
uses more symbols by default, greatly improving quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are more examples in the gallery!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supports most popular image formats, including animated GIFs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outputs to all popular terminal graphics formats: Sixels, Kitty, iTerm2, Unicode mosaics.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combines Unicode symbols from multiple selectable ranges for optimal output.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fullwidth character support, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Glyphs can be loaded from any font file supported by Freetype (TTF, OTF, PCF, etc).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple color modes, including Truecolor, 256-color, 16-color and simple FG/BG.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RGB and DIN99d color spaces for improved color picking.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alpha transparency support in any color mode, including in animations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works with most modern and classic terminals and terminal emulators.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Documented, stable C API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fast &amp;amp; lean: SIMD optimized, multithreaded.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Suitable for terminal graphics, ANSI art composition and even black &amp;amp; white print.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the features are discussed in a series of blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Introducing Chafa&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The worst ANSI art renderer, except for all the others&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chafa 1.2.0: Faster than ever, now with 75% more grit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chafa 1.4.0: Now with sixels&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chafa 1.6.0: Wider&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chafa 1.8: Terminal graphics with a side of everything&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chafa 1.14: All-singing, all-dancing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Documentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chafa will print a help text if run without arguments, or with &lt;code&gt;chafa --help&lt;/code&gt;.
It also comes with a man page displayable with &lt;code&gt;man chafa&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gallery contains examples of how command-line options can be used to tweak the output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is C API documentation for application developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Erica Ferrua EdwardsdÃ³ttir is developing Python bindings that allow Chafa to be used in Python programs. These are documented on their own site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HÃ©ctor Molinero FernÃ¡ndez maintains JavaScript bindings that allow Chafa to be used in Node.js, web browsers, and more. These are documented on their own site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Community&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please bring your questions to our &lt;del&gt;secret business&lt;/del&gt; friendly Matrix chat. Stay a while and listen, or talk about terminals, software or your choice of breakfast cereal. All are welcome, but an appreciation for terminals, programming and/or computer graphics is likely to enhance your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the chat's history is hidden from non-members, this is a public forum, so if your ambition is to overthrow the government/megacorps by way of an underground network of refurbished Minitels, you may want to keep it under your hat. Furthermore, and hopefully obviously, we treat our fellow humans with respect. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;D-Bus is a disgrace to the Linux desktop&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;15 XII 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;32.8k&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; I will be adding stuff there if more FAQs pop up. Thanks! &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D-Bus was introduced by GNOME folks about 20 years ago. For software made only 20 years ago, as opposed to 40 like X, it's surprisingly almost equally as bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a service, D-Bus is incredibly handy and useful, and overall, I believe the idea should absolutely be used by more apps. However, the implementation... oh boy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone has heard about D-Bus, but what is it, actually?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D-Bus' idea is pretty simple: let applications, services and other things expose methods or properties in a way that other apps can find them in one place, on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say we have a service that monitors the weather. Instead of each app knowing how to talk to each weather service, or even worse, implementing one itself, it can connect to the bus, and see if any service on the system exposes some weather API, then use it to get weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, right? And yeah, the idea is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D-Bus is a lenient, unorganized and forgiving bus. Those three add to one of the biggest, fundamental, and conceptual blunders to any protocol, language or system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important blunders are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this means in practice is the definition of "Garbage in, garbage out".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, apps need to communicate, right? Well, in some way right? Where do we find the way?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uhh... somewhere online, probably. Nobody actually knows because some of them are here, some there, many are unfinished, unreadable, or convoluted garbage docs, and no client follows them anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at some gems. These are actual docs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Truly secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess service implementors should learn telepathy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So is it a draft or widely used?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D-Bus standards are a mess. And that's if we assume that implementors on both sides actually follow them (they often don't, as we will learn in a moment...)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, let's say we have a standard and we understand it. Great! Now...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;nobody gives a shit, literally. Even if you read a spec, nothing, literally nothing, guides, ensures, or helps you stick to it. NOTHING. You send anonymous calls with whatever bullshit you want to throw in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back when I was writing xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, I had to use a few dbus protocols (xdg portals run on dbus) to implement some of the communication. If we go to the portal documentation, we can find the protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great! So I implemented it. It worked more-or-less. Then, I implemented restore tokens, which allow the app to restore its previously saved share configuration. And here, dbus falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the apps, I repeat, fucking none followed the spec. I wrote a spec-compliant mechanism and nothing fucking used it. Why? Simple, they all used a different spec, which came out of fucking nowhere, I legit couldn't find a single doc with it. What I ended up doing was I looked at KDE which already had an impl and mimic'd that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the actual fuck. "Spec" my ass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: THIS IS STILL THE CASE! The spec advertises a "restore_token" string prop on SelectSources and Start, where no app does this and uses "restore_data" in "options".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me just say one word: variants. What in the actual, everloving fuck? Half of D-Bus protocols have either this BS, or some "a{sv}" (array of string + variant) passed somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting something like this, even allowing that in a core spec should be subject to a permanent ban from creating software. What this allows, and even incentivises, is for apps to send random shit over the wire and hope the other side understands it. (see the example above in part 2, prime dbus) This has been tried many times, most notably in X with atoms, and it has time and time again proven to only bring disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever heard of permissions? Neither have D-Bus developers. D-Bus is as insecure as it gets. Everybody sees everything and calls whatever. If the app doesn't have a specific security mechanism, cowabunga it is. Furthermore, there is no such thing as a "rejection" in a universal sense. Either the protocol invents its own "rejection" or just... something happens, god knows what, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one of the prime reasons flatpak apps can not see your session bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever seen kwallet or gnome-keyring? Yeah, these things. These are supposed to be "secret storage" for things like signing keys, passwords, etc. They can be protected by a password, which means they are secure... right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. No, they aren't. These secrets may be encrypted on disk, which technically prevents them from being stolen if your laptop is stolen. If you just cringed at that because disk encryption has been a thing for 20 years now or so, you're not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the best thing is this: any app on the bus can read all secrets in the store if the store is unlocked. No, this is not a fucking joke. Once you input that password, any app can just read all of them without you noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the real stance of GNOME developers on the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I am at a loss of words as to how to describe this without being extremely rude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security so good microsoft might steal it for their recall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've had enough of D-Bus in my apps. I would greatly benefit from a session (and later, system) bus for my ecosystem, but I will not stand the absolute shitfest that D-Bus is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why, I've decided to take matters into my own hands. I am writing a new bus. From the ground up, with zero copying, interop, or other recognition of D-Bus. There are so many stupid ideas crammed into D-Bus that I do not wish to have any of them poison my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people quote this xkcd comic for each new implementation. However, this is not exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, with wayland, when you switch, you abandon X. You cannot run an X11 session together with a wayland one, simply not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can, however, run two session buses. Or three. Or 17. Nothing stops you. That's why gradual migration is absolutely possible. Sure, these buses can't talk to each other, but you can also create a proxy client that can "translate" dbus APIs into new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I focused on was hyprwire. I needed a wire protocol anyways for hypr* stuff like hyprlauncher, hyprpaper, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wire protocol is inspired by how Wayland decided to handle things. Its most important strengths are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyprwire is already used for IPC in hyprpaper, hyprlauncher and parts of hyprctl, and has been serving us well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bus is called hyprtavern, as it is not exactly what D-Bus is, but it's more like a tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps register objects on the bus, which have exposed protocols and key properties defined by the protocols. These objects can be discovered by other apps connecting to the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a sense, hyprtavern acts like a tavern, where each app is a client, that can advertise the languages they speak, but also go up to someone else and strike up a conversation if they have a language in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some overall improvements over D-Bus, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With relation to the Secrets API discussed a bit above, I wanted to mention kv.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;hyprtavern-kv is the default implementation of the core protocol for a kv store. A kv store is a "key-value" store, which means apps register values for "keys", e.g. "user_secret_key = password".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is essentially what D-Bus Secrets API does, but instead of being a security joke, it's actually secure by-design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any app can register secrets, which only it can read back. Secrets cannot be enumerated. This means that when "/usr/bin/firefox" sets a "passwords:superwebsite.com = animebooba", an app called "~/Downloads/totally_legit.sh" can not see the value, or the key, or that firefox even set anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also (will) work with Flatpak, Snap and AppImage applications by additionally using their Flatpak ID, Snap ID or AppImage path respectively. This is not implemented, but planned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kv store is always encrypted, but a default password can be used which means it will be unlocked by default and the store file can be trivially decrypted. The difference is that if you set a password here, it will actually be secure, even if an app with access to the bus tries to steal all of the secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, this protocol is core. It must be implemented by the bus, which means all apps can benefit from a secure secret storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, absolutely not. I started work on it just recently, and I still need to cook a bit. It's coming though, really!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to get it widely used within hypr* by 0.54 of hyprland (that is the release after the upcoming 0.53).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, definitely not at the beginning. But, it's an easier transition than X11 -&amp;gt; Wayland, and I didn't expect Hyprland to be widely adopted either, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time will tell. All I can say is that it is just better than D-Bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An important part of adoption will probably be bindings to other languages. The libraries are all in C++, but since they aren't very big (by design), making Rust / Go / Python bindings shouldn't be hard for someone experienced with those languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wire format is also simple and open, so you could also write a Memory-Safeâ„¢ libhyprwire in Rust for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D-Bus has been an annoyance of mine for years now, but I finally have the ecosystem and resources to write something to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's hope we can make the userspace a bit nicer to work with :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is quickly gathering attention so I will answer some FAQs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Reinventing the wheel won't help&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wheel is fundamentally broken. D-Bus is unfixable due to its core principles being terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Where docs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I've said, hyprtavern is a heavy WIP. Once it is ready for app developers, which I hope to be done with within a month, I will write extensive docs about both the wire protocol (so that you can implement it yourself if you don't like libhyprwire) and the tavern itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Why not use wayland?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've implemented a few improvements to hyprwire for bus usage (e.g. array types), and additionally wayland is not meant to be a generic IPC protocol. Connecting is restricted to sockets and WAYLAND_DISPLAY, for example. One could fork it, but at this point, it's better to write your own impl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Can we add dbus-compatibility translators?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. You can write a for example hyprtavern-dbus-notification-proxy which sets up a dbus notification service and exposes the events as an appropriate tavern protocol. Worth noting of course such a protocol doesn't exist yet as I am working on the core spec atm. There will be though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Why C++ and not memory safe rust?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I am a C++ dev. You are free to reimplement the bus / wire in Rust. You are also free to write bindings. BSD-3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyprland (and related) historically have had less and less memory issues over time thanks to our shift to hyprutils and very common (almost religious) refcounting practices. However, nothing's stopping you from rewriting things in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The portal docs are actually correct, you just were reading the wrong ones&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, a person on hackernews named mahkoh pointed this out (thanks!). This doesn't change the fact that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Fragmentation, gnome and kde have different needs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hasn't stopped them from both using D-Bus to this day. Apparently you can have one bus for both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; What about symlinks in paths?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just resolve them. For chrooted apps, both Linux and BSD provide a way to get root from pid. I've been told it will break on Nix, but I will let the Nix folks figure this one out as I don't use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Where can we follow development or see the protocol?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyprwire's wire format is not yet documented, but it's quite simple. Docs will be written by me once tavern's ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the core tavern protocol spec WIP, please see here. Please note it's of course a WIP so breaking changes do happen as I try to accomodate more usecases. Feedback is welcome though, feel free to leave feedback if you're an app or DE developer with a specific usecase in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;“Super secure” MAGA-themed messaging app leaks everyone’s phone number&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Neither of us had prior experience developing mobile apps, but we thought, “Hey, we’re both smart. This shouldn’t be too difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Freedom Chat CEO Tanner Haas&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Background#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in the distant memory that is 2023, a new instant messaging app called Converso was launched. Converso made some pretty impressive claims about its security: it claimed to implement state of the art end-to-end encryption, to collect no metadata, and to use a decentralized architecture that involved no servers at all. Unfortunately, security researcher crnković did some basic reverse engineering and traffic analysis and found all of these claims to be completely baseless, with Converso collecting plenty of metadata on every message and using a third-party E2EE provider to store messages on bog standard centralized servers. Even more unfortunately, crnković also found that Converso implemented the (perfectly functional if used properly) Seald E2EE service in such a way that encrypted messages’ keys could be derived from publicly available information, and also uploaded a copy of every encrypted message to an open Firebase bucket, meaning every message ever sent on the service could be trivially read by anyone with an Internet connection. After being informed of the vulnerabilities, Converso initially released an update claiming to fix them, then withdrew from the App Store and Google Play to “address and improve the issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not one to give up after a setback, Converso CEO Tanner Haas took a break from self-publishing books on how to achieve and receive anything you want to regroup and relaunch, as well as to bless the world with a lessons learned blog post describing his decision to rebrand after realizing that “privacy concerns were primarily coming from conservative circles,” and imparting nuggets of wisdom such as “accept criticism and get better: don’t complain” and “ensure the product has been thoroughly tested and is ready for prime-time.” Presumably he hadn’t learned the first one yet when he responded to crnković’s responsible disclosure with vague legal threats and accusations of being a Signal shill. Let’s see how the second is going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Part 0: Setup#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, I start out by downloading the app from Google Play and running it while monitoring traffic with HTTP Toolkit. I quickly ran into Freedom Chat’s first security feature: as detailed on their website, the app “prevent[s] screenshots and screen recordings entirely with built-in screenshot protection,” perhaps to accomodate conservatives’ complicated relationship with screenshots. Screenshots aren’t really crucial to anything being discussed here, but I like to provide only the best blog posts to my tens of readers, so let’s hook the app with Frida and disable the FLAG_SECURE attribute. With that out of the way, the signup process works as expected for an instant messaging app - we type in a phone number, get texted a 2FA code, and enter it to create an account. We’re asked whether we want to create a PIN, which is apparently optional to log in on my own phone and required if we want to restore our account on another device, then get to the main UI of the app. There are two main features here: a Chat pane where we can start chats with contacts, and a Channels pane where we can subscribe to user-run microblogging channels à la Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Part 1: Exploration#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start out with the basics and have a conversation with a second account. Sending a text message triggers the following exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head title="Click to interact"&gt;/message request&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the encrypted and Base64-encoded text we sent, along with some metadata for things like read receipts and editing and the identifiers needed for decryption (they’re using the same Seald backend that Converso had, without uploading everything to Firebase this time). Sending a photo and a voice message yields similar results. While verifying that they’re using Seald properly this time would require painstakingly decompiling and reverse engineering React Native’s Hermes VM bytecode, at a high level this seems fine. Let’s move on to the Channels feature. When we open the tab, we see that we’ve already been added to a Freedom Chat channel, which mostly posts about updates to the app and related media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also suggested a handful of other channels to join, including that of Tanner Haas and some people who are apparently conservative influencers. Tanner mostly seems to use his to post fascinating political takes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Part 2: Leaking everyone’s PIN#&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;members&lt;/code&gt; array has 1519 entries in that format, apparently one for each member of the channel. What’s going on in that &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; object? The &lt;code&gt;pin&lt;/code&gt; field seems suspiciously related to the PIN we were asked to input after creating our account… To confirm, we can sort the array by &lt;code&gt;createdAt&lt;/code&gt; and find that the most recent entry does indeed have the PIN we just set when making our account. So
anyone who’s in a channel (i.e. anyone who hasn’t left the default Freedom Chat channel) has their PIN broadcast to every other user! There’s no direct link between PINs and phone numbers here, but this is still not great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Part 3: So much more secure than WhatsApp#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we scroll back a bit in the Freedom Chat channel, we see this message dunking on WhatsApp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability they’re talking about was presented in a paper by researchers at the University of Vienna. The paper is interesting and you should go read it, but to summarize, WhatsApp failed to rate limit the API that eats up every phone number in your contacts and checks whether they also use WhatsApp or not. Researchers were thus able to test nearly every possible phone number in the world, and end up with a dump of every WhatsApp user’s phone number, along with some other metadata. It’s interesting that Freedom Chat isn’t vulnerable to this, because they have the same contact discovery feature WhatsApp does, with the app offering you to either start a chat or invite each of your contacts depending on whether they already have an account:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s find out for ourselves. When we open this contacts page, the following request-response happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head title="Click to interact"&gt;/user/numbers request&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;METHOD: POST

  }
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first two numbers in the request are the two we used to register Freedom Chat accounts. The third is a number we didn’t register, as a control. A couple things are interesting here. Most obviously, this is exactly the WhatsApp API the Vienna researchers exploited, and will contain the same vulnerability if not rate limited. This endpoint also provides a linkage between phone numbers and UIDs - if we could run every registered phone number through it, we could get each number’s UID and match it to the UIDs in the Channels response to get that number’s PIN, entirely defeating the PIN mechanism. Now we just need to test whether it’s rate limited&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is pretty self-explanatory. We generate every valid 7-digit North American phone number, then for every area code, send every number in batches of 40000, plus a number we registered so we can check for false empty responses. We log responses that don’t contain the string “uid” exactly once; if a response contains it 0 times it has failed to produce our registered number and is thus faulty somehow, if a response contains it 2+ times we have found another number. We also reauthenticate as needed and note if we start to slow down the server at all. Yes, there are a million ways to make this concurrent and faster, but we’re trying to enumerate not DDOS their server, and at ~1.5 seconds average RTT we should be able to test every American phone number in about a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The log file starts to fill up with entries within a few minutes:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Time to go do something else for a while. Just over 27 hours and one ill-fated attempt at early season ski touring later, the script has finished happily, the logfile is full of entries, and no request has failed or taken longer than 3 seconds. So much for rate limiting. We’ve leaked every Freedom Chat user’s phone number, and unless they happened to leave the default channel, we’ve also matched their phone number to their PIN, rendering the entire PIN feature pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;2025-12-05: Freedom Chat responds clarifying that PINs don’t allow restoring past messages, only logging into the account, and that they “had already been implementing additional audit procedures following the Vienna exploit,” promises fixes by next week&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Let’s Encrypt is introducing several updates to the certificates we issue, including new root certificates, the deprecation of TLS client authentication, and shortening certificate lifetimes. To help roll out changes gradually, we’re making use of ACME profiles to allow users to have control over when some of these changes take place. For most users, no action is required.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let’s Encrypt has generated two new Root Certification Authorities (CAs) and six new Intermediate CAs, which we’re collectively calling the “Generation Y” hierarchy. These are cross-signed from our existing “Generation X” roots, X1 and X2, so will continue to work anywhere our current roots are trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most users get certificates from our default classic profile, unless they’ve opted into another profile. This profile will switch to the new Generation Y hierarchy on May 13 2026. These new intermediates do not contain the “TLS Client Authentication” Extended Key Usage due to an upcoming root program requirement. We have previously announced our plans to end TLS Client Authentication starting in February 2026, which will coincide with the switch to the Generation Y hierarchy. Users who encounter issues or need an extended period to switch can use our tlsclient profile until May 2026, which will also remain on our existing Generation X roots.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you’re requesting certificates from our tlsserver or shortlived profiles, you’ll begin to see certificates which come from the Generation Y hierarchy this week. This switch will also mark the opt-in general availability of short-lived certificates from Let’s Encrypt, including support for IP Addresses on certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also announced our timeline to comply with upcoming changes to the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, which will require us to shorten the length of time our certificates are valid for. Next year, you’ll be able to opt-in to 45 day certificates for early adopters and testing via the tlsserver profile. In 2027, we’ll lower the default certificate lifetime to 64 days, and then to 45 in 2028. For the full timeline and details, please see our post on decreasing certificate lifetimes to 45 days.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For most users, no action is required, but we recommend reviewing the linked blog posts announcing each of these changes for more details. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask here, on this forum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people put too much effort into everything they do. Here’s a good example from Kristijan around tension in his hands when touching and holding things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something clicked about inhibition and non-doing (in Alexander Technique), and the strongest effect has been a relaxation of my hands.&lt;/p&gt;— Kristijan (@kristijan_moves) August 20, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;Like I was touching and holding things with 40% more tension than required for that object or activity.@m_ashcroft any thoughts?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a great example, because gripping too tightly, as we might with the hands, is a great metaphor for what it’s like everywhere else in your system. There’s a pattern of pervasive over-gripping that, once you start to look for it, you will find everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an appropriate amount of energy required for each activity. Holding a cup, turning a steering wheel, or writing a blog post all need exactly the amount of energy that they need. This may sound like a truism, but if it were so obvious, why do many drivers often realise they are driving with a vice-like grip, with tension running up into their shoulders and jaws?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me share my slightly unusual definition of “effort”: it’s the felt experience of expending energy beyond what an activity requires, like tensing your brow when you try to understand something, or the excess tension in your hand when you hold your phone[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this definition, it’s clear that the appropriate amount of effort for any activity is zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea is where the concept of non-doing can trip people up, because it doesn’t mean no action. It means no effort, even though the amount of energy required could be large. Or, to borrow from Daoist wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished." — Lao Tzu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nature is an enormous flow of energy, yet nature makes no effort. Everything nature does is perfectly well-suited to what it does, and it cannot be otherwise. This is why non-doing comes with a felt experience of effortlessness, when it seems like everything is working exactly the way it’s supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this quote from Katie Ledecky who, with 14 Olympic medals, is described as “the most decorated female swimmer in history”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I felt so relaxed. It just felt very easy, and that's why it surprised me that I had broken my world record.” — Katie Ledecky&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but trying too hard can reduce performance. Here’s marathoner Ryan Hall:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“… you don't get your best performances by trying harder. When you see the guy who wins the race, he usually jogs out of it waving to the crowd, feeling good. The people who look the worst come in after the top guy.”[2] – Ryan Hall&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why is it so common to effort when it both feels harder and reduces performance?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one thing, there are all kinds of societal scripts in the modern age that push us in that direction. All those hustle bros captured by Total Work push their grindset worldview, recapitulating the Protestant work ethic for new audiences. The influence of these cultural waters on our psychophysical wiring can’t be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These scripts team up with one of the core principles of Alexander Technique: Faulty Sensory Appreciation. When you try so hard all the time, that level of effort feels familiar and you stop noticing it. Put another way, years of overdoing mis-calibrate your senses so effort feels right and ease feels wrong. If you follow your feelings, you are guided back to that same old familiar where you’re trying too hard without even realising it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, this phenomenon happens all the time in many other domains, and can be the cause of much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What all this means is that when you pull back the effort below your familiar baseline, it can feel unfamiliar, like you’re not trying hard enough, and those societal scripts I mentioned before can make this experience hard to stay in, even if you’re now closer to the appropriate amount of energy needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way out of this is to experiment with feeling the unfamiliarity of trying less hard and seeing what it’s like. In Kristijan’s case, he played with this for long enough that his sensory perception updated to reflect what was going on more accurately, and he was able to feel that he had been using too much tension before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I invite you to go about your day and practice dropping the effort. See how weird it feels, but notice how the activity is still getting done. See what it’s like to drop the energy too low, where you might become lethargic or your performance drops. Notice the sweet spot as a surprising experience of ease and a kind of elegance: the less you grip, the smoother and more precise the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy experimenting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you get hung up on this definition, just substitute it for something like “over-efforting” or “trying too hard”, as the underlying phenomenon is the same regardless of what you call it. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How a Kernel Bug Froze My Machine: Debugging an Async-profiler Deadlock&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been a Linux user since the late 90s, starting with Slackware on an underpowered AMD K6. Over the years I've hit plenty of bugs, but the last decade has been remarkably stable - until a kernel bug started freezing my machine whenever I used async-profiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not a kernel developer, but I found myself poking around kernel source code to understand the problem better and figure out what was going on under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was about to start an investigation of latency spikes in QuestDB reported by a user. To do that, I wanted to use the async-profiler to capture CPU heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, when I tried to attach the profiler, my machine froze completely. It did not respond to any keys, it was impossible to switch to a terminal, it did not respond to SSH. The only way to recover was to hard reboot it. I tried to start QuestDB with the profiler already configured to start at launch - the same result, a frozen machine almost immediately after the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought that was weird, this had not happened to me in years. It was already late in the evening, I felt tired anyway so I decided to call it a day. There was a tiny chance I was hallucinating and the problem would go away by itself overnight. A drowning man will clutch at a straw after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day, I tried to attach the profiler again - same result, frozen machine. Async-profiler integration in QuestDB is a relatively new feature, so I thought there might be a bug in the integration code, perhaps a regression in the recent QuestDB release. So I built an older QuestDB version: The same result, frozen machine. This was puzzling - I positively knew this worked before. How do I know? Because I worked on the integration code not too long ago, and I tested the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a strong hint that the problem was not in QuestDB, but rather in the environment. I've gotten lazy since my Slackware days and I have been using Ubuntu for years now and I realized that I had recently updated Ubuntu to the latest version: 25.10. Could it be that the problem is in the new Ubuntu version?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I started Googling around and I found a report created by a fellow performance aficionado, Francesco Nigro, describing exactly the same problem: machine freeze when using async-profiler. This was the final confirmation I was not hallucinating! Except Francesco is using Fedora, not Ubuntu. However, his Fedora uses the same kernel version as my Ubuntu: 6.17. I booted a machine with an older Ubuntu, started QuestDB and attached the profiler and it worked like a charm. This was yet another indication that the problem was in the system, possibly even in the kernel. This allowed me to narrow down my Google keywords and find this kernel patch which talks about the very same problem!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found it quite interesting: A kernel bug triggered by async-profiler causing machine freezes on recent mainstream distributions. After some poking I found a workaround: Start the profiler with &lt;code&gt;-e ctimer&lt;/code&gt; option to avoid using the problematic kernel feature. I tried the workaround and indeed, with this option, the profiler worked fine and my machine did not freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally I'd move on, but I was curious. What exactly is going on under the hood? Why is it freezing? What is this &lt;code&gt;ctimer&lt;/code&gt; thing? What exactly is the bug and how does the patch work? So I decided to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Async-profiler Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Async-profiler is a sampling profiler. It periodically interrupts threads in the profiled application and collects their stack traces. The collected stack traces are then aggregated and visualized in various ways (flame graphs are one of the most popular visualizations). It has multiple ways to interrupt the profiled application, the most common one is using &lt;code&gt;perf_events&lt;/code&gt; kernel feature. This is how it works by default on Linux
assuming kernel paranoia settings allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;perf_events Under the Hood&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;perf_events&lt;/code&gt; subsystem is a powerful Linux kernel feature for performance monitoring. For CPU profiling, async-profiler uses
a software event called &lt;code&gt;cpu-clock&lt;/code&gt;, which is driven by high-resolution timers (hrtimers) in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the sequence of events during profiling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup: For each thread in the profiled application, async-profiler opens a &lt;code&gt;perf_event&lt;/code&gt;file descriptor configured to generate a signal after a specified interval of CPU time (e.g., 10ms).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arming the event: The profiler calls &lt;code&gt;ioctl(fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH, 1)&lt;/code&gt;to arm the event for exactly one sample. This is a one-shot mechanism, combined with the&lt;code&gt;RESET&lt;/code&gt;at the end of the handler. The goal is to measure application CPU time only and exclude the signal's handler own overhead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Timer fires: When the configured CPU time elapses, the kernel's hrtimer fires and delivers a signal to the target thread.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Signal handler: Async-profiler's signal handler captures the stack trace and records the sample. At the end of the handler, it resets the counter and re-arms the event for the next sample:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;ioctl(fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_RESET, 0); // Clear the counterioctl(fd, PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH, 1); // Arm for exactly 1 more sample&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This cycle repeats for the duration of the profiling session, creating a stream of stack trace samples that are later aggregated into flame graphs or heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Kernel Bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel bug that caused my machine to freeze was introduced by commit 18dbcbfabfff ("perf: Fix the POLL_HUP delivery breakage"). Ironically, this commit was fixing a different bug, but it introduced a deadlock in the cpu-clock event handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what happens in the buggy kernel when the &lt;code&gt;PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH(1)&lt;/code&gt; counter reaches zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hrtimer fires for cpu-clock event - &lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_hrtimer()&lt;/code&gt;is called (inside hrtimer interrupt context)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_hrtimer()&lt;/code&gt;calls&lt;code&gt;__perf_event_overflow()&lt;/code&gt;- this processes the counter overflow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;__perf_event_overflow()&lt;/code&gt;decides to stop the event (counter reached 0 after&lt;code&gt;PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH(1)&lt;/code&gt;) - calls&lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_event_stop()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_event_stop()&lt;/code&gt;calls&lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer()&lt;/code&gt;- this calls&lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;to cancel the timer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DEADLOCK: &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;waits for the hrtimer callback to complete - but we ARE inside the hrtimer callback! The system hangs forever waiting for itself&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel()&lt;/code&gt; is a blocking call - it spins waiting for any active callback to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;int hrtimer_cancel(struct hrtimer *timer){int ret;do {ret = hrtimer_try_to_cancel(timer);if (ret &amp;lt; 0)hrtimer_cancel_wait_running(timer);} while (ret &amp;lt; 0);return ret;}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When called from inside that same callback, it waits forever. Since this happens in interrupt context with interrupts disabled on the CPU, that CPU becomes completely unresponsive. When this happens on multiple CPUs (which it does, since each thread has its own &lt;code&gt;perf_event&lt;/code&gt;), the entire system freezes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Click to see the deadlock visualized&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel patch fixes this deadlock with two changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;- hrtimer_cancel(&amp;amp;hwc-&amp;gt;hrtimer);+ hrtimer_try_to_cancel(&amp;amp;hwc-&amp;gt;hrtimer);&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel()&lt;/code&gt; is non-blocking - it returns immediately with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;if the timer was not active&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;if the timer was successfully cancelled&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;if the timer callback is currently running&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;, it doesn't spin waiting for the callback to finish. So when called from within the callback itself, it simply returns &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; and continues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;PERF_HES_STOPPED&lt;/code&gt;flag as a deferred stop signal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stop function now sets a flag:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static void cpu_clock_event_stop(struct perf_event *event, int flags){+ event-&amp;gt;hw.state = PERF_HES_STOPPED;perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer(event);...}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the hrtimer callback checks this flag:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static enum hrtimer_restart perf_swevent_hrtimer(struct hrtimer *hrtimer){- if (event-&amp;gt;state != PERF_EVENT_STATE_ACTIVE)+ if (event-&amp;gt;state != PERF_EVENT_STATE_ACTIVE ||+ event-&amp;gt;hw.state &amp;amp; PERF_HES_STOPPED)return HRTIMER_NORESTART;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How It Works Together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_event_stop()&lt;/code&gt; is called from within the hrtimer callback:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;PERF_HES_STOPPED&lt;/code&gt;flag is set&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;returns&lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;(callback running) - but doesn't block&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execution returns up the call stack back to &lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_hrtimer()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_hrtimer()&lt;/code&gt;completes and returns&lt;code&gt;HRTIMER_NORESTART&lt;/code&gt;(because&lt;code&gt;__perf_event_overflow()&lt;/code&gt;returned&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, indicating the event should stop)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The hrtimer subsystem sees &lt;code&gt;HRTIMER_NORESTART&lt;/code&gt;and doesn't reschedule the timer&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_event_stop()&lt;/code&gt; is called from outside the callback (normal case):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;PERF_HES_STOPPED&lt;/code&gt;flag is set&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;returns&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;- timer is cancelled immediately&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If by chance the callback fires before cancellation completes, it sees &lt;code&gt;PERF_HES_STOPPED&lt;/code&gt;and returns&lt;code&gt;HRTIMER_NORESTART&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PERF_HES_STOPPED&lt;/code&gt; flag acts as a safety net to make sure the timer stops regardless of the race between setting the flag and the timer firing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Debugging a kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explanation above is my understanding of the kernel bug and the fix based on reading the kernel source code. I am a hacker, I like to tinker. A theoretical understanding is one thing, but I wanted to see it in action. But how do you even debug a kernel? I'm not a kernel developer, but I decided to try. Here is how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My intuition was to use QEMU since it allows one to emulate or virtualize a full machine. QEMU also has a built-in GDB server that allows you to connect GDB to the emulated machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Setting up QEMU with Ubuntu&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I downloaded an Ubuntu 25.10 ISO image and created a new empty VM disk image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu-25.10.qcow2 20G&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I launched QEMU to install Ubuntu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ qemu-system-x86_64 \-enable-kvm \-m 4096 \-smp 4 \-drive file=ubuntu-25.10.qcow2,if=virtio \-cdrom ubuntu-25.10-desktop-amd64.iso \-boot d \-vga qxl&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second command boots the VM from the ISO image and allows me to install Ubuntu on the VM disk image. I went through the installation process as usual. I probably could have used a server edition or a prebuilt image, but at this point I was already in unknown territory, so I wanted to make other things as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the installation was complete, I rebooted the VM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ qemu-system-x86_64 \-enable-kvm \-m 4096 \-smp 4 \-drive file=ubuntu-25.10.qcow2,if=virtio \-netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::9000-:9000 \-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \-monitor tcp:127.0.0.1:55555,server,nowait \-s&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and downloaded, unpacked and started QuestDB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ curl -L https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/download/9.2.2/questdb-9.2.2-rt-linux-x86-64.tar.gz -o questdb.tar.gz$ tar -xzvf questdb.tar.gz$ cd questdb-9.2.2-rt-linux-x86-64$ ./bin/questdb start&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was meant to validate that QuestDB works in the VM at all. Firefox was already installed in the Ubuntu desktop edition, so I just opened &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:9000&lt;/code&gt; in Firefox and verified QuestDB web console was up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step was to stop QuestDB and start it with a profiler attached:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ ./bin/questdb stop$ ./bin/questdb start -p&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I expected the virtual machine to freeze. However, it didn't. It was responsive as if nothing bad had happened. That was a bummer. I wanted to see the deadlock in action! I thought that perhaps QEMU is in a way shielding the virtual machine from the bug. But then I realized that the default Ubuntu uses paranoia settings that prevent &lt;code&gt;perf_events&lt;/code&gt; from working properly and async-profiler falls back to
using &lt;code&gt;ctimer&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;perf_events&lt;/code&gt; are restricted. The kernel bug specifically lives in the &lt;code&gt;perf_events&lt;/code&gt; hrtimer
code path, so we must force async-profiler to use that path to trigger the bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To fix this, I changed the paranoia settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this, I restarted QuestDB with the profiler again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ ./bin/questdb stop$ ./bin/questdb start -p&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this time, the virtual machine froze as expected! Success! I was able to reproduce the problem in QEMU!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attaching GDB to QEMU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I was able to reproduce the problem in QEMU, I wanted to attach GDB to the emulated machine to see the deadlock in action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start &lt;code&gt;GDB&lt;/code&gt; on the host machine and connect it to QEMU's built-in GDB server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ gdbGNU gdb (Ubuntu 16.3-1ubuntu2) 16.3[...](gdb) target remote :1234Remote debugging using :1234warning: No executable has been specified and target does not supportdetermining executable automatically.

()(gdb) thread apply all bt&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Side note: We just casually attached a debugger to a live kernel! How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see 4 threads corresponding to the 4 CPUs in the VM. The &lt;code&gt;bt&lt;/code&gt; command shows the stack traces of all threads, but there is not much useful information since we don't have the kernel symbols loaded in GDB.
Let's fix this. I am lazy again and take advantage of running exactly the same kernel version as the host machine so I can use the host's kernel image and symbol files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the host machine, we need to add repositories with debug symbols and install the debug symbols for the running kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;echo "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com questing main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.listecho "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com questing-updates main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.listecho "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com questing-proposed main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.listsudo apt install ubuntu-dbgsym-keyringsudo apt updatesudo apt install linux-image-$(uname -r)-dbgsym&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the debug symbols installed, I started GDB again and loaded the kernel image and symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ gdb /usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)GNU gdb (Ubuntu 16.3-1ubuntu2) 16.3[...]gdb) target remote :1234Remote debugging using :12340xffffffff9e9614d3 in ??

    &lt;p&gt;and symbols were still NOT resolved! I had to capitulate and ask a LLM for help. After a bit of brainstorming, we realized that the kernel is compiled with KASLR enabled, so the kernel is loaded at a random address at each boot. The simplest way to fix this is to disable KASLR, I could not care less about security in my test VM. To disable KASLR, I edited the GRUB configuration, added the &lt;code&gt;nokaslr&lt;/code&gt; parameter, updated GRUB and rebooted the VM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ vim /etc/default/grub# Add nokaslr to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT lineGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nokaslr"$ sudo update-grub$ sudo reboot&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I set the paranoia settings again, started QuestDB with the profiler and attached GDB again. This time, the symbols were resolved correctly!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ gdb /usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)GNU gdb (Ubuntu 16.3-1ubuntu2) 16.3[...](gdb) target remote :1234[...](gdb) info threadsId Target Id Frame* 1 Thread 1.1 (CPU#0 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3a460) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:3512 Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3b520) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:3513 Thread 1.3 (CPU#2 [running]) hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343d028) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:13594 Thread 1.4 (CPU#3 [running]) hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks much better! We can see that the first 2 threads are stuck in &lt;code&gt;csd_lock_wait()&lt;/code&gt; function, presumably waiting for locks held by the other CPUs
and threads 3 and 4 are in &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The threads 3 and 4 are the interesting ones since they execute a function related to the kernel bug we are investigating. Let's switch to thread 4 and see its stack trace:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We can see the exact sequence of function calls leading to the deadlock: &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel()&lt;/code&gt; called from &lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_event_stop()&lt;/code&gt;, called from &lt;code&gt;__perf_event_overflow()&lt;/code&gt;, called from &lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_hrtimer()&lt;/code&gt;.
This matches our understanding of the bug perfectly! This is the infinite loop in &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel()&lt;/code&gt; that causes the
deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Forensics and Playing God&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, I have to admit that seeing a kernel stack trace is already somewhat satisfying, but we have a live (well, half-dead) kernel under a debugger. Let's have some fun. I want to touch the deadlock and understand why it took down the whole machine, and see if we can perform a miracle and bring it back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Confirming the suspect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel&lt;/code&gt; is waiting for a callback to finish. But which callback? The stack trace says &lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer&lt;/code&gt;,
but let's verify the hrtimer struct in memory actually points to the function we blame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I switched to the stuck thread (Thread 4 in my case) and looked at frame #0:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) thread 4[Switching to thread 4 (Thread 1.4)]#0 hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:13591359 in /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c(gdb) frame 0#0 hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:13591359 in /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c(gdb) print *timer$1 = {node = {node = {__rb_parent_color = 18446612682661667048, rb_right = 0x0, rb_left = 0x0}, expires = 48514879474}, _softexpires = 48514879474, function = 0xffffffff81716dd0 &amp;lt;perf_swevent_hrtimer&amp;gt;, base = 0xffff88813bda1440, state = 0 '\000', is_rel = 0 '\000', is_soft = 0 '\000', is_hard = 1 '\001'}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me explain these GDB commands: &lt;code&gt;frame 0&lt;/code&gt; selects the innermost stack frame - the function currently executing.
In a backtrace, frame 0 is the current function, frame 1 is its caller, frame 2 is the caller's caller, and so on.
By selecting frame 0, I can inspect local variables and parameters in &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;print *timer&lt;/code&gt; command dereferences the &lt;code&gt;timer&lt;/code&gt; pointer and displays the contents of the &lt;code&gt;struct hrtimer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;struct hrtimer {struct timerqueue_node node;ktime_t _softexpires;enum hrtimer_restart (*function)(struct hrtimer *);struct hrtimer_clock_base *base;u8 state;u8 is_rel;u8 is_soft;u8 is_hard;};&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key field here is &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; - a pointer to a callback function that takes a &lt;code&gt;struct hrtimer *&lt;/code&gt; and returns
&lt;code&gt;enum hrtimer_restart&lt;/code&gt;. This callback is invoked when the timer fires. GDB shows it points to &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff81716dd0&lt;/code&gt; and helpfully resolves this address to &lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_hrtimer&lt;/code&gt;. Since we're currently inside &lt;code&gt;perf_swevent_hrtimer&lt;/code&gt; (look at frame #6 in our backtrace above), this confirms the self-deadlock: the timer is trying to cancel itself while its own callback is still running!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Mystery of the "Other" CPUs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One question remained: If CPUs 3 and 4 are deadlocked in a loop, why did the entire machine freeze? Why couldn't I just SSH in and kill the process? The answer lies in those other threads we saw earlier, stuck in &lt;code&gt;csd_lock_wait&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) thread 1[Switching to thread 1 (Thread 1.1)]#0 csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3a460) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351warning: 351 /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c: No such file or directory&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CSD&lt;/code&gt; stands for Call Function Single Data. In Linux, when one CPU wants another CPU to do something (like flush a TLB
or stop a perf_event), it sends an IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt).
If the target CPU is busy with interrupts disabled (which is exactly the case for our deadlocked CPUs 3 and 4), it never responds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sender (CPU 0) sits there spinning, waiting for the other CPU to say "Done!". Eventually, all CPUs end up waiting for the stuck CPUs and the entire system grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Performing a Kernel Resurrection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the part where the real black magic starts. We know the kernel is stuck in this loop in &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_cancel&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;do {ret = hrtimer_try_to_cancel(timer);} while (ret &amp;lt; 0);&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As long as &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; (which it does, because the callback is running), the loop continues
forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we have GDB. We can change reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we force the function to return &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (meaning "timer not active"), the loop should break, &lt;code&gt;cpu_clock_event_stop&lt;/code&gt;
should finish, and the kernel should unfreeze. It might crash 1 millisecond later because we left the timer in an
inconsistent state, but perhaps it's worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's double-check we are in the innermost frame, inside &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) thread 4[Switching to thread 4 (Thread 1.4)]#0 hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359warning: 1359 /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c: No such file or directory(gdb) frame 0#0 hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343a0e8) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:13591359 in /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the GDB &lt;code&gt;finish&lt;/code&gt; command to let the function run to completion and pause right when it returns to the caller:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) finish&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are now sitting at line 1490, right at the check &lt;code&gt;if (ret &amp;lt; 0)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;int hrtimer_cancel(struct hrtimer *timer){int ret;do {ret = hrtimer_try_to_cancel(timer);if (ret &amp;lt; 0) // &amp;lt;-- we are herehrtimer_cancel_wait_running(timer);} while (ret &amp;lt; 0);return ret;}&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On x86_64, integer return values are passed in the &lt;code&gt;%rax&lt;/code&gt; register.
Since &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (32-bit), we can use &lt;code&gt;$eax&lt;/code&gt; (the lower 32 bits of &lt;code&gt;%rax&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) print $eax$2 = -1&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly as expected. &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; means the timer callback is running, so the loop will continue.
But since the CPU is paused, we can overwrite this value. We can lie to the kernel and tell it the timer was
successfully cancelled (return code 1) or inactive (return code 0). I chose 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) set $eax = 0(gdb) print $eax$3 = 0&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I crossed my fingers and unpaused the VM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) continueContinuing.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it did nothing. The VM was still frozen. Let's see what is going on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) info threadsId Target Id Frame1 Thread 1.1 (CPU#0 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3a460) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:3512 Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3b520) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:3513 Thread 1.3 (CPU#2 [running]) hrtimer_try_to_cancel (timer=0xffff88802343d028) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1359* 4 Thread 1.4 (CPU#3 [running]) csd_lock_wait (csd=0xffff88813bd3b560) at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/kernel/smp.c:351&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, thread 4 is also stuck in &lt;code&gt;csd_lock_wait&lt;/code&gt;, just like threads 1 and 2. We managed to escape from the infinite
loop in thread 4, but thread 3 is still stuck in &lt;code&gt;hrtimer_try_to_cancel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could try the same trick on thread 3, but would this be enough to unfreeze the entire system? For starters, we tricked the kernel into thinking the timer was inactive, but in reality it is still active. This is very thin ice to skate on - we might have just created more problems for ourselves. And more importantly, even if the kernel could escape the deadlock, the profiler would immediately try to re-arm the timer again, leading us back into the same deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I decided to give up on the resurrection attempt. The kernel was stuck, but at least I understood the problem now and I was pretty happy with my newly acquired kernel debugging skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I couldn't perform a miracle and resurrect the frozen kernel, I walked away with a much deeper understanding of the machinery behind Linux &lt;code&gt;perf_events&lt;/code&gt; and hrtimers. I learned how to set up QEMU for kernel debugging, how to attach GDB to a live kernel, and how to inspect kernel data structures in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For QuestDB users, the takeaway is simple: if you are on a kernel version 6.17, use the &lt;code&gt;-e ctimer&lt;/code&gt; flag when
profiling. It bypasses the buggy &lt;code&gt;perf_events&lt;/code&gt; hrtimer path entirely. Or just wait for either the kernel fix to land
in your distro or the next QuestDB release, which will include an
async-profiler version that works around this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for me, I’m going back to my code. The next time my machine freezes, I might just reboot it like a normal person. But where is the fun in that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Addendum: The Second Resurrection Attempt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After writing this post, I kept thinking about that failed resurrection attempt. We got so close: We broke one CPU out of the deadlock, but the other was still stuck. I should have tried harder! So I started QEMU again, reproduced the deadlock, and this time came with a plan: use GDB to force kernel to kill the QuestDB Java process, so the profiler can't re-arm the timer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I needed to find the Java process. The &lt;code&gt;perf_event&lt;/code&gt; structure has an owner field pointing to the task that created it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) print event-&amp;gt;owner$1 = (struct task_struct *) 0xffff88810b2ed100(gdb) print ((struct task_struct *)0xffff88810b2ed100)-&amp;gt;comm$2 = "java"(gdb) print ((struct task_struct *)0xffff88810b2ed100)-&amp;gt;pid$3 = 4488&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, we found the Java process with PID 4488. Now, how do you kill a process when the kernel is deadlocked and can't process signals? You store the signal directly in memory. &lt;code&gt;SIGKILL&lt;/code&gt; is signal 9, which means bit 8 in the signal bitmask:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) set ((struct task_struct *)0xffff88810b2ed100)-&amp;gt;signal-&amp;gt;shared_pending.signal.sig[0] = 0x100&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the pending kill signal in place, I broke the deadlock loop as before. The system hit another deadlock - a different CPU was now stuck waiting for a spinlock. The lock value showed it was held:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) print *((unsigned int *)0xffff88813bda1400)$4 = 1&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I forcibly released the lock (what could possibly go wrong?):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) set *((unsigned int *)0xffff88813bda1400) = 0&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then broke another &lt;code&gt;hrtimer&lt;/code&gt; loop on a different CPU. It was like playing whack-a-mole with deadlocks - each Java thread had its own &lt;code&gt;perf_event&lt;/code&gt;, and they were all hitting the same bug.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of this, I ran continue and checked the threads:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(gdb) continueContinuing.^CThread 4 received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82(gdb) info threadsId Target Id Frame1 Thread 1.1 (CPU#0 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:822 Thread 1.2 (CPU#1 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:823 Thread 1.3 (CPU#2 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82* 4 Thread 1.4 (CPU#3 [halted ]) 0xffffffff82621d8b in pv_native_safe_halt () at /build/linux-8YMEfB/linux-6.17.0/arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c:82(gdb) continue&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at the QEMU window. The desktop was responsive. The mouse moved. Java was gone - killed by the &lt;code&gt;SIGKILL&lt;/code&gt; we planted before breaking the deadlock.
We actually did it. We resurrected a kernel-deadlocked machine by lying to it about return values, forcibly releasing locks, and planting signals in process memory.
Would I recommend this in production (or anywhere outside a lab)? Absolutely not. But was it fun? Totally!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years I treated HDMI-CEC like a house spirit: sometimes helpful, mostly temperamental, never fully understood. My living-room stack is straightforward: Samsung TV on ARC (NOT eARC - story for another day), Denon AVR-X1700H hidden in a closet, Apple TV plus a bunch of consoles connected to the receiver, and a Raspberry Pi 4 already doing Homebridge duty. When it comes to CEC, the Apple TV handles it like a dream, but every console behaves like it missed the last week of CEC school. They wake the TV, switch the input, then leave the Denon asleep so I’m back to toggling audio outputs manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I documented the media closet build-out separately, so if you want the full wiring tour (and the before/after photos), start there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the media closet, rewiring everything to the TV wasn’t an option and disabling CEC wasn’t viable (Apple TV works and it gets the most use). My first instinct was to lean on traditional automation stacks: HomeKit scenes to chain “TV on” into “receiver on” or wattage triggers via an Eve Energy plug. This kind of worked, but every extra layer added 30 seconds of lag or more. The last stop on that journey was a &lt;code&gt;homebridge-cec-tv-control&lt;/code&gt; plugin, but while reading the README I realized I was about to pipe CEC messages through Node, Homebridge, and HomeKit before they hit the receiver. The Pi is wired into the rack already, so skipping those layers and going through &lt;code&gt;/dev/cec0&lt;/code&gt; directly was clearly the faster path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After an evening of struggling, the Pi now sits quietly on the HDMI bus, watching for consoles to announce themselves and issuing the single command Samsung + Denon should have exchanged on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post follows the structure of my notes: build a small mental model of CEC, monitor the bus, copy whatever Apple TV does right, wrap it in Python, then ship it as a systemd unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Small HDMI-CEC primer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-Definition Multimedia Interface Consumer Electronics Control, much better known as HDMI-CEC, is a low-bandwidth side channel that rides alongside HDMI video/audio. Everyone on the bus speaks in logical addresses (&lt;code&gt;0x0&lt;/code&gt; for TV, &lt;code&gt;0x5&lt;/code&gt; for audio systems, &lt;code&gt;0x4/0x8/0xB&lt;/code&gt;1 for playback devices, etc.) and tiny opcodes2 such as &lt;code&gt;0x82&lt;/code&gt; (Active Source) or &lt;code&gt;0x72&lt;/code&gt; (Set System Audio Mode). Physical addresses are “lat/long” references inside the topology, so &lt;code&gt;3.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; can mean “AVR input source HDMI 3”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CEC is supposed to help consumers control their electronics, so in a healthy system the flow goes like this: console wakes and declares itself active, the TV notices there’s an ARC partner, somebody sends “please be the audio system”, the receiver wakes up, and audio comes out of the big speakers. For me, that path only occurred when Apple TV was involved. Sadly, when I woke a console, the TV switched inputs but audio stayed on the tinny TV speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To debug that mess I first wrote down how every device identified itself on the bus. Here are the specific CEC roles in my home theater:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TV – logical address &lt;code&gt;0x0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audio system (Denon AVR-X1700H) – logical address &lt;code&gt;0x5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Playback devices – logical addresses &lt;code&gt;0x4&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;0x8&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;0xB&lt;/code&gt;(Apple TV, PS5, Switch 2 and Xbox all competing for the three playback slots3)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Broadcast – logical address &lt;code&gt;0xF&lt;/code&gt;(messages to everyone)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the key opcodes we ended up caring about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x82&lt;/code&gt;– Active Source (“I am now the active input”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x84&lt;/code&gt;– Report Physical Address (“this is where I live in the HDMI tree”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x70&lt;/code&gt;– System Audio Mode Request&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x72&lt;/code&gt;– Set System Audio Mode (Denon’s “I am now the audio system” broadcast)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Monitoring the CEC bus with &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 4 I have exposes &lt;code&gt;/dev/cec0&lt;/code&gt; interface on its micro-HDMI, and with a $7 micro-HDMI to HDMI cable plugged into HDMI input port on the receiver, it’s possible to monitor CEC traffic from everything connected to the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was initially hesitant because of some Hue Play Sync Box4 trauma: every HDMI splitter or inline gadget I’ve tried in front of the TV caused weird EDID breakage, troubles with HDR negotiation, or outright signal loss. But once I understood the Pi never sits in the middle of the HDMI handshake my concerns went away. By plugging it into an unused HDMI input on the AVR, it behaves like just another participant on the shared CEC bus. No signal regeneration, no spoofed EDIDs, nothing for the rest of the chain to notice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the topology looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now, you can get &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;libcec&lt;/code&gt;. Install it with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo apt update
sudo apt install cec-utils
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then do a quick scan to see which devices respond:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo "scan" | cec-client -s
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example scan output from my setup below. As you can see, the Xbox and Switch both3 claim logical address &lt;code&gt;0x8&lt;/code&gt;1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CEC bus information

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the expected devices show up, use monitor mode with the correct level5 of logging:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cec-client -m -d 8
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This command keeps the Pi quiet (monitor mode) yet gives you every bus transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A line such as &lt;code&gt;TRAFFIC: [...] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; bf:82:36:00&lt;/code&gt; means: logical &lt;code&gt;0xB&lt;/code&gt; (PS5) broadcast Active Source (&lt;code&gt;0x82&lt;/code&gt;) with physical address &lt;code&gt;3.6.0.0&lt;/code&gt;. That’s the packet you expect any console to send when it wakes up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Figuring out the magic handshake&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I put the system in standby, start logging, then wake Apple TV. I got the expected &lt;code&gt;Active Source&lt;/code&gt; burst, followed immediately by the Denon broadcasting that it has taken over audio:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8f:82:32:00       # Apple TV (logical 8) -&amp;gt; Broadcast: Active Source
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8f:a6:06:10:56:10 # Apple TV (logical 8) -&amp;gt; Broadcast: ???
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5f:72:01          # Denon (logical 5) -&amp;gt; Broadcast: Set System Audio Mode (on)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Translated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple TV announces itself as the active source.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple TV broadcasts some magic bits?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Very soon after, the Denon tells everyone “System Audio Mode is on,” and the TV happily keeps output set to Receiver instead of flipping back to TV speakers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did the exact same experiment with PS5, Xbox, Switch 2 and the result was different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bf:82:36:00       # PS5: Active Source
# ...a bunch of reports, but no 5f:72:01
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what was the &lt;code&gt;8f:a6:06:10:56:10&lt;/code&gt; frame when Apple TV was involved? With debug logs, &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt; showed &lt;code&gt;UNKNOWN (A6)&lt;/code&gt;. I suspect &lt;code&gt;libCEC&lt;/code&gt; labels it unknown because it’s in the vendor-specific range. The following bytes (&lt;code&gt;06:10:56:10&lt;/code&gt;) could be Apple’s proprietary payload, like some capability or extended control. It’s possible Samsung and Apple have a private handshake here that ultimately results in the Denon doing the right thing. It’s neat, but I couldn’t rely on it since it’s undocumented and sending it manually from the Raspberry Pi’s logical address had no effect. Impersonating Apple TV over CEC is not realistically viable and likely brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, with cec-o-matic.com, it was easy to craft a CEC frame for the Raspberry Pi to send a normal system audio mode request:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;15:70:00:00 # TV (1) -&amp;gt; Audio (5): System Audio Mode Request
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breaking it down:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt;= source&lt;code&gt;0x1&lt;/code&gt;(Recorder 1 = Pi) sends to destination&lt;code&gt;0x5&lt;/code&gt;(Audio System = Denon)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;70&lt;/code&gt;= opcode System Audio Mode Request&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;00:00&lt;/code&gt;= operands (TV’s physical address 0.0.0.0, plus “system audio status” = off/0, which Denon interprets as “please negotiate system audio mode and turn on ARC”)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second I typed this into &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;’s interactive shell with &lt;code&gt;tx 15:70:00:00&lt;/code&gt;, the Denon turned on and ARC anchored to the receiver even with only a console and TV powered on. I confirmed by checking the TV’s audio output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the solution started to emerge: whenever a console wakes up and claims Active Source, the Pi should step in and send &lt;code&gt;15:70:00:00&lt;/code&gt; to the Denon to kickstart audio negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t spam the bus!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know the basis of the automation, the most obvious thing to do is to write a bash script that loops &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt; every few seconds and blast &lt;code&gt;on 5&lt;/code&gt;. That sort of works, but it’s not ideal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using a loop means the automation is delayed instead of reacting to actual CEC events.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every iteration spins up a new &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;, binds to&lt;code&gt;/dev/cec0&lt;/code&gt;, sends one command, and tears down.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CEC is a shared bus, not a write-only GPIO.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A better pattern is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start a single long-lived &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;process.6&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Let it print every &lt;code&gt;TRAFFIC&lt;/code&gt;line for you to parse.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feed it &lt;code&gt;tx ...&lt;/code&gt;commands on stdin only when you need to intervene.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only catch: monitor mode (&lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt;) can’t transmit. So for the automation we switch to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cec-client -d 8
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; here. &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt; still prints all the traffic, but now it also accepts commands. Our Python script treats it like a bridge between HDMI land and our own logic: &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; is an event stream, &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; is a control channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Python script&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took some trial and error, but it wasn’t too difficult to write a small Python program that watches for consoles waking up and sends the magic &lt;code&gt;15:70:00:00&lt;/code&gt; command when needed. I put it all on GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The script logic goes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starts &lt;code&gt;cec-client -d 8&lt;/code&gt;as a subprocess.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses &lt;code&gt;TRAFFIC&lt;/code&gt;lines.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Watches for Active Source (&lt;code&gt;0x82&lt;/code&gt;) from any Playback logical address (&lt;code&gt;0x4/0x8/0xB&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tracks when the Denon last broadcast Set System Audio Mode (&lt;code&gt;5f:72:01&lt;/code&gt;) so we don’t fight Apple TV or the TV’s own logic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sends &lt;code&gt;tx 15:70:00:00&lt;/code&gt;at most once per console wake if nobody else has done it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The script doesn’t hard-code any device names, vendors, or physical addresses.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It treats any Playback logical address (&lt;code&gt;0x4/0x8/0xB&lt;/code&gt;) turning into Active Source as a “console wake” event.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It stays passive when Apple TV / Samsung / Denon manage to do the right thing themselves (because we observe a real &lt;code&gt;5f:72:01&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It runs as a single long-lived process tied to a single &lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;instance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make sure it starts on boot and keeps running, I wrapped it in a simple &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; service. The unit file I used can be found in the GitHub README. I’ve been running it for a few days and feels rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Generalizing this approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this post gives you enough of a mental model to adapt this approach to your own CEC pain points. My solution is specific to the Denon + Samsung + consoles scenario, but the same pattern should work for other CEC quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe your issue isn’t consoles not engaging the AVR. Maybe DTS never negotiates, or your TV keeps snapping back to its tiny speakers. The workflow is the same:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Get the Pi onto the an HDMI port. Plug the Pi into the TV or Receiver’s HDMI input using a micro-HDMI–&amp;gt;HDMI cable (or adapter). Put it somewhere it can sit forever.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Baseline the bus. Run:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;echo "scan" | cec-client -s -d 1&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;to make sure your Pi can see all the expected devices, what logical/physical addresses they have, and what roles they use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Record a “good” scenario and a “bad” one. Use:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;cec-client -m -d 8&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;to log traffic while you:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Trigger a good path (e.g., Apple TV gets 5.1 sound correctly).&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Trigger a bad path (e.g., DTS falls back to stereo, or ARC drops to TV speakers).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diff the traces. Look for opcodes that show up in the good trace but are missing in the bad. In my case, the interesting delta was the presence of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;5f:72:01&lt;/code&gt;after Apple TV woke, and the absence of anything like it when a console woke alone.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inject the missing opcode manually. Go to cec-o-matic.com to build the missing frame7, then run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cec-client -d 8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;in interactive mode, then type&lt;code&gt;tx ...&lt;/code&gt;for your suspected magic packet, and see if anything changes. If not, try again with a different frame.&lt;p&gt;You likely would want to start with a frame like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1f:...&lt;/code&gt;(Pi logical address as Recording 1&lt;code&gt;0x1&lt;/code&gt;to Broadcast&lt;code&gt;0xF&lt;/code&gt;), or&lt;code&gt;15...&lt;/code&gt;(Pi to Audio System&lt;code&gt;0x5&lt;/code&gt;), depending on what you’re trying to achieve.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wrap it in code. Once you know the magic packet, wrap it in a tiny program like the one above and let the Pi quietly participate on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can picture the good vs bad paths like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sequenceDiagram
  participant Src as Source (console/player)
  participant TV as TV (0)
  participant AVR as AVR / Soundbar (5)

  rect rgb(230,255,230)
    note over Src,AVR: Good path
    Src-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TV: Active Source (0x82)
    TV-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;AVR: System Audio Mode Request (0x70)
    AVR-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TV: Set System Audio Mode On (0x72)
  end

  rect rgb(255,230,230)
    note over Src,AVR: Bad path
    Src-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;TV: Active Source (0x82)
        note over TV,AVR: No audio-mode negotiation
  end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your job is to spot the missing step and teach the Pi to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where this leaves my setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple TV keeps doing its thing. PS5, Xbox, or Switch now wake the TV, the Pi nudges the Denon within half a second, and audio stays glued to the receiver. Latency is low enough that it feels native. The Pi sits in the closet pretending to be a slightly overqualified remote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are still a couple of rough edges I haven’t tackled yet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a console goes to sleep, the TV sometimes “helpfully” switches to its antenna input. I don’t even have an antenna plugged in, so the net effect is a confusing “no signal” screen instead of falling back to Apple TV or a known-good input. That’s technically “correct” from the TV’s point of view (its own tuner is always a valid source), but wrong for how this setup is actually used.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My sunset TV automation can land on a dead input. I have a HomeKit automation that turns the TV on around sunset. Most of the time that means Apple TV wakes up with a nice aerial screensaver. But if the last input before power-off was a console, the TV wakes to that HDMI port and just shows “no signal”, which confuses other people in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These problems are similar, but require slightly different solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Console standby → TV becomes Active Source. When a console goes to sleep it tends to release the bus and the TV politely promotes its tuner. The helper could watch for that very specific frame pair (console Standby, TV Active Source) and, after a short grace period, switch the input to Apple TV.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sunset automation → no Active Source. In this case the TV powers on but nobody (not even the TV) claims Active Source, so it sits on the last HDMI port showing “no signal.” The helper needs to detect “TV on, Denon asleep, no Active Source within N ms,” then wake both Apple TV and the receiver and switch inputs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or maybe we could unify both by having a state machine that tracks “who was Active Source most recently” and automatically falls back to Apple TV whenever the bus goes quiet or the TV promotes itself. Either way, the Pi’s job is to make sure there’s always a sane outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would turn the Pi into a more general “HDMI shepherd”: not just keeping ARC pinned to the receiver when something is playing, but also steering the system back to a sane default when nothing is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s probably a small cottage industry of “two-page CEC scripts” waiting to be written. If you adapt this trick for some other HDMI-CEC horror story, send me the packet traces—I’m collecting folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEC logical addresses are usually written in hex, so&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;decimal =&lt;code&gt;0xB&lt;/code&gt;hex =&lt;code&gt;Playback 3&lt;/code&gt;. To make things even more confusing,&lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;uses hex for logical addresses but trims the&lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt;prefix. For this psot I include&lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt;prefixes for clarity. ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Super confusing, using https://www.cec-o-matic.com is really helpful. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, HDMI-CEC only defines only three playback logical addresses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x4&lt;/code&gt;(Playback 1),&lt;code&gt;0x8&lt;/code&gt;(Playback 2), and&lt;code&gt;0xB&lt;/code&gt;(Playback 3). That’s fine if you have one streaming box and a couple of consoles. I had four playback-class boxes (Apple TV, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox) connected to the Denon. According to HDMI-CEC, only three of them can ever be “real” playback devices at once, so when the fourth one wakes up the TV and AVR have to reshuffle logical addresses on the fly. In practice this looked unhinged: if the Switch was on, changing input to Xbox was impossible, I’d get a quick black screen and the input snaps back to Xbox. This is wild, but fortunately I only use one console at a time so it’s not a big deal. Probably not worth trying to fix. ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not the new 8K one, the old 4K version that I was trying to make work with my 4K120 setup. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt;flag is a bitmask of log levels (&lt;code&gt;ERROR=1&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;WARNING=2&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;NOTICE=4&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;TRAFFIC=8&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;DEBUG=16&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;ALL=31&lt;/code&gt;), which is why something like&lt;code&gt;-d 4&lt;/code&gt;might show nothing interesting; the truth is hiding in&lt;code&gt;libcec&lt;/code&gt;source code. So&lt;code&gt;-d 8&lt;/code&gt;means “traffic only.” I originally tried&lt;code&gt;-d 4&lt;/code&gt;(notice) and saw nothing when turning on Apple TV, which led to a small detour through&lt;code&gt;libcec&lt;/code&gt;’s source. This was surprisingly under-documented and many sources had misleading info about it. ↩︎&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are Python bindings for libCEC like python-cec, but they’re under-documented and I found it easier to just wrap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cec-client&lt;/code&gt;as a subprocess. ↩︎&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using AI tools also can work here: paste your good and bad traces into something like ChatGPT and ask it to spot the differences, and suggest what CEC frames might be missing. Use a reasoning model like GPT-5.1-Thinking to get better analysis. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ford is once again shifting its electric vehicle manufacturing plans, a response to a year that’s been tough for the powertrain technology that’s still making waves overseas but has seen domestic government support cut and customer enthusiasm weaken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of planning to make enough electric vehicles to account for 40 percent of global sales by 2030—as it pledged just four years ago—Ford says it will focus on a broader range of hybrids, extended-range electrics, and battery-electric models, which executives now say will account for 50 percent of sales by the end of the decade. The automaker will make hybrid versions of almost every vehicle in its lineup, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company will no longer make a large all-electric truck, Ford executives told reporters Monday, and will repurpose an electric vehicle plant in Tennessee to build gas-powered cars. The next generation of Ford’s all-electric F-150 Lighting will instead be an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV, a plug-in hybrid that uses an electric motor to power its wheels while a smaller gasoline engine recharges the battery. Ford says the tech, which automakers have touted in recent years as a middle-ground between battery-electric vehicles and gas-powered ones, will give its truck extended towing capacity and a range of over 700 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ford still plans to produce a midsize electric pickup truck with a target starting price of about $30,000, to be available in 2027. That will be the first of the “affordable” electric vehicle models it’s currently designing at a skunkworks studio in California, which are slated to use a “universal” platform architecture that will make the vehicles cheaper to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new plans leave Ford with a bunch of excess battery-making capacity, which the company says it will use by opening a whole new business: a battery energy-storage sideline. This new business will produce lower-cost and longer-living lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries for customers in the public utility or data center industries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ford is following the customer,” says Andrew Frick, the president of Ford Blue and Ford Model e, the automaker’s gas- and battery-powered vehicle businesses. US customer adoption of electric vehicles is not where the industry expected at decade’s start, he says. (Battery-electric vehicles currently make up about 7.5 percent of US new car sales.) Frick also cited changes in the regulatory environment, including the Trump administration's rollback of commercial and consumer tax incentives for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company has also canceled an all-electric commercial van planned for the European market. Instead, Ford will team up with Renault, in a partnership announced last week, to develop at least two small Ford-branded electric vehicles for Europe—a move that CEO Jim Farley called part of a “fight for our lives,” as US automakers try to compete with affordable EVs out of China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ford said Monday that it also plans to produce a new gas-powered commercial van for North America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

I live and breathe it. I'm lucky enough to brush the heavens with my own metal and code, and I want nothing more than a booming orbital space economy that creates the flywheel that makes space just another location we all work and visit. I love AI and I subscribe to maximum, unbounded scale. I want to make the biggest bets. I grew up half-afraid we'd never get another Apollo or Manhattan. I truly want the BigThing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all to say that the current discourse is increasingly bothering me due to the lack of rigor; people are using back-of-the-envelope math, doing a terrible job of it, and only confirming whatever conclusion they already want. Calculating radiation and the cost of goods is not difficult. Run the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we do the classic engineer thing and get nerd sniped by all the shiny technical problems, it's worth asking the only question that matters: why put compute in orbit at all? Why should a watt or a flop be more valuable 250 miles up than on the surface? What economic or strategic advantage justifies the effort required to run something as ordinary as matrix multiplication in low Earth orbit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That "why" is nearly missing from the public conversation. The "energy is cheaper, less regulations, infinite space" arguments just ring false compared to the mountains of challenges and brutal physics putting anything in space layers on. The discourse then skips straight to implementation, as if the business case is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Personal Positioning&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not here to dunk on anyone building real hardware. Space is hard, and shipping flight systems is a credibility filter. I'm annoyed at everyone else. The conversation is full of confident claims built on one cherry-picked fact and zero arithmetic. This is a multivariable physics problem with closed-form constraints. If you're not doing the math, you're not contributing, you're adding noise and hyping for a future we all want instead of doing the hard work to actually drive reality forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core Thesis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The target I care about is simple: can you make space-based, commodity compute cost-competitive with the cheapest terrestrial alternative? That's the whole claim. Not "space is big." Not "the sun is huge." Not "launch will be cheap." Can you deliver useful watts and reject the waste heat at a price that beats a boring Crusoe-style tilt-wall datacenter tied into a 200–500 MW substation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can't beat that, the rest is just vibes. GPUs are pretty darn happy living on the ground. They like cheap electrons, mature supply chains, and technicians who can swap a dead server in five minutes. Orbit doesn't get points for being cool. Orbit has to win on cost, or it has to admit it's doing something else entirely. If it's an existential humanity play, that's cool too, but it's a slightly different game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Analytical Lens&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here's what I did. I built a simple model that reduces the debate to one parameter: cost per watt of usable power for compute. The infographic below lets you change the assumptions directly. If you disagree with the inputs, great. Move the sliders. But at least we'll be arguing over numbers that map to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is deliberately boring. No secret sauce. Just publicly available numbers and first-principles physics: solar flux, cell efficiency, radiator performance, launch cost, hardware mass, and a terrestrial benchmark that represents the real alternative: a tilt-wall datacenter sitting on top of cheap power. The code is public, please go through everything. github.com/andrewmccalip/thoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Findings and Implications&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the headline result: it's not obviously stupid, and it's not a sure thing. It's actually more reasonable than my intuition thought! If you run the numbers honestly, the physics doesn't immediately kill it, but the economics are savage. It only gets within striking distance under aggressive assumptions, and the list of organizations positioned to even try that is basically one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That "basically one" point matters. This isn't about talent. It's about integration. If you have to buy launch, buy buses, buy power hardware, buy deployment, and pay margin at every interface, you never get there. The margin stack and the mass tax eat you alive. Vertical integration isn't a nice-to-have. It's the whole ballgame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Market and Incentives&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why I trend positive on SpaceX here. If anyone can brute force a new industrial stack into existence, it's the team that can reduce $/kg and get as humanly close to free launch as possible. And they need to, because the economics are not close. This is not a 25% mismatch. It's 400%. Closing that is the whole job. Positive does not mean gullible. It needs measurable targets and painful reality checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If SpaceX ever goes public, this is exactly the kind of thing shareholders should demand: extreme, barely-achievable goalposts with clean measurement. Tesla did it with the options grant. Do the same here. Pay Elon a king's ransom if he delivers a new industrial primitive: cheap, sustained dollars per kilogram and dollars per watt in orbit, at real cadence, for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Broader Interpretation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;On strict near-term unit economics, this might still be a mediocre use of capital. A tilt-wall datacenter in Oregon with cheap power, cheap cooling, and technicians on call is hard to beat. Crusoe can park compute on stranded natural gas and turn it into flops with a supply chain that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the knock-on effects are why this keeps pulling at people. If you can industrialize power and operations in orbit at meaningful scale, you're not just running GPUs. You're building a new kind of infrastructure that makes it easier for humans to keep spreading out. Compute is just one of the first excuses to pay for the scaffolding. Even if this is a mediocre trade on strict near-term unit economics, the second-order effects could be enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll go one step further and say the quiet part out loud: we should be actively goading more billionaires into spending on irrational, high-variance projects that might actually advance civilization. I feel genuine secondhand embarrassment watching people torch their fortunes on yachts and status cosplay. No one cares about your Loro Piana. If you've built an empire, the best possible use of it is to burn its capital like a torch and light up a corner of the future. Fund the ugly middle. Pay for the iteration loops. Build the cathedrals. This is how we advance civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Links to Reports&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone is going to copy-paste this into the models, so I've done that part for you. It's a decent way to automate the sanity checks, but it could use more in-depth review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub: github.com/andrewmccalip/thoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Conduct a thorough, first-principles-based review of this project. Scrutinize every assumption and constant, rigorously fact-checking all data. The objective is to identify and correct any fundamental errors in logic or calculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grok: grok.com/share/...&lt;lb/&gt; ChatGPT: chatgpt.com/share/...&lt;lb/&gt; Gemini: gemini.google.com/share/...&lt;lb/&gt; Claude: claude.ai/public/artifacts/... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Overall Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, irrational ambition doesn't get to ignore physics. The point of this page is to make the constraints explicit, so we can argue about reality instead of vibes. If the numbers close, even barely, then it's worth running hard on the idea. If they don't, the honest move is to say so and move on. Either way, I think some version of this has a feeling of inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So scroll down, play with the sliders, and try to break it. Change launch cost. Change lifetime. Change specific power. Change hardware cost. The goal here isn't to "win" an argument. It's to drag the conversation back to first principles: assumptions you can point at, and outputs you can sanity-check. Check out the GitHub, run the code, find the errors, and I'll update it live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, we can do the fun part: thermal diagrams, radiator math, orbit beta angles, failure rates, comms geometry, all the shiny engineering details that make this topic so addicting. It's not obviously stupid, and it's not a sure thing. That's why it's worth doing the math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might not be rational. But it might be physically possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Technical Engineering Challenges&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governing constraint for orbital compute is thermodynamics. Terrestrial datacenters leverage convective cooling—dumping waste heat into the atmosphere or water sources, effectively using the planet as an infinite cold reservoir. In the vacuum of space, convection is impossible. Heat rejection relies exclusively on radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every object in space settles to an equilibrium temperature where absorbed power equals radiated power. If heat generation exceeds radiative capacity, the temperature rises until the $T^4$ term in the Stefan-Boltzmann law balances the equation:&lt;/p&gt;$$\dot{Q}_{\text{rad}} = \varepsilon \sigma A T^4$$&lt;p&gt;The engineering challenge is ensuring this equilibrium temperature remains below the safe operating limits of silicon processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Energy Balance and Heat Rejection&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To dimension the radiator surface, we must account for the total thermal load managed by the satellite bus. In this model, based on a Starlink-style bifacial architecture (PV on front, radiator on back), the system must reject the aggregate energy of two distinct paths:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Incident Solar Flux: The sun delivers $G_{\text{sc}} = 1361\;\text{W/m}^2$ (AM0). With a solar absorptivity $\alpha = 0.92$, the panel absorbs approximately $\sim 1250\;\text{W/m}^2$.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Energy Partitioning: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Electrical Path ($\sim$22%): High-efficiency cells convert $\sim 275\;\text{W/m}^2$ into electricity. This power drives the compute payload and is converted entirely back into heat by the processors. A liquid cooling loop collects this heat and returns it to the panel structure for rejection.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Thermal Absorption ($\sim$78%): The remaining $\sim 975\;\text{W/m}^2$ is not converted to electricity but is absorbed immediately as lattice heat (phonon generation) within the panel structure.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Total Heat Load: The radiator must reject the sum of both the immediate thermal absorption and the returned electrical waste heat—effectively 100% of the absorbed solar flux.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imposes a strict area density limit. High-power compute requires large collection areas, which inherently absorb large amounts of solar heat. The radiator must be sized to reject this aggregate load while maintaining an operating temperature below the junction limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Operating Temperature Limits&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern AI accelerators (H100/B200 class) typically throttle at junction temperatures $T_j &amp;gt; 85\text{–}100\degree\text{C}$. To maintain a junction at 85°C, and accounting for the thermal gradient across cold plates and interface materials ($\Delta T \approx 10\degree\text{C}$), the radiator surface temperature $T_{\text{rad}}$ is constrained to approximately 75°C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model below calculates the equilibrium temperature for a bifacial array in a terminator orbit ($\beta = 90^\circ$). It accounts for solar flux, Earth IR ($\sim 237\;\text{W/m}^2$), and albedo. If the calculated equilibrium temperature $T_{\text{eq}}$ exceeds the target radiator temperature, the design fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A JetBlue (JBLU.O) passenger jet bound for New York took evasive action on Friday to avoid a mid-air collision with a U.S. Air Force tanker plane near Venezuela, a pilot said in an air traffic control recording.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JetBlue Flight 1112 had departed the Caribbean nation of Curacao and was flying about 40 miles (64 km) off the coast of Venezuela when the Airbus (AIR.PA) A320 reported encountering the Air Force jet, which did not have its transponder activated, according to the recording captured by liveatc.net.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Air Force pilot was within a few miles of the plane and at the same altitude, the JetBlue pilot said on the recording.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"They passed directly in our flight path... They don't have their transponder turned on. It's outrageous," the pilot said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Air Force jet then entered Venezuelan airspace, the JetBlue pilot said. "We almost had a mid-air collision up here."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;INCIDENT RECALLS DEADLY JANUARY CRASH&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senate Commerce Committee Chair Ted Cruz noted on Monday that an Army helicopter had collided with an American Airlines (AAL.O) flight on January 29 near Reagan Washington National Airport, killing 67 people, and was not using an advanced tracking technology called an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system, also known as ADS-B. "Why do we continue to tolerate near misses?" Cruz said of the JetBlue incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the committee, also said the JetBlue incident raised concerns and the public needed a better system. "This is not acceptable," Cantwell said. "You don't have corridors where military aircraft and commercial planes are flying and then not letting each other know that they are in that space. We just can't have that."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The senators spoke on Monday at a press conference as they push to remove a provision from a must-pass annual defense bill that they say would weaken air safety by allowing military aircraft to operate in Washington, DC, airspace without transmitting ADS-B information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A JetBlue spokesperson said on Monday the company's top priority was safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our crew members are trained on proper procedures for various flight situations, and we appreciate our crew for promptly reporting this situation to our leadership team. We have reported this incident to federal authorities and will participate in any investigation."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;U.S. MILITARY ACTIVE IN REGION&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The incident happened as the United States has mounted a large-scale military buildup in the southern Caribbean as President Donald Trump campaigns to oust Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, pushing relations to their most volatile point in years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Southern Command said in a statement on Monday that it was aware of the incident and reviewing the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The military added its "aircrews are highly trained professionals who operate in accordance with established procedures and applicable airspace requirements. Safety remains a top priority, and we are working through the appropriate channels to assess the facts surrounding the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration warned major airlines of a "potentially hazardous situation" when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution. Major airlines from around the world have halted flights as tensions have worsened and Trump has threatened to begin hitting land targets in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FAA did not immediately comment on Monday on the JetBlue incident.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Native versus emulation - World of Warcraft game performance on Snapdragon X Elite&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I tested the Snapdragon X Elite unreleased dev-kit, and I couldn't really compare x86 versus native gaming performance for the same game. I only managed to get World of Warcraft Classic x86 to run, and when compared to the native version, the FPS drop was 40-60% in two simple benchmarks. WoW retail x86 did not work, but now with the latest Windows improvements and the Prism emulation layer, things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Test platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tests were done on a Snapdragon X Elite dev kit equipped with X1E-00-1DE Snapdragon X Elite SoC (3.8 GHz with 4.3 GHz boost on 1-2 cores) and 32GB of RAM. The dev kit runs at a higher TDP than most, if not all, laptops and has the theoretically best bin of chips (highest boost clocks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key difference since my initial review is the Windows version. Microsoft was working hard on improving emulation performance and compatibility. Since Windows 11 24H2, there is a new emulator called Prism, and with recent updates it also got AVX instructions support to handle even more x86_64 applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the tests I used Windows 11 25H2 26220.7344 Insider Preview version to get all possible improvements taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the x86_64 binaries properties were edited to enable &lt;quote&gt;newer emulated CPU features&lt;/quote&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WoW is an MMORPG, and it does not have a built-in benchmark. It can be reliably benchmarked to some extent if you use specific game areas/instances. You can check more in my WoW benchmarking section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a PC game, it's a modern DX12 game engine with optional ray-traced shadows support and a few other features. It offers native x86, Windows on ARM, and Apple Silicon versions. In my previous tests, the x86 retail version would not run on Snapdragon, and only the Classic version managed to run. The FPS drop versus the native version was massive of around 40-60% (but the testing wasn't as detailed as I would like).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Windows (and WoW) changes, both x86_64 WoW clients managed to run on Windows on ARM, allowing me to get way more test data. MSI Afterburner and other similar tools don't support WoA, so I had to use the game's built-in average FPS meter (which doesn't average over long periods of time; and no 1% lows/frame time graphs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;World of Warcraft - native versus emulated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I measured the FPS at 1080p for two settings - mode 3 (low) and mode 7 (high). The results are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are astounding as the x86 version is rivaling the native one, maybe even edging the native client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WoW Classic and Stonard in retail are old locations, very light to render, so even with an iGPU, the FPS will be high.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ardenweald is the most GPU-intensive modern zone from the test collection. Bastion is less demanding but has a bit more geometry. Dazar'alor harbor view is a geometry/render distance-based benchmark and will depend mostly on GPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Necrotic Wake and Spires of Ascension are dungeons with some mobs, geometry, and units the game tracks. GPU with increasing CPU load.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Valdrakken is a player hub from the previous expansion, now mostly empty - player hubs when active are quite demanding to render without stutter. They tend to use a lot of assets as well.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combat benchmark is pushing the game into single-core CPU limit - it's done in the old Karazhan raid, where I can reliably pull a large group of mobs and stand still with fixed camera position. iGPUs can also be the bottleneck on higher settings due to particle effects of spells going off. Most dGPUs will have no problems with them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Out of combat, when test mobs despawn, the FPS inside Karazan increases as it's an old instance without any complex geometry or large asset collection. The game combat &lt;quote&gt;world state&lt;/quote&gt;vanishes and thus the single-core bottleneck as well&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Karazhan benchmark was the only one where the native version was noticeably ahead of the emulated version. Due to that, I've also added two modern dungeon instances, and those results were more in line with other locations. Either there was a difference between game versions, or in larger instances, game performance can be limited by some sort of system latency, and emulation is not the best for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WoW by default will use 4 CPU cores, with one core being the &lt;quote&gt;primary&lt;/quote&gt; ones. In a mass combat / mass NPC scenario, the main core will see 100% load and will be the limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows on ARM can handle a lot of x86 Windows applications, but not all of them. From my quick re-tests, I managed to run Unigine Valley, but Unigine Superposition failed to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Default versus very strict emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was curious what the difference between emulation settings. Switching to &lt;quote&gt;very strict&lt;/quote&gt; emulation settings disables a lot of features, which in turn tanked x86 WoW performance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mobile SoC comparison&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also recently tested Strix Point HX 370, and Intel Arrow Lake 255H capped at 30W, so I've added them to the comparison charts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In iGPU-heavy scenarios, Intel/AMD tend to be ahead, while in CPU scenarios, all 3 platforms get close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really wanted to compare native versus emulated on Snapdragon, as initial WoW Classic performance differences were huge. With recent Prism updates, I forced the devkit to update Windows, and it managed to run the x86 retail World of Warcraft client. This allowed me to test CPU and GPU-focused scenarios within the game. Surprisingly, for WoW, there was no real penalty, at least outside the raid/combat scenario. When you install Battle.net and WoW, you will get the native version by default, so you don't have to select or change anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's good to see improvements to Windows on ARM. Better application compatibility is nice, but it will never be perfect. On top of that, some apps will have hardcoded checks, and you won't be able to use x86 drivers. Qualcomm is preparing the second generation of mobile X Elite chips, and it will be interesting to see how they perform. Initial launch saw a lot of laptop sales, but also a lot of returns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limited Linux support is still a problem, from device tree lists, firmware extraction, to overall worse behavior of the SoC under Linux. Linux ARM support is way better than Windows, and even some hardware vendors tend to support ARM Linux due to the Raspberry Pi (like astrophotography equipment, vision cameras).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Bob Dylan Concert for Just One Person&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;An interview with Fredrik Wikingsson, the subject of 'Experiment Ensam'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flagging Down the Double E’s is an email newsletter exploring Bob Dylan performances throughout history. Some installments are free, some are for paid subscribers only. Sign up here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eleven years ago today, a Finnish online gaming company posted a 14-minute video that blew the minds of Bob Dylan fans across the globe. It depicted one of the most unusual performances of Dylan’s career, which had occurred just a few weeks prior. On stage in a beautiful old theater, Bob and his band performed for exactly one person. You can see that person sitting there in the photo up top. The rest of the theater was entirely empty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did this happen, that Bob Dylan gave a concert for just one guy? And what was this experience like for that guy? I wanted to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That person was Fredrik Wikingsson, a prominent TV host in Sweden. The video was part of a series called Experiment Ensam, which translates to Experiment Alone. The idea was to explore what happened when a single person did an activity typically meant for a group: Karaoke, stand-up comedy, and, in this case, attending a Bob Dylan concert. Have you ever gotten annoyed at people around you at a Dylan concert and wished they weren’t there? For Wikingsson, they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but Dylan did not perform his usual fare. Instead, he performed four 1950s covers, several of which he’s never sung before or since: Buddy Holly’s “Heartbeat,” Fats Domino’s “Blueberry Hill,” Lefty Frizzell’s “You’re Too Late,” and Big Bill Broonzy’s “Key to the Highway.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I interviewed Wikingsson about his surreal experience having Dylan sing for only him. That’s below. On Monday, I’ll share a part two with the series’ director, who shares some behind-the-scenes info on how it came together, including an unexpected meeting with Bob himself. That one will go only to paid subscribers. Sign up if you want to read it [update: it’s here]:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, the Experiment Ensam Dylan segment is a fascinating video and I encourage you to watch it if you haven’t before. The audio is in Swedish, but it’s subtitled in English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start at the beginning and walk through it. And the beginning is: How did you become the one person?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a series of commercials made in Sweden for a Finnish online gaming site. The theme was, we have this famous Swedish semi-crappy singer, Vanilla Ice meets Snoop Dogg, who experienced things alone that you normally do in a group, collectively. So he went to a stand-up comedy club alone. He went to the opera alone. All those things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew the director a bit. I met him at a party, three a.m. in an apartment, everybody was drunk, and he came up to me. “Have you seen the things we did with Experiment Alone?” I lied to him and I said, “Yeah, sure, those are great.” I hadn’t really seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said, “Guess what we’re going to do next.” He knew that I’m like one of the biggest Dylan fans in Sweden. Maybe that’s a stretch, but one of the biggest he knew for sure. And he said, “It’s going to be Bob Dylan.” I just immediately—and you’ll have to excuse my French—I said, “Who do I have to blow for it to be me?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[I told him,] “You need to get rid of the other guy. The storytelling is much better if I do it because I’m a huge fan. I’ll be able to write articles about it. It’s going to be better for this fucking Finnish gaming site if I do it. I won’t take any money for it. I will pay for my own trip; I will pay for my own hotel. I just want the experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had to sit through meetings with a lot of commercial people—art directors, directors, all these PR people. All the while, there was a 50% part of me thinking, “This is just a Punk’d episode.” Because I work in television, so I would be a perfect target for that. Right up until the minute he walked in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you’re meeting all these people to get approved, basically?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, because they had to can the other guy, and they needed to be sure it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not much of a predator normally, but in this case, it was like, “That needs to be me. This is one of those things I potentially could remember forever,” which turned out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why was it in Philly? Was that just where Bob said he would do it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could imagine the PR people going, “Okay, what venues is he playing? What will look good on camera?” Because he was playing the same night in that venue, a beautiful old theater.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you ever get any intel on why he agreed to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He probably got a lot of money for it. There was a bit of speculation afterwards, like it was the best paid soundcheck in history. And in essence, it was like a soundcheck, because I guess he runs through numbers for fun sometimes at soundchecks. This time it was just with me in the audience and a couple of cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you get approved, once you know where it’s going to be, what are your expectations going in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, it was very complex, because I’ve read all these books about him, I’ve seen all the films, and I’m acutely aware of how uncomfortable he is in weird settings. It was like, “How much am I gonna feel that he hates this?” That was my biggest fear, that I’m going to sit there and be part of the thing that made Dylan’s day shittier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You think about, “What if I got in the same elevator as him?” Well, I wouldn’t say anything, because I don’t want to be a nuisance. That was like an elevated version of that—no pun intended. However much money he got paid, I don’t want to be that person who makes Dylan’s day worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I just read the other day the theory that he has the highest threshold for embarrassment in the world. That the key asset in Dylan’s career was the fact that he doesn’t get embarrassed. He can try things like playing religious songs, playing electric, he doesn’t care. So maybe there is a chance of that as well. Like he can do this stupid, silly thing in front of one person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So there was part of me going, “He doesn’t give a fuck,” and part of me going, “He hates this, he’s gonna think of me as a nuisance.” I don’t think I’ve ever been as self-aware, ever, walking into that theater and thinking about how he will receive this. But it faded away pretty quickly once the music got going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you know it was going to be covers? Were you expecting his own songs? Did you know how long it was going to be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected him to run through three, four numbers of the current set list. To me, it was the greatest delight, him playing songs he’d never really played before or since. That made it even more special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had he played “Lay Lady Lay” or whatever, a couple of the best-of, that would have been exciting as well. But this certainly—I mean, I didn’t even know half the songs. It made it way more special. That could potentially be released as an EP, because it was such a unique little foursome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I watched the film, you look, to me, fairly apprehensive walking into the theater beforehand. Is that how you would describe your feelings?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen the film. To me, it’s such a powerful memory. It’s such a peculiar sensation in my mind, almost like a taste or a smell. I don’t want to water it down with other influence. I just want to have that thing, how I feel about it, in my mind for as long as I can remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you remember about your emotions as he comes out, as he starts playing, as you realize it’s a Buddy Holly song?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always loved Buddy Holly, so, to me, that was just delightful. I had a double CD of Buddy Holly’s greatest hits when I was in my early teens, and I learned to play guitar playing his songs. So that was just like a bonus for me. And I knew how much Buddy Holly meant to him. I’ve read Chronicles many, many times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in all honesty, it wouldn’t have mattered almost what he played. Just the fact that he chose the songs and those were apparently songs he was keen on playing and trying out with the guys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, it was also moving just to see the band sounded so good. They really wanted to put on a good show. Of course, not only to me, they knew they were being recorded, but still, these guys are fucking pros. They don’t want to let him down or me down or the camera down. It felt like a bit of a collective effort. And I want to include myself in that collective if I can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of including yourself in the collective effort, one of the most striking moments was you debating the question of: Do you applaud? [He did at first, then said it sounded weird echoing around the room by itself, so he stopped.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is complicated. Everybody in the room knows how silly this is. But still, even though it was such a weird scenario, I wanted to be like a human in it, at least try to imitate one. That’s why also later on I shouted something like, “You guys sound great!” I wanted to include the band, for whatever it’s worth. I remember him smiling at me a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Were you feeling self-conscious? You’re fairly brightly lit. He can see you. You’re right there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course. Acutely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s not the guy who’s going to look at you intently, and I was quite a few meters away, but I was thinking about how I behaved, I was thinking about how it sounded, I was thinking about how I was feeling. I was trying to preserve it to myself and record it in my own mind. There were like fifteen things going on at the same time in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, it’s one of the most heightened experiences of my life. Being at a Dylan show is always exciting—I’ve been to maybe thirty—but this was something else. To no surprise, like four hours later I was super drunk in a karaoke bar in Philly, because it was too much to handle. I needed to just blow off some steam afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was watching it, I was thinking, if this were me, is this a dream, or is this more like a nightmare?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could have gone either way. If I’d had the sense that he really despised this whole thing, giving me the evil Dylan eye, which he has given a lot of people throughout the years—and I’ve seen all the clips—if the vibe had been antagonistic, that would have been terrible. But it just felt as joyous as one of those very manufactured scenarios probably can feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a moment where he looks around this empty room and chuckles to himself. Then at the end, he says, “You can come anytime” and he’s sort of laughing with the band. He seems to be getting a kick out of the ridiculous artifice of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That made my day and my week and my year. All the tension blew away. Like, okay, this was fine. He dug this, in his way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was probably from a true place, but it also felt a little bit generous. Okay, he realizes we’re—I’m not going to say we’re in this together, because that’s a reach, but it was a weird little thing and I was a small part of it. Even though it’s a bit of a stretch to call that a connection, it’s something. It’s fucking something. To me, the music, of course, and the whole experience, but also the fact that I made him laugh a little bit and say something—I’ll cherish that forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you have a favorite song, a favorite performance?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he played the harmonica. Up to that moment, if I’m generalizing a little bit, I always thought that I was sort of a word man, and the lyrics were the most important thing. And maybe I underestimated the whole music aspect. I mean, I’ve seen all the beautiful harmonica solos from the ’66 tour or the 1980 tour, “What Can I Do For You.” All those things are majestic and fucking amazing, but there was something about when he played the harmonica just for me. Because he could have easily just skipped the harmonica part. He could have just done the song. That felt like a little extra gift, musically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It may sound silly, but it made me feel maybe I’ve underestimated how much the music has meant to me throughout the years. It’s been a major part of my life since I was 15. He’s been with me for such a long time, and I just thought, “Okay, I need to pay closer attention to the music.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bob Dylan finishes, leaves the stage. What happens next?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a very sad coda to this story, I’m afraid. It’s tragic comedy. What’s the word in English?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tell me the story and I’ll let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people, when I went on this trip, asked, “Are you going to be able to have dinner with him? Are you going to have drinks with him?” I went, “No, no, no. That’s not him. That’s not the show. That’s not going to happen.” I had zero expectations of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But maybe he could sign an album for me. At least I could ask that. That’s not a big ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I’m in New York the day before and I’m like okay, I need to buy a couple of albums. I want to buy for one for me and one for one of my best friends who’s a huge Dylan fan. What a great gift to give a friend. And also a bit of busting balls, like a constant reminder to my friend that I got to experience this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m in some store on Bleeker Street, of course, and I’m thinking, “Okay, so what albums? Am I going to go the Blonde on Blonde way? Or am I going to be funny and do the Self-Portrait thing?” I start to overthink in a very moronic way. I’m thinking to myself, “Wait a minute, isn’t there a rumor that he has recorded an album of Sinatra covers?” Which turned out to be true later on. So I’m thinking, “I should buy two Sinatra albums.” I’m buying In the Wee Small Hours and I think Songs for Swingin’ Lovers. “That’s very cool. It shows Dylan that I’m in the know.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might ask yourself, didn’t you buy any backup albums? No, I did not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I go to Philly with my two Sinatra albums in hand. I meet [Dylan manager] Jeff Rosen afterwards. He’s over the moon because I’ve behaved. “Oh, that was great. You did well. Dylan is so happy with this. Thank you very much for not overreacting” or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I’m asking him, “Do you think he could sign a couple of albums for me?” “Of course! Bob would love to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I pull out the albums and he’s like, “But these are Sinatra albums…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It starts to dawn on me that this is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He says, “That would be like pissing on Sinatra’s grave. Bob would never do that. Did you bring any backup albums?” And I’m like, “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff Rosen is just walking away. “I’m sorry, man. I can’t help you.” And then, boom, it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m standing there thinking, I can’t let this define my experience. I need to put this out of my mind immediately, because this is not the experience. The experience just took place. That was the music, that was the concert. Fuck the albums, fuck the autographs, that doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve tried very bravely throughout the years to put that out of my mind, and I’ve succeeded. Just thinking about it now, it breaks my heart a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to have brought it back up. But yeah, tragicomedy is maybe the word.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I weirdly have a similar story. Elvis Costello used to have this TV show. I once won tickets to a private taping with Bruce Springsteen, shortly after college. I’m a big fan of both of them now, but at the time I was more of a Springsteen guy. So I was thinking, maybe in this smaller, more private setting, I’d be able to meet him. So I brought a Bruce album just in case. The show’s amazing, then afterwards, I go around back to this loading dock. I was just hanging out by the buses. No security or anything. Who shows up? Not Bruce. Elvis. I ask him, “Do you want to sign this?” He laughed like, “I’m going sign a Bruce album?” But he did. He seemed to find it funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, maybe Bob would have too, but I met the gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elvis is a little more personable. Or at least, in that case, easier to find without a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you seen the Bruce film?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just saw it a couple of weeks ago. It was okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you like A Complete Unknown?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I liked it more. I thought A Complete Unknown did the same thing better, which is sort of a Hollywood-ish, paint-by-numbers biopic. I mean, I’m Not There, that’s my Bob movie. That’s the movie for the weirdos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the screening of [A Complete Unknown], I thought to myself maybe ten times, “Oh, this is too silly. This is fucking hokey.” Then, also, my eyes welled up ten times as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s only movies that could do that. They can both be fucking silly and ludicrous and then very moving two minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m Not There is a much better film, but I thought to myself, “Did I cry once during that film?” Not really, but I was impressed with it. So to me, it was much more of an intellectual experience. Whereas a hokey biopic takes you to another place emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sort of agree with that. I was expecting to be like a Dylan nerd fact-checker getting annoyed at all the errors. And there were a million factual errors, but in the moment they didn’t annoy me. The overall emotional story seemed basically true, and I got swept up in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somebody asked Chalamet, “How do you feel about letting go of Dylan as a character?” “I feel terrible. I love being this guy.” And then somebody said, “You could just wait like ten, twelve years and then play him during the gospel period.” His eyes just lit up, like, “Oh, fuck yeah. That’s still on the table.” Which would be an incredible film, I think. That could be even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every ten years they could just make another one as the guy gets older and older.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then eventually they get to Philly and my concert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s like the 27th installment in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the least-seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read that you didn’t want to see the show that night. That it would have felt weird. So when did you next see a regular Bob Dylan concert?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He came to Stockholm in 2015, and he played a pretty small venue called the Waterfront Arena, which is where, later, he collected his Nobel Prize backstage. He played a lot of the Tempest songs. That was one of the best concerts I’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it didn’t color my experience in any way. This is such a stand-alone thing. It’s not like I sat there six months later and was like, “Hmm, how does this compare to seeing him alone?” It’s not comparable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You were able to just plug back into how you would see a Dylan concert before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah. Have you seen him lately?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This summer, the Outlaw tour here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw him just two weeks ago in a huge arena in Stockholm. I don’t know how to feel about the concerts anymore. I appreciate that he plays nine out of ten songs from the latest album. Who else does that at that age? And he puts his heart into it, but he’s done it many years now. I don’t even know if it’s a good experience anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe five years from now, I’ll listen to a tape and it’s going to sound great. Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re a decade and change on. How do you look back at the experience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weirdly, I think about it more now than I did in the years immediately afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was just like, “All right, I’ve had a busy life, a lot of work, family stuff—let’s pocket that beautiful thing for to reminisce about in the future.” But now I guess I’m in the future, and I’m reminiscing about it more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will occasionally, when I’m in the car listening to Dylan, bring it out as a little mental gemstone that I sit and polish in my mind. Almost like taste it and feel it. That sounds fucking ludicrous, but you know what I mean. I indulge myself, wallowing in the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I allow myself for a couple of minutes per month maybe to be really sentimental and romanticizing about it. As the years go past, I grow more and more fond of that whole little intermission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you keep the Sinatra albums?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used them as frisbees in the Philadelphia night, ceremoniously chucking them as far as I possibly could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks Fredrik! Tune in Monday for my second conversation about this unique performance, with the director, who actually met with Dylan himself to plan the taping. That one will go out only to paid subscribers, so sign up/upgrade if you want to read it [update: it’s here]:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, productivity growth in advanced economies began to slow down. Productivity growth — the component of GDP growth that is not due to increases in labor and capital — is the primary driver of rising incomes. When it slows, so does economic growth as a whole. This makes it an urgent trend to understand. Unfortunately, the most popular explanation for why it’s happening might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The most widely endorsed reason productivity growth has faltered is that we are running out of good ideas. As this narrative has it, the many scientific and technology advances responsible for driving economic growth in the past were low-hanging fruit. Now the tree is more barren. Novel advances, we should expect, are harder to come by, and historical growth may thus be difficult to sustain. In the extreme, this may lead to the end of progress altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This story began in 2020, with the publication of “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?,” by economists Nicholas Bloom and colleagues. Bloom et al. looked across many sectors, from agriculture to medicine to computing. In each field, productivity measures have grown at the same rate as before. This sounds like good news, except that the number of researchers in each of these fields has exploded. In other words, each researcher produces much less than they used to — something you might expect if ideas really are getting harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The progress studies movement and the metascience community have risen, in part, in response to this challenge. Both seek ways to rethink how we do research: by making our research institutions more efficient or by increasing science funding. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But there's a growing body of evidence that suggests ideas are not, in fact, getting harder to find. Instead, the problem appears to be that markets have become less effective at translating breakthrough technologies into productivity gains. Researchers appear to be continuing to generate valuable innovations at historical rates. It’s just that these innovations face greater barriers to commercialization, and innovative firms thus fail to gain market share. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All this suggests that the constraint on growth isn’t in our universities or labs or R&amp;amp;D departments, but in our markets.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why ideas matter&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Historically, the task of growth theory has been to rationalize this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Through two world wars, the Great Depression, the global financial crisis, and the Cold War, US real GDP per capita has grown steadily at 2% per year. This consistency is remarkable, so much so that it has motivated economists to search for a near-immutable source of economic growth: something fundamental that drives growth across long sweeps of time. Sure, growth can be affected in the short run by policies and events of the day — tariffs, wars, demographic transitions, educational booms — but it would be an incredible coincidence if the combined impact of every economic policy and external event in history happened to net out as a constant growth rate! So what could this immutable mechanism be?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It took economists decades to understand how sustained exponential growth is even possible. Exponential growth requires increasing returns to scale — doubling all the inputs into production must more than double the scale of economic output. Why? Each year output has to be reinvested as capital to produce next year’s output. But there’s diminishing returns to capital alone, so each year a country would need to reinvest a larger fraction of its annual output to get the same growth rate. Eventually, it would need to reinvest more than 100% of its output, which is impossible. It is only through increasing returns to scale that we can counteract the diminishing returns to capital, allowing us to maintain exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So it’s easy! We just posit increasing returns to scale in production, and we now have an explanation for why growth is exponential — decades of research not necessary. The problem is that increasing returns to scale violates our basic intuitions. Imagine you own a factory that produces 100 cars a day. You create an exact duplicate of this factory in another city, with the same employees, same equipment. How many cars would you expect from both factories combined? The intuitive assumption is 200. Increasing returns demands that we can somehow get more than double the cars from creating the second factory — which is hard to justify. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The economist Paul Romer won a Nobel Prize for resolving this puzzle: Increasing returns to scale comes from ideas. In his view, it is a mistake to think that the only inputs to the car factory are the workers and machines. There are also blueprints for the cars being produced, instructions for how the machines should be laid out, and the concept of an assembly line process to organize the workers. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Romer’s work elegantly solved the problem posed by our factory duplication thought experiment. In setting up the second factory, we needed only to duplicate the workers and the machines — we didn’t need to duplicate the designs or the idea of an assembly line. Once created, ideas can be used in perpetuity, which is how we can double the factory’s output while doubling only its physical inputs. This key property of ideas — that they can be used by everyone at the same time — has become the fundamental explanation for exponential growth. This is why it matters so much if ideas truly are getting harder to find: If idea production is slowing down, it threatens the foundation that allows growth to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The simple argument for declining idea productivity&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To test whether our research efforts are getting less bang for their buck today than they did decades ago, Bloom et al. use a key feature that descends from Romer’s original model — that productivity growth can be represented by the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Productivity growth = Research productivity * Number of researchers &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether total factor productivity, or agricultural yields, or chip density, growth of any productivity measure should be a direct function of the number of researchers working in that sector and their research productivity. This means that if we observe productivity growth in any given sector, and we know the number of researchers working in that sector, we can infer research productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Thus, the authors compile data on productivity growth and researcher counts across a number of different sectors to estimate whether research productivity has been falling, which according to the authors, means ideas must be getting harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Perhaps their most compelling evidence comes from Moore's Law, the famous observation that the number of transistors on a computer chip doubles roughly every two years. This doubling represents a constant 35% annual growth rate in chip density that has held for 50 years. On its face, Moore’s Law seems like a refutation of any diminishment in technological progress. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet maintaining the exponential growth in chip density has required exponential increases in effort. Bloom et al. compiled R&amp;amp;D spending data from dozens of semiconductor firms over time and found that the effective number of researchers working to advance Moore's Law increased by a factor of 18 between 1971 and 2014. Meanwhile, the growth rate of chip density has stayed constant. Put differently, it takes 18 times as many researchers today to achieve the same rate of improvement in chip density as it did in the early 1970s. This implies that research productivity in semiconductors has fallen at an average rate of 7% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Look at agricultural productivity and you see a similar pattern. The authors measure crop yield growth across major US crops. Between 1969 and 2009, yield growth for these crops averaged a steady 1.5% per year, but the research effort directed toward improving yields has grown by between sixfold and 24-fold, depending on the crop. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Zoom all the way out, and the pattern still holds. Across the economy as a whole, R&amp;amp;D efforts have increased by a factor of 20 since the 1930s, yet productivity growth has become slower.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These results are unambiguous. Research effort has gone up, yet productivity growth is not budging. This seems like clear evidence that something about productivity growth is getting harder. But whether the problem is a lack of new ideas is much less obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Measuring idea productivity directly&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The idea-based growth model is successful as a simple description of how exponential growth could occur. The problem is we’ve taken it too literally. Bloom et al. assume that idea production is the only factor behind productivity growth. For example, their agricultural case study uses crop yield growth as the sole variable for new ideas. This allows them to sidestep difficulties in defining ideas and measuring their impact, but it also rules out the possibility that factors other than ideas are the real reason yields are stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Imagine that agricultural R&amp;amp;D spending was highly effective, and that in the past few decades it led to a stream of new seed varieties that were each higher-yield than the last. What if those seeds were not actually being purchased by farmers — maybe because farmers were unaware that they existed or because adopting a new seed is risky? We would observe crop yields stagnating despite R&amp;amp;D spending effectively creating more productive crops. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bloom et al.’s measure of "ideas" combines actual research innovations with other necessary conditions for research innovations to translate into higher output. After being invented, technologies have to be successfully commercialized, marketed, and adopted at scale before they can have large effects on economic output. What if we’re still just as good at producing ideas, but we’ve become much worse at capitalizing on them? &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is exactly the argument made by Teresa Fort and colleagues in a paper from April of this year: “Growth Is Getting Harder to Find, Not Ideas.” Fort et al. use the census of firms linked to US patent filings to capture economy-wide invention, rather than focusing on sector-specific case studies. Most importantly, they measure idea production more directly, by estimating the relationship between R&amp;amp;D spending and new patents rather than inferring idea production from firm growth. Since patents represent technologies that are novel enough to be given intellectual property protection, and also economically valuable enough to be worth patenting, they serve as a more direct measure of “ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fort et al. find that, across firms, research expenditure today continues to be associated with a proportional increase in patents similar to the 1980s. They use a variety of measures to get at this, but the most transparent one is to measure the ratio between patents and R&amp;amp;D expenditures for each firm. Doing this, they find that the average firm’s patent-to-R&amp;amp;D ratio has actually increased by 50% since 1977 — contrary to a story in which R&amp;amp;D effort is becoming less effective. While there is enough variability in this ratio that Fort et al. can’t be confident that it has actually increased, we can certainly say that it hasn’t fallen in the way that Bloom et al. would predict.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The obvious question is whether these patents might represent less generative and useful ideas, something like more incremental advances than patents of the past. Maybe the low-hanging fruit really is gone, and new patents are capturing less useful ideas. Fort et al. address this issue by focusing on breakthrough patents, a measure of technological innovation defined by Kelly et al., and showing that their results still hold.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a technology to count as a breakthrough, it must be generative — technologies that come after must build on it. This idea is the basis for Kelly et al.’s measurement of a patent’s significance. They score a patent as breakthrough if its text is different from patents that came before it but similar to the text of patents that came after it. Patents that scored in the top 5% on this measure included the elevator, the typewriter, the telephone, and frozen foods — giving us some assurance that this measure really selects high-quality technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fort et al. show that their results are not simply coming from more incremental patents over time. Not only has the number of patents filed per R&amp;amp;D dollar increased, but the number of breakthrough patents per R&amp;amp;D dollar has also increased. Firms produce three times more breakthrough patents per R&amp;amp;D dollar than they did in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This analysis suggests that Bloom et al. jumped the gun by attributing the slowdown in productivity growth to declining research productivity. If you infer research productivity only from output growth, it’s hard to find. But if you look at new idea production through the lens of patent data, we appear to be as generative as ever. So there must be some other failure in translating new technologies into productivity growth. What could that be?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The fault in our markets&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We now have a puzzle — productivity growth is slowing down, yet the factor that we think of as the most important determinant of productivity growth is not. The way to resolve this is to let go of the view that ideas are the only factor that determine growth. Remember, the power of that view is its ability to explain growth in the long run — to generate the graph of steady 2% growth over one and a half centuries of war, changes in trade policy, and wide political shifts. Various factors can absolutely drag down growth rates over shorter periods: Growth was visibly lower during the Great Depression, only recovering because of catch-up growth in the boom that followed World War II. Our challenge is to explain the slower growth over a longer period. There is mounting evidence that a factor more obvious than “ideas are harder to find” is responsible: specifically, a decline in market efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first indication comes from Fort et al.’s analysis. In addition to focusing on breakthrough patents, Fort et al. consider a measure of patent value based on stock market returns from Kogan et al. The authors estimate how much a (publicly traded) firm's stock price moves in response to a patent being granted and use this movement as a measure of how valuable the patent is. This measure is unique in that it doesn't capture only the value of the technology but also all factors that go into making a technology profitable for its inventors. So it is notable that contrary to their main results, Fort et al. find that the stock market value of the average patent has actually fallen over time. In other words, the market places lower commercial value on new technologies compared with before. Since the authors also show that the number of breakthrough patents per dollar has actually increased, this is puzzling — somehow, firms are making better technologies than before but getting smaller rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This result gels with a broader view in the productivity literature — that the primary limitation on productivity growth is whether more productive firms can outcompete less productive firms. Intuitively, productivity across the economy is not just the simple average of each firm’s productivity; it’s the market share-weighted average of each firm’s productivity. This means that productivity growth across the economy relies not just on firms finding ways to produce new goods at lower costs (which is where “ideas” would help) — it relies on the best firms being able to gain market share, to increase their contribution to aggregate productivity. This ability for better firms to compete is known as allocative efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So has allocative efficiency decreased in advanced economies, and can that explain the productivity slowdown? Decker et al. use the same census of US firms to show that it has. On average, each firm’s productivity has grown at the same rate as before, but less productive firms have actually gained market share over more productive firms. These two factors together can explain why productivity growth has slowed down. Firms have maintained their innovative capacity, but the market is much less rewarding of that innovative capacity than it has been in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the same spirit, Akcigit and Ates argue that the most important factor behind the fall in allocative efficiency is a drop in the rate at which lagging firms catch up to leader firms in an industry. They consider several possible factors that could influence how dynamic the economy is — corporate taxes, R&amp;amp;D subsidies, entry costs, and catch-up rates for lagging firms — and analyze which of them is most responsible for falling allocative efficiency. They find that almost all of the decline in allocative efficiency is explained by lagging firms failing to catch up. This tells us that the problem of declining allocative efficiency has a rather specific form: Less productive firms stay on as market leaders, while more productive firms are unable to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a puzzle! Why would the market fail to reward innovative firms, or, conversely, why does it continue rewarding less innovative firms? Unfortunately, here we don’t have clear answers. It could be that incumbent firms leverage market power to prevent innovative competitors from gaining market share. Perhaps regulatory barriers make it harder for new entrants to compete with incumbents. Financial markets may also have become less effective at identifying and funding high-potential firms. Answering this question is going to be central to addressing the productivity slowdown and should be a major focus for progress studies.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Progress studies needs to go to market&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The distinction between “ideas are getting harder to find” and “growth is getting harder to achieve” changes what we should focus on to accelerate progress. If the source of slowing growth was actually that each new scientific or technological breakthrough requires exponentially more effort, then progress-oriented thinkers would be right to focus on science funding, peer review, and the culture of scientific research. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However if ideas remain as discoverable as ever, but their economic impact is fading, then we need to look downstream from the laboratory. The decline in allocative efficiency should be more of a main focus — we need to throw more of our intellectual capital at understanding how to increase competitiveness and the market potential for innovative firms and technologies, in the same way that we've focused on understanding how to make better technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The narrative that "ideas are getting harder to find" has profoundly shaped how economists and policymakers think about innovation and growth. It implies we're fighting against some fundamental law of diminishing returns in human creativity. But what we’re actually fighting against is a flaw in our markets that prevents that creativity from being rewarded economically. If we want to restore growth, we should stop worrying about whether we've picked all the low-hanging fruit and start taking that fruit to market.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Audio streaming platform SoundCloud has confirmed that outages and VPN connection issues over the past few days were caused by a security breach in which threat actors stole a database containing user information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disclosure follows widespread reports over the past four days from users who were unable to access SoundCloud when connecting via VPN, with attempts resulting in the site displaying 403 "forbidden" errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement shared with BleepingComputer, SoundCloud said it recently detected unauthorized activity involving an ancillary service dashboard and activated its incident response procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SoundCloud acknowledged that a threat actor accessed some of its data but said the exposure was limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We understand that a purported threat actor group accessed certain limited data that we hold," SoundCloud told BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We have completed an investigation into the data that was impacted, and no sensitive data (such as financial or password data) has been accessed. The data involved consisted only of email addresses and information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BleepingComputer has learned that the breach affects 20% of SoundCloud’s users, which, based on publicly reported user figures, could impact roughly 28 million accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company said it is confident that all unauthorized access to SoundCloud systems has been blocked and that there is no ongoing risk to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with third-party cybersecurity experts, the company said it took additional steps to strengthen its security, including improving monitoring and threat detection, reviewing identity and access controls, and conducting an assessment of related systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the company's response included a configuration change that disrupted VPN connectivity to the site. SoundCloud has not provided a timeline for when VPN access will be fully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the response, SoundCloud experienced denial-of-service attacks that temporarily disabled the platform's web availability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While SoundCloud has not shared details about the threat actor behind the breach, BleepingComputer received a tip earlier today stating that the ShinyHunters extortion gang was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our source said that ShinyHunters is now extorting SoundCloud after allegedly stealing a database containing information about its users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ShinyHunters is also responsible for the PornHub data breach that was first reported today by BleepingComputer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a developing story, and we will update it as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was wrestling with a major life decision. Like I've grown used to doing, I opened Claude and started thinking out loud-laying out the options, weighing the tradeoffs, asking for perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Midway through the conversation, I paused. I realized how much I'd shared: not just this decision, but months of conversations-personal dilemmas, health questions, financial details, work frustrations, things I hadn't told anyone else. I'd developed a level of candor with my AI assistant that I don't have with most people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then an uncomfortable thought: what if someone was reading all of this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thought didn't let go. As a security researcher, I have the tools to answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Discovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked Wings, our agentic-AI risk engine, to scan for browser extensions with the capability to read and exfiltrate conversations from AI chat platforms. We expected to find a handful of obscure extensions-low install counts, sketchy publishers, the usual suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results came back with something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Near the top of the list: Urban VPN Proxy. A Chrome extension with over 6 million users. A 4.7-star rating from 58,000 reviews. A "Featured" badge from Google, meaning it had passed manual review and met what Google describes as "a high standard of user experience and design."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A free VPN promising privacy and security. Exactly the kind of tool someone installs when they want to protect themselves online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We decided to look closer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What We Found&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gemini&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft Copilot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perplexity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grok (xAI)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta AI&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated "executor" script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension's configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How It Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the technical breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Script injection into AI platforms&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extension monitors your browser tabs. When you visit any of the targeted AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), it injects an "executor" script directly into the page. Each platform has its own dedicated script - chatgpt.js, claude.js, gemini.js, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Overriding native browser functions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once injected, the script overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest - the fundamental browser APIs that handle all network requests. This is an aggressive technique. The script wraps the original functions so that every network request and response on that page passes through the extension's code first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means when Claude sends you a response, or when you submit a prompt to ChatGPT, the extension sees the raw API traffic before your browser even renders it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Parsing and packaging&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The injected script parses the intercepted API responses to extract conversation data - your prompts, the AI's responses, timestamps, conversation IDs. This data is packaged and sent via window.postMessage to the extension's content script, tagged with the identifier PANELOS_MESSAGE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Exfiltration via background worker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The content script forwards the data to the extension's background service worker, which handles the actual exfiltration. The data is compressed and transmitted to Urban VPN's servers at endpoints including analytics.urban-vpn.com and stats.urban-vpn.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What gets captured:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every prompt you send to the AI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every response you receive&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conversation identifiers and timestamps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Session metadata&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The specific AI platform and model used&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Timeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AI conversation harvesting wasn't always there. Based on our analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before version 5.5.0: No AI harvesting functionality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 9, 2025: Version 5.5.0 released with AI harvesting enabled by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2025 - Present: All user conversations with targeted AI platforms captured and exfiltrated&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome and Edge extensions auto-update by default. Users who installed Urban VPN for its stated purpose - VPN functionality - woke up one day with new code silently harvesting their AI conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or the other targeted platforms while Urban VPN was installed after July 9, 2025 should assume those conversations are now on Urban VPN's servers and have been shared with third parties. Medical questions, financial details, proprietary code, personal dilemmas - all of it, sold for "marketing analytics purposes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What "AI Protection" Actually Does&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urban VPN's Chrome Web Store listing promotes "AI protection" as a feature:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Advanced VPN Protection - Our VPN provides added security features to help shield your browsing experience from phishing attempts, malware, intrusive ads and AI protection which checks prompts for personal data (like an email or phone number), checks AI chat responses for suspicious or unsafe links and displays a warning before click or submit your prompt."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The framing suggests the AI monitoring exists to protect you-checking for sensitive data you might accidentally share, warning you about suspicious links in responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code tells a different story. The data collection and the "protection" notifications operate independently. Enabling or disabling the warning feature has no effect on whether your conversations are captured and exfiltrated. The extension harvests everything regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The protection feature shows occasional warnings about sharing sensitive data with AI companies. The harvesting feature sends that exact sensitive data - and everything else - to Urban VPN's own servers, where it's sold to advertisers. The extension warns you about sharing your email with ChatGPT while simultaneously exfiltrating your entire conversation to a data broker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It Gets Worse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After documenting Urban VPN Proxy's behavior, we checked whether the same code existed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It did. The identical AI harvesting functionality appears in seven other extensions from the same publisher, across both Chrome and Edge:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome Web Store:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Urban VPN Proxy - 6,000,000 users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1ClickVPN Proxy - 600,000 users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Urban Browser Guard - 40,000 users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Urban Ad Blocker - 10,000 users&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Edge Add-ons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Urban VPN Proxy - 1,323,622 users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1ClickVPN Proxy - 36,459 users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Urban Browser Guard - 12,624 users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Urban Ad Blocker - 6,476 users&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total affected users: Over 8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extensions span different product categories, a VPN, an ad blocker, a "browser guard" security tool, but share the same surveillance backend. Users installing an ad blocker have no reason to expect their Claude conversations are being harvested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these extensions carry "Featured" badges from their respective stores, except Urban Ad Blocker for Edge. These badges signal to users that the extensions have been reviewed and meet platform quality standards. For many users, a Featured badge is the difference between installing an extension and passing it by - it's an implicit endorsement from Google and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who's Behind This&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urban VPN is operated by Urban Cyber Security Inc., which is affiliated with BiScience (B.I Science (2009) Ltd.), a data broker company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This company has been on researchers' radar before. Security researchers Wladimir Palant and John Tuckner at Secure Annex have previously documented BiScience's data collection practices. Their research established that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BiScience collects clickstream data (browsing history) from millions of users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data is tied to persistent device identifiers, enabling re-identification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The company provides an SDK to third-party extension developers to collect and sell user data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BiScience sells this data through products like AdClarity and Clickstream OS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our finding represents an expansion of this operation. BiScience has moved from collecting browsing history to harvesting complete AI conversations-a significantly more sensitive category of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The privacy policy confirms the data flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We share the Web Browsing Data with our affiliated company... BiScience that uses this raw data and creates insights which are commercially used and shared with Business Partners"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Disclosure Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, Urban VPN does disclose some of this-if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consent prompt (shown during extension setup) mentions that the extension processes "ChatAI communication" along with "pages you visit" and "security signals." It states this is done "to provide these protections."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Screenshot: Urban VPN consent prompt]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The privacy policy goes further, buried deep in the document:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"AI Inputs and Outputs. As part of the Browsing Data, we will collect the prompts and outputs queried by the End-User or generated by the AI chat provider, as applicable."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We also disclose the AI prompts for marketing analytics purposes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the Chrome Web Store listing-the place where users actually decide whether to install-shows a different picture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This developer declares that your data is Not being sold to third parties, outside of the approved use cases"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The listing mentions the extension handles "Web history" and "Website content." It says nothing about AI conversations specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contradictions are significant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The consent prompt frames AI monitoring as protective. The privacy policy reveals the data is sold for marketing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The store listing says data isn't sold to third parties. The privacy policy describes sharing with BiScience, "Business Partners," and use for "marketing analytics."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Users who installed before July 2025 never saw the updated consent prompt-the AI harvesting was added via silent update in version 5.5.0.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even users who see the consent prompt have no granular control. You can't accept the VPN but decline the AI harvesting. It's all or nothing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nothing indicates to users that the data collection continues even when the VPN is disconnected and the AI protection feature is turned off. The harvesting runs silently in the background regardless of what features the user has enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Google's Role&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urban VPN Proxy carries Google's "Featured" badge on the Chrome Web Store. According to Google's documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Featured extensions follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Before it receives a Featured badge, the Chrome Web Store team must review each extension."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means a human at Google reviewed Urban VPN Proxy and concluded it met their standards. Either the review didn't examine the code that harvests conversations from Google's own AI product (Gemini), or it did and didn't consider this a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chrome Web Store's Limited Use policy explicitly prohibits "transferring or selling user data to third parties like advertising platforms, data brokers, or other information resellers." BiScience is, by its own description, a data broker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extension remains live and featured as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browser extensions occupy a unique position of trust. They run in the background, have broad access to your browsing activity, and auto-update without asking. When an extension promises privacy and security, users have little reason to suspect it's doing the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this case notable isn't just the scale - 8 million users - or the sensitivity of the data - complete AI conversations. It's that these extensions passed review, earned Featured badges, and remained live for months while harvesting some of the most personal data users generate online. The marketplaces designed to protect users instead gave these extensions their stamp of approval.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any of these extensions installed, uninstall them now. Assume any AI conversations you've had since July 2025 have been captured and shared with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This writeup was authored by the research team at Koi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built Koi to detect exactly these kinds of threats - extensions that slip past marketplace reviews and quietly exfiltrate sensitive data. Our risk engine, Wings, continuously monitors browser extensions to catch threats before they reach your team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Book a demo to see how behavioral analysis catches what static review misses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;
