    &lt;p&gt;We, the Xfce team are excited to share some great news!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After careful consideration, we’ve decided on a meaningful way to use the generous donations from our community: funding longtime Xfce core developer Brian Tarricone to create xfwl4, a brand-new Wayland compositor for Xfce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This initiative will utilize a significant portion of the project’s donated funds, but we believe it’s an important investment in Xfce’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is, that xfwl4 will offer the same functionality and behavior as xfwm4 does, or as much as possible considering the differences between X11 and Wayland. Using xfwl4 should feel just like using xfwm4 on X11. We even plan to reuse the existing xfwm4 configuration dialogs and xfconf settings to ensure a seamless transition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xfwl4 will not be based on the existing xfwm4 code. Instead, it will be written from scratch in rust, using smithay building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first attempt at creating an Xfce Wayland compositor involved modifying the existing xfwm4 code to support both X11 and Wayland in parallel. However, this approach turned out to be the wrong path forward for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the decision to write a compositor from scratch was done, the next major question was: Which Wayland support library to use as a base? In order to find an answer on that question Brian evaluated wlroots and smithay. The decision to use smithay as a base was done for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides getting feature parity with xfwm4, the xfwl4 project scope includes as well some other related tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brian has already started work on the project, so stay tuned for the first development release of xfwl4, which we hope to share around mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in the detailed reasoning behind the project or want to explore all the technical details, check out the issues and the work in progress source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For any questions related to xfwl4, please visit our Matrix channel #xfce-dev.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our generous supporters on Open Collective US and Open Collective EU for making this project possible!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best regards,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Xfce development team&lt;/p&gt;

The company blames tech issues</title><updated>2026-01-27T21:09:35.195076+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="f59ddc90a068ae91"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comedian Megan Stalter, who posts absurd character skits to an audience in the high hundreds of thousands across Instagram and TikTok, tried sharing a different kind of video on Saturday night. Driven by the death of Alex Pretti, the nurse shot by a federal immigration agent or agents that day, she had recorded herself urging her fellow Christians to speak out against ICE raids in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have to abolish ICE,” Stalter said in the video. “I truly, truly believe that is exactly what Jesus would do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Instagram, the video was reposted more than 12,000 times. But her plea never made it to TikTok. In a follow-up post on Instagram, she said she had attempted to upload the video to TikTok several times with no success, then had given up and deleted her TikTok account entirely, believing her content was being censored because it was about ICE. (CNN has reached out to Stalter for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other users reported the same combination of events, drawing a circumstantial connection between their efforts to make videos about ICE and the difficulties they had posting them over the weekend. The controversy caught the attention of Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, who said that among “threats to democracy,” the purported censorship on TikTok was “at the top of the list.” (CNN has reached out to Murphy’s office for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok said in a statement that glitches on the app were due to a power outage at a US data center. As a result, a spokesperson for TikTok US Joint Venture told CNN, it’s taking longer for videos to be uploaded and recommended to other users. The tech issues were “unrelated to last week’s news,” TikTok said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning, TikTok US Joint Venture said it had made “significant progress” in restoring service to US users but noted that users may still have trouble uploading new videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, a majority American-owned joint venture took control of TikTok’s assets in the US, in a deal shepherded by the Trump administration under a 2024 law requiring the app to move out from under its previous Chinese ownership or face a ban in the United States. Among its new investors is the tech company Oracle, whose executive chair Larry Ellison is a close affiliate of President Donald Trump. Oracle will store US TikTok users’ data in a “secure US cloud environment,” according to TikTok, and the new joint venture will “have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a private platform, TikTok is free to exert influence on what users can upload or see. Even if accusations of TikTok’s censorship are unprovable, it’s understandable that US users would be increasingly skeptical of the platform in this moment, said Casey Fiesler, an associate professor of technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado, Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s not a lot of trust in the leadership of social media platforms in general,” Fiesler told CNN. “And given the connection of the new ownership of TikTok to the Trump administration, which is so wrapped up in what is happening with ICE in Minnesota, it’s not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TikTok users are concerned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fiesler said she was “unsurprised” about censorship concerns on TikTok, given the timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost immediately after oversight of TikTok’s US operations changed, misinformation started to spread about changes to the app’s new terms of service, including those that applied to location sharing and data collection, Fiesler said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A lot of TikTok users are concerned about what this new ownership means, both with respect to who has access to their data, and how content recommendation might change or could change,” Fiesler said. “I think those are valid concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days ago, Fiesler posted some videos aiming to debunk those rumors about the changes to the terms of service, and those were uploaded without issue. She has attempted to upload two videos since Sunday afternoon, one of which she says is still “under review” by TikTok and can’t be viewed publicly. While both generally alluded to ongoing ICE action in Minneapolis, she used it as a framing device to discuss media literacy. One of the videos did successfully upload on Monday, though its captions and view counter weren’t working for several hours, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Even if this isn’t purposeful censorship, does it matter? In terms of perception and trust, maybe,” Fiesler said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jen Hamilton, a nurse and author with more than 4.5 million TikTok followers, says she became suspicious of TikTok on January 22, the day of the announced change in control in the US, when a video she made about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos being taken by federal agents wouldn’t upload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It was very ironic for that very first day of this takeover, for me to post something about ICE and then it not be viewable to the public,” Hamilton told CNN, adding that the video still can’t be seen by her followers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After she posted a still about Pretti, her next four videos couldn’t be uploaded, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Something has shifted in the way that content is getting put on the platform, or allowed to be on the platform,” she said, while noting that she didn’t have proof of being personally censored. “And I just find it very ironic that it’s the same day that it takes over that people are not being able to post their stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An opaque algorithm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be incredibly difficult to prove TikTok is censoring content about ICE because the platform’s content recommendation process is so opaque, said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor at the University of Cincinnati who studies media law and ethics, among other subjects. Plus, if TikTok were intentionally censoring content about ICE, it would be within its legal right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’re a private platform. They have a First Amendment right to do that,” he said. “A lot of times it’s easy for us to think of social media as a public square, but it’s not public in a way that matters under the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some users, like Stalter, are deleting their accounts and leaving the app altogether (though some have also had trouble deleting their accounts, Fiesler noted). The daily average of TikTok uninstalls are up nearly 150% in the last five days compared to the last three months, market firm SensorTower told CNBC on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If people leave TikTok now, I suspect it’s a combination of things, not just because some videos weren’t posted on one day. It’s also concerns about what this means for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hamilton said while she’s exploring options like Substack and Patreon, where followers can pay to hear her unvarnished thoughts, she won’t fully abandon TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This whole thing is intended to dissuade people, especially who are sharing a narrative that is not similar to what the government is wanting people to hear,” she said she suspects. “I think the purpose of having those people feel like their content is not safe on this platform is to get them to stop speaking out, or use the platform differently, or play by the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She’s already figured out ways to continue to talk about ICE, she said. In a video that did make it through TikTok’s uploading process, she calls herself a “fashion influencer” and speaks in code about her trouble uploading an earlier video about Liam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fashion influencing is in my blood,” she said in the video, with a photo of Liam behind her. “And even a company with bad customer service won’t keep me from doing my fashion review.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is shuttering its Amazon-branded grocery stores and automated grab-and-go markets, eliminating two centerpieces of its push into physical retail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go stores will close, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday, with some locations converted into Whole Foods Market stores.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“While we’ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,” Amazon said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moves mark the e-commerce giant’s latest retreat from its brick-and-mortar retail efforts. Since the surprise opening of a physical bookstore in 2015, Amazon has tried and failed to establish a foothold under its own brand in categories from groceries to fashion, often with technological flourishes such as digital price tags or novel checkout methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the company has backed away from the bookstores, an eclectic kitchen goods, toys and electronics store called Amazon 4-Star, electronics kiosks in shopping malls and a short-lived clothing storefront.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon on Tuesday said it would continue to invest in groceries sold both online and offline. That includes an ongoing effort to stock more produce and perishables in Amazon’s same-day delivery warehouses and at more Whole Foods stores, which comprise more than 550 locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon currently operates 14 Go stores, which use cameras to track what people grab off the shelves, and 58 Amazon Fresh grocery stores, according to its website. The last day of operation for most of those stores will be Sunday, a spokesperson said, except in California, where they’ll stay open longer to comply with state requirements for advance notice of closures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moves mean thousands of hourly workers in the stores will lose their jobs. Cuts to Amazon’s corporate workforce will likely involve dozens of people, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because the information was confidential. The company says it will work to help employees find other jobs at Amazon, including at Whole Foods stores or in its logistics network. Amazon’s corporate ranks were already bracing for a round of layoffs expected as soon as this week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The main reason behind the decision is that neither Fresh nor Go stores were delivering the sales needed to make them fully economic,” Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with GlobalData, said in emailed comments. “Nor were they producing growth trajectories that might convincingly reverse that position.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It’s understandable if you missed it, but coding agents are getting good [^1]. Throughout 2025 they went from interesting in limited circumstances, to nearly there, to being able to generate and review code at a surprisingly advanced level. As coding agents have been able to take on more and more complex tasks, it’s no surprise more and more folks want to bring them to work, even if their company’s tooling and policies are far from ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With growing interest in coding agents—not only from individual engineers, but also executives looking for force multipliers—security, IT, and engineering management are left with a difficult question: How can they enable secure, visible AI usage, without putting up roadblocks that engineers will work around?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We heard from countless customers that they don’t have a good answer to this. The thing is, neither did we. So we built one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bringing AI usage into focus with Aperture by Tailscale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aperture, currently in alpha release, is an AI gateway that provides visibility into coding agent usage across your entire organization without getting in the way of developers. It works great with most CLI or VS-Code-based AI coding tools, including Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and custom agent frameworks. It uses the underlying identity built into every Tailscale connection to eliminate distributing API keys to developer laptops, VMs, containers, CI/CD platforms (e.g. GitHub Actions), and other sandbox environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any environment that can connect via Tailscale can use Aperture to eliminate keys and improve visibility. From an end-user perspective, setting up Aperture with an agent like Claude Code is as simple as adding the following to &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/settings.json&lt;/code&gt;, either manually or via MDM:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "apiKeyHelper": "echo '-'",
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://ai"
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Save time with just one key to rule them all&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giving developers or agents within your organization access to new models or providers is as simple as adding a single API key and endpoint to Aperture's settings. Once a new provider is added, Aperture associates user and machine identities with API usage, while transparently passing along traffic to the LLM provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Aperture picks up identity information from your Tailscale network (tailnet), there is no need to set up user accounts or keys. Out of the gate, Aperture supports all major LLM providers using their native protocols, as well as most major cloud AI endpoints, self-hosted LLMs, and LLM inference providers that conform to the OpenAI v1 response or chat completions endpoint specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Make usage visible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The visibility provided by Aperture can be used in two main ways. The first is to understand AI adoption across an organization. The second is to look for signs of compromised or unapproved usage of agents or tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Understand AI adoption and cost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Models, agents, and AI usage best practices are constantly changing, and sometimes seemingly innocuous changes can have drastic impacts on tokens and, by extension, cost. By collecting usage information into a single place, engineering and IT leaders can get a complete picture into both user and agent token efficiency across the organization and providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secure everything with simple access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When users feel security postures are too cumbersome, they’ll work around them and end up out on their own, unmonitored and unprotected. When deployed, Aperture quickly becomes the lowest-friction way to access AI at your company, while seamlessly attaching existing machine and user identities to logs, sessions, local tool calls, and local or remote MCP tool calls. All information can be easily viewed, filtered, and sorted inside Aperture, while also exported to S3 for easy SIEM integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A platform on a platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Aperture itself is built on the Tailscale platform to leverage the built-in identity and connectivity, we’re making Aperture extensible as well. As part of making the safe way of providing AI access the easy way, we’ve made Aperture extensible, so that any company can provide detailed AI agent security features on top of Aperture. One of the first companies we'll be partnering with is Oso, to provide additional visibility, controls, alerting, and auditing for AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Visibility into coding agents is just the beginning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our initial alpha release of Aperture, we’ve focused mostly on providing security and insights for coding agent usage. But coding agents, we believe, are just the beginning of the proverbial agentic AI iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in addition to expanding Aperture to cover more typical chat-UI-based use cases, we’re also planning support for other agentic workloads. Inside organizations there are tons of other processes beyond coding, waiting for their coding agent moment. And, Aperture will be there to provide the right visibility, control, convenience, and ease of use to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to get started with Aperture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try it out today for free by signing up here. Like the Tailscale Personal plan, Aperture comes with similar usage limits of 3 free users. However, it can be used on any plan type. If you are trying to safely deploy coding agents for 10s, 100s, or 1000s of engineers inside your organization or building internal agents, sign up for the waitlist. We’d be happy to walk through your requirements and set you up with a dedicated instance of Aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that this is an early alpha release of an experimental product. It’s still a work in progress, so pieces may be incomplete, features may change, and you may experience bugs. We’re sharing it to learn and gather feedback, so before using it in production, please talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;from 3.6.0 before 3.6.1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;from 3.5.0 before 3.5.5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;from 3.4.0 before 3.4.4&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: PBMAC1 parameters in PKCS#12 files are missing validation which can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, invalid pointer or NULL pointer dereference during MAC verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: The stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer dereference may cause a crash leading to Denial of Service for an application that parses untrusted PKCS#12 files. The buffer overflow may also potentially enable code execution depending on platform mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When verifying a PKCS#12 file that uses PBMAC1 for the MAC, the PBKDF2 salt and keylength parameters from the file are used without validation. If the value of keylength exceeds the size of the fixed stack buffer used for the derived key (64 bytes), the key derivation will overflow the buffer. The overflow length is attacker-controlled. Also, if the salt parameter is not an OCTET STRING type this can lead to invalid or NULL pointer dereference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploiting this issue requires a user or application to process a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept untrusted PKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store private keys which are trusted by definition. For this reason the issue was assessed as Moderate severity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5 and 3.4 are not affected by this issue, as PKCS#12 processing is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5 and 3.4 are vulnerable to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue as they do not support PBMAC1 in PKCS#12.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData message with maliciously crafted AEAD parameters can trigger a stack buffer overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial of Service, or potentially remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits the destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an oversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any authentication or tag verification occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using AEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME AuthEnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable. Because the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material is required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution depends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-based write primitive represents a severe risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: If an application using the SSL_CIPHER_find() function in a QUIC protocol client or server receives an unknown cipher suite from the peer, a NULL dereference occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A NULL pointer dereference leads to abnormal termination of the running process causing Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some applications call SSL_CIPHER_find() from the client_hello_cb callback on the cipher ID received from the peer. If this is done with an SSL object implementing the QUIC protocol, NULL pointer dereference will happen if the examined cipher ID is unknown or unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it is not very common to call this function in applications using the QUIC protocol and the worst outcome is Denial of Service, the issue was assessed as Low severity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerable code was introduced in the 3.2 version with the addition of the QUIC protocol support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 and 3.3 are not affected by this issue, as the QUIC implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: The ‘openssl dgst’ command-line tool silently truncates input data to 16MB when using one-shot signing algorithms and reports success instead of an error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A user signing or verifying files larger than 16MB with one-shot algorithms (such as Ed25519, Ed448, or ML-DSA) may believe the entire file is authenticated while trailing data beyond 16MB remains unauthenticated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the ‘openssl dgst’ command is used with algorithms that only support one-shot signing (Ed25519, Ed448, ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, ML-DSA-87), the input is buffered with a 16MB limit. If the input exceeds this limit, the tool silently truncates to the first 16MB and continues without signaling an error, contrary to what the documentation states. This creates an integrity gap where trailing bytes can be modified without detection if both signing and verification are performed using the same affected codepath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issue affects only the command-line tool behavior. Verifiers that process the full message using library APIs will reject the signature, so the risk primarily affects workflows that both sign and verify with the affected ‘openssl dgst’ command. Streaming digest algorithms for ‘openssl dgst’ and library users are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.5 and 3.6 are not affected by this issue, as the command-line tools are outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: A TLS 1.3 connection using certificate compression can be forced to allocate a large buffer before decompression without checking against the configured certificate size limit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: An attacker can cause per-connection memory allocations of up to approximately 22 MiB and extra CPU work, potentially leading to service degradation or resource exhaustion (Denial of Service).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In affected configurations, the peer-supplied uncompressed certificate length from a CompressedCertificate message is used to grow a heap buffer prior to decompression. This length is not bounded by the max_cert_list setting, which otherwise constrains certificate message sizes. An attacker can exploit this to cause large per-connection allocations followed by handshake failure. No memory corruption or information disclosure occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue only affects builds where TLS 1.3 certificate compression is compiled in (i.e., not OPENSSL_NO_COMP_ALG) and at least one compression algorithm (brotli, zlib, or zstd) is available, and where the compression extension is negotiated. Both clients receiving a server CompressedCertificate and servers in mutual TLS scenarios receiving a client CompressedCertificate are affected. Servers that do not request client certificates are not vulnerable to client-initiated attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users can mitigate this issue by setting SSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION to disable receiving compressed certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Writing large, newline-free data into a BIO chain using the line-buffering filter where the next BIO performs short writes can trigger a heap-based out-of-bounds write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: This out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption which typically results in a crash, leading to Denial of Service for an application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The line-buffering BIO filter (BIO_f_linebuffer) is not used by default in TLS/SSL data paths. In OpenSSL command-line applications, it is typically only pushed onto stdout/stderr on VMS systems. Third-party applications that explicitly use this filter with a BIO chain that can short-write and that write large, newline-free data influenced by an attacker would be affected. However, the circumstances where this could happen are unlikely to be under attacker control, and BIO_f_linebuffer is unlikely to be handling non-curated data controlled by an attacker. For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: When using the low-level OCB API directly with AES-NI or&lt;lb/&gt;other hardware-accelerated code paths, inputs whose length is not a multiple&lt;lb/&gt;of 16 bytes can leave the final partial block unencrypted and unauthenticated.&lt;lb/&gt;Impact summary: The trailing 1-15 bytes of a message may be exposed in&lt;lb/&gt;cleartext on encryption and are not covered by the authentication tag,&lt;lb/&gt;allowing an attacker to read or tamper with those bytes without detection.&lt;lb/&gt;The low-level OCB encrypt and decrypt routines in the hardware-accelerated&lt;lb/&gt;stream path process full 16-byte blocks but do not advance the input/output&lt;lb/&gt;pointers. The subsequent tail-handling code then operates on the original&lt;lb/&gt;base pointers, effectively reprocessing the beginning of the buffer while&lt;lb/&gt;leaving the actual trailing bytes unprocessed. The authentication checksum&lt;lb/&gt;also excludes the true tail bytes.&lt;lb/&gt;However, typical OpenSSL consumers using EVP are not affected because the&lt;lb/&gt;higher-level EVP and provider OCB implementations split inputs so that full&lt;lb/&gt;blocks and trailing partial blocks are processed in separate calls, avoiding&lt;lb/&gt;the problematic code path. Additionally, TLS does not use OCB ciphersuites.&lt;lb/&gt;The vulnerability only affects applications that call the low-level&lt;lb/&gt;CRYPTO_ocb128_encrypt() or CRYPTO_ocb128_decrypt() functions directly with&lt;lb/&gt;non-block-aligned lengths in a single call on hardware-accelerated builds.&lt;lb/&gt;For these reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.&lt;lb/&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected&lt;lb/&gt;by this issue, as OCB mode is not a FIPS-approved algorithm.&lt;lb/&gt;OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.&lt;lb/&gt;OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Calling PKCS12_get_friendlyname() function on a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file with a BMPString (UTF-16BE) friendly name containing non-ASCII BMP code point can trigger a one byte write before the allocated buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OPENSSL_uni2utf8() function performs a two-pass conversion of a PKCS#12 BMPString (UTF-16BE) to UTF-8. In the second pass, when emitting UTF-8 bytes, the helper function bmp_to_utf8() incorrectly forwards the remaining UTF-16 source byte count as the destination buffer capacity to UTF8_putc(). For BMP code points above U+07FF, UTF-8 requires three bytes, but the forwarded capacity can be just two bytes. UTF8_putc() then returns -1, and this negative value is added to the output length without validation, causing the length to become negative. The subsequent trailing NUL byte is then written at a negative offset, causing write outside of heap allocated buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is reachable via the public PKCS12_get_friendlyname() API when parsing attacker-controlled PKCS#12 files. While PKCS12_parse() uses a different code path that avoids this issue, PKCS12_get_friendlyname() directly invokes the vulnerable function. Exploitation requires an attacker to provide a malicious PKCS#12 file to be parsed by the application and the attacker can just trigger a one zero byte write before the allocated buffer. For that reason the issue was assessed as Low severity according to our Security Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The functions ossl_ess_get_signing_cert() and ossl_ess_get_signing_cert_v2() access the signing cert attribute value without validating its type. When the type is not V_ASN1_SEQUENCE, this results in accessing invalid memory through the ASN1_TYPE union, causing a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed TimeStamp Response to an application that verifies timestamp responses.

    &lt;p&gt;The PKCS12_item_decrypt_d2i_ex() function does not check whether the oct parameter is NULL before dereferencing it.

    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: An application processing a malformed PKCS#12 file can be caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer on memory read, resulting in a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A type confusion vulnerability exists in PKCS#12 parsing code where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type, causing an invalid pointer read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The location is constrained to a 1-byte address space, meaning any attempted pointer manipulation can only target addresses between 0x00 and 0xFF. This range corresponds to the zero page, which is unmapped on most modern operating systems and will reliably result in a crash, leading only to a Denial of Service. Exploiting this issue also requires a user or application to process a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept untrusted PKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store private keys which are trusted by definition.

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the signature verification of signed PKCS#7 data where an ASN1_TYPE union member is accessed without first validating the type, causing an invalid or NULL pointer dereference when processing malformed PKCS#7 data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: An application performing signature verification of PKCS#7 data or calling directly the PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() function can be caused to dereference an invalid or NULL pointer when reading, resulting in a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function PKCS7_digest_from_attributes() accesses the message digest attribute value without validating its type. When the type is not V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING, this results in accessing invalid memory through the ASN1_TYPE union, causing a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to provide a malformed signed PKCS#7 to an application that verifies it.

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted using password based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability could be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to perform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS messages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed as Moderate severity according to our Security Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remote recovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bit ARM platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bit ARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter, timing measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and so this CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts. However, given that it is possible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled with the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be recoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate severity issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions may trigger an out-of-bounds read if the ’no_proxy’ environment variable is set and the host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applications but they are also used by the OCSP client functions and CMP (Certificate Management Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL. However the URLs used by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash. Furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be passed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have a ’no_proxy’ environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases: 3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Use of -addreject option with the openssl x509 application adds a trusted use instead of a rejected use for a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: If a user intends to make a trusted certificate rejected for a particular use it will be instead marked as trusted for that use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A copy &amp;amp; paste error during minor refactoring of the code introduced this issue in the OpenSSL 3.5 version. If, for example, a trusted CA certificate should be trusted only for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but not for CMS signature verification and the CMS signature verification is intended to be marked as rejected with the -addreject option, the resulting CA certificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl x509 command line application to add rejected uses are affected by this issue. The issues affecting only the command line application are considered to be Low severity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Clients using RFC7250 Raw Public Keys (RPKs) to authenticate a server may fail to notice that the server was not authenticated, because handshakes don’t abort as expected when the SSL_VERIFY_PEER verification mode is set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: TLS and DTLS connections using raw public keys may be vulnerable to man-in-middle attacks when server authentication failure is not detected by clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers. The issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate chain. The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to fail when the server’s RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys, by setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw public key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected. This issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we’re aware of, either only “named curves” are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can’t represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an “exotic” curve encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications working with “exotic” explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution cannot easily be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when comparing the expected name with an &lt;code&gt;otherName&lt;/code&gt; subject alternative name of an
X.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the
application program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, …) is not affected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also specifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they generally don’t perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected identity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the certificate chain. So TLS servers are generally not affected and the severity of the issue is Moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a “no overlap” response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs. We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; parameter) is too large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit the modulus size when performing the checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications when using the &lt;code&gt;-check&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS clients.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass().&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation would take a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the ‘-pubin’ and ‘-check’ options on untrusted data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn’t make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn’t check for an excessively large Q.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the “-pubcheck” option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential truncation or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length, via the “keylen” parameter or the IV length, via the “ivlen” parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation or overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of confidentiality. For example, when following NIST’s SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as security critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application developers will have spotted this problem during testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate severity overall.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().&lt;/p&gt;

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus (‘p’ parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be misled by removing, adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. We are currently unaware of any such applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or data containing them may be very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit. OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with ’n’ being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest passed data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer’s certificate chain. Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern, and the severity is therefore considered low.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the &lt;code&gt;-policy&lt;/code&gt; argument to the command line utilities or by calling the

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer, leading to a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact summary: Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a Low severity one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the “name” (e.g. “CERTIFICATE”), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the “name_out”, “header” and “data” arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls.

    &lt;p&gt;If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup.&lt;/p&gt;

Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server.

    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of &lt;code&gt;OCSP_basic_verify&lt;/code&gt; will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the &lt;code&gt;OCSP_basic_verify&lt;/code&gt; function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL âocspâ application. When verifying an ocsp response with the â-no_cert_checksâ option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701.

That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory).

This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the âoutâ parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the âoutlenâ parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the âoutâ parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSLâs own âd2iâ functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the âdataâ and âlengthâ fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the âdataâ field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a âpurposeâ has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named âpurposeâ values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources.

    &lt;p&gt;The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSLâs s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the â-crl_downloadâ option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSLâs parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked.&lt;/p&gt;

In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites.

Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the âprefix / âopenssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be â/usr/localâ. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of âC:/usr/localâ, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSLâs default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, â/usr/local/sslâ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own âprefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored. It is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique. Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious confidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to the leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique nonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a reused nonce. Additionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the integrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the integrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further affected. Any OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe because no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user applications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable ânon-stitchedâ ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an âerror stateâ mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time.

    &lt;p&gt;There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attackerâs direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the âno-ocspâ build time option are not affected. Servers using OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in a default configuration, instead only if an application explicitly enables OCSP stapling support.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A TLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message. This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL_free() on the failed conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if: 1) The application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner in the event that the connection fails or 2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there is very little free memory or 3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for the connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and there is insufficient memory to service the multiple requests. Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because DES (and triple-DES) has only a 64-bit block size, birthday attacks are a real concern. For example, with the ability to run Javascript in a browser, it is possible to send enough traffic to cause a collision, and then use that information to recover something like a session Cookie. Triple-DES, which shows up as âDES-CBC3â in an OpenSSL cipher string, is still used on the Web, and major browsers are not yet willing to completely disable it. If you run a server, you should disable triple-DES. This is generally a configuration issue. If you run an old server that doesnât support any better ciphers than DES or RC4, you should upgrade. For 1.0.2 and 1.0.1, we removed the triple-DES ciphers from the âHIGHâ keyword and put them into âMEDIUM.â Note that we did not remove them from the âDEFAULTâ keyword. For the 1.1.0 release, we treat triple-DES just like we are treating RC4. It is not compiled by default; you have to use âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ as a config option. Even when those ciphers are compiled, triple-DES is only in the âMEDIUMâ keyword. In addition we also removed it from the âDEFAULTâ keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In a DTLS connection where handshake messages are delivered out-of-order those messages that OpenSSL is not yet ready to process will be buffered for later use. Under certain circumstances, a flaw in the logic means that those messages do not get removed from the buffer even though the handshake has been completed. An attacker could force up to approx. 15 messages to remain in the buffer when they are no longer required. These messages will be cleared when the DTLS connection is closed. The default maximum size for a message is 100k. Therefore the attacker could force an additional 1500k to be consumed per connection. By opening many simulataneous connections an attacker could cause a DoS attack through memory exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

This means that all subsequent legitimate packets are dropped causing a denial of service for a specific DTLS connection.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Avoid some undefined pointer arithmetic A common idiom in the codebase is to check limits in the following manner: âp + len &amp;gt; limitâ Where âpâ points to some mallocâd data of SIZE bytes and limit == p + SIZE âlenâ here could be from some externally supplied data (e.g. from a TLS message). The rules of C pointer arithmetic are such that âp + lenâ is only well defined where len &amp;lt;= SIZE. Therefore the above idiom is actually undefined behaviour. For example this could cause problems if some malloc implementation provides an address for âpâ such that âp + lenâ actually overflows for values of len that are too big and therefore p + len &amp;lt; limit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Internally to OpenSSL the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM_write_bio* family of functions. These are mainly used within the OpenSSL command line applications. These internal uses are not considered vulnerable because all calls are bounded with length checks so no overflow is possible. User applications that call these APIs directly with large amounts of untrusted data may be vulnerable. (Note: Initial analysis suggested that the PEM_write_bio* were vulnerable, and this is reflected in the patch commit message. This is no longer believed to be the case).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Following an analysis of all OpenSSL internal usage of the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function all usage is one of two forms. The first form is where the EVP_EncryptUpdate() call is known to be the first called function after an EVP_EncryptInit(), and therefore that specific call must be safe. The second form is where the length passed to EVP_EncryptUpdate() can be seen from the code to be some small value and therefore there is no possibility of an overflow. Since all instances are one of these two forms, it is believed that there can be no overflows in internal code due to this problem. It should be noted that EVP_DecryptUpdate() can call EVP_EncryptUpdate() in certain code paths. Also EVP_CipherUpdate() is a synonym for EVP_EncryptUpdate(). All instances of these calls have also been analysed too and it is believed there are no instances in internal usage where an overflow could occur. This could still represent a security issue for end user code that calls this function directly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A MITM attacker can use a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server support AES-NI. This issue was introduced as part of the fix for Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169). The padding check was rewritten to be in constant time by making sure that always the same bytes are read and compared against either the MAC or padding bytes. But it no longer checked that there was enough data to have both the MAC and padding bytes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This issue affected versions of OpenSSL prior to April 2015. The bug causing the vulnerability was fixed on April 18th 2015, and released as part of the June 11th 2015 security releases. The security impact of the bug was not known at the time. In previous versions of OpenSSL, ASN.1 encoding the value zero represented as a negative integer can cause a buffer underflow with an out-of-bounds write in i2c_ASN1_INTEGER. The ASN.1 parser does not normally create ânegative zeroesâ when parsing ASN.1 input, and therefore, an attacker cannot trigger this bug. However, a second, independent bug revealed that the ASN.1 parser (specifically, d2i_ASN1_TYPE) can misinterpret a large universal tag as a negative zero value. Large universal tags are not present in any common ASN.1 structures (such as X509) but are accepted as part of ANY structures. Therefore, if an application deserializes untrusted ASN.1 structures containing an ANY field, and later reserializes them, an attacker may be able to trigger an out-of-bounds write. This has been shown to cause memory corruption that is potentially exploitable with some malloc implementations. Applications that parse and re-encode X509 certificates are known to be vulnerable. Applications that verify RSA signatures on X509 certificates may also be vulnerable; however, only certificates with valid signatures trigger ASN.1 re-encoding and hence the bug. Specifically, since OpenSSLâs default TLS X509 chain verification code verifies the certificate chain from root to leaf, TLS handshakes could only be targeted with valid certificates issued by trusted Certification Authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When ASN.1 data is read from a BIO using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio() a short invalid encoding can casuse allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming excessive resources or exhausting memory. Any application parsing untrusted data through d2i BIO functions is affected. The memory based functions such as d2i_X509() are not affected. Since the memory based functions are used by the TLS library, TLS applications are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This issue only affected versions of OpenSSL prior to March 19th 2015 at which time the code was refactored to address vulnerability CVE-2015-0293. s2_srvr.c did not enforce that clear-key-length is 0 for non-export ciphers. If clear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they displace encrypted-key bytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an eavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an oracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the server and negligible computation. More importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is effective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant computation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value |i|. Later |bn_expand| is called with a value of |i * 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn_expand| not allocating any memory because |i * 4| is negative. This can leave the internal BIGNUM data field as NULL leading to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the calculation |i * 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this case memory is allocated to the internal BIGNUM data field, but it is insufficiently sized leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn. This could have security consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is anticipated to be a rare occurrence. All OpenSSL internal usage of these functions use data that is not expected to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security consequences. This is also anticipated to be rare.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had confusing memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way of distinguishing these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around 300 bytes per connection. Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure a seed are not vulnerable. In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed. To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate to SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user. However, note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular, computations are currently not carried out in constant time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a â%sâ format string in the BIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings. Additionally the internal |doapr_outch| function can attempt to write to an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this could be in processing a very long â%sâ format string. Memory leaks can also occur. The first issue may mask the second issue dependent on compiler behaviour. These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data is passed to the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed as command line arguments. Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS sessions by using a server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. Note that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the RSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. This vulnerability is known as DROWN (CVE-2016-0800). Recovering one session key requires the attacker to perform approximately 2^50 computation, as well as thousands of connections to the affected server. A more efficient variant of the DROWN attack exists against unpatched OpenSSL servers using versions that predate 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf released on 19/Mar/2015 (see CVE-2016-0703 below). Users can avoid this issue by disabling the SSLv2 protocol in all their SSL/TLS servers, if theyâve not done so already. Disabling all SSLv2 ciphers is also sufficient, provided the patches for CVE-2015-3197 (fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1r and 1.0.2f) have been deployed. Servers that have not disabled the SSLv2 protocol, and are not patched for CVE-2015-3197 are vulnerable to DROWN even if all SSLv2 ciphers are nominally disabled, because malicious clients can force the use of SSLv2 with EXPORT ciphers. OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s deploy the following mitigation against DROWN: SSLv2 is now by default disabled at build-time. Builds that are not configured with âenable-ssl2â will not support SSLv2. Even if âenable-ssl2â is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the version-flexible SSLv23_method() will need to explicitly call either of: SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2); or SSL_clear_options(ssl, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2); as appropriate. Even if either of those is used, or the application explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2_method() or its client or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search key recovery have been removed. Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available. In addition, weak ciphers in SSLv3 and up are now disabled in default builds of OpenSSL. Builds that are not configured with âenable-weak-ssl-ciphersâ will not provide any âEXPORTâ or âLOWâ strength ciphers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Historically OpenSSL usually only ever generated DH parameters based on âsafeâ primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC 5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be âsafeâ. Where an application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that are not âsafeâ then an attacker could use this fact to find a peerâs private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. For example this could be used to discover a TLS serverâs private DH exponent if itâs reusing the private DH exponent or itâs using a static DH ciphersuite. OpenSSL provides the option SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE for ephemeral DH (DHE) in TLS. It is not on by default. If the option is not set then the server reuses the same private DH exponent for the life of the server process and would be vulnerable to this attack. It is believed that many popular applications do set this option and would therefore not be at risk. OpenSSL before 1.0.2f will reuse the key if: - SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh()/SSL_set_tmp_dh() is used and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not set. - SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used, and both the parameters and the key are set and SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is not used. This is an undocumted feature and parameter files donât contain the key. - Static DH ciphersuites are used. The key is part of the certificate and so it will always reuse it. This is only supported in 1.0.2. It will not reuse the key for DHE ciphers suites if: - SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is set - SSL_CTX_set_tmp_dh_callback()/SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback() is used and the callback does not provide the key, only the parameters. The callback is almost always used like this. Non-safe primes are generated by OpenSSL when using: - genpkey with the dh_rfc5114 option. This will write an X9.42 style file including the prime-order subgroup size âqâ. This is supported since the 1.0.2 version. Older versions canât read files generated in this way. - dhparam with the -dsaparam option. This has always been documented as requiring the single use. The fix for this issue adds an additional check where a âqâ parameter is available (as is the case in X9.42 based parameters). This detects the only known attack, and is the only possible defense for static DH ciphersuites. This could have some performance impact. Additionally the SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE option has been switched on by default and cannot be disabled. This could have some performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. For example this can occur by default in OpenSSL DHE based SSL/TLS ciphersuites.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;X509_cmp_time does not properly check the length of the ASN1_TIME string and can read a few bytes out of bounds. In addition, X509_cmp_time accepts an arbitrary number of fractional seconds in the time string. An attacker can use this to craft malformed certificates and CRLs of various sizes and potentially cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a DoS on applications that verify certificates or CRLs. TLS clients that verify CRLs are affected. TLS clients and servers with client authentication enabled may be affected if they use custom verification callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

This bug occurs at random with a very low probability, and is not known to be exploitable in any way, though its exact impact is difficult to determine. The following has been determined: *) The probability of BN_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms. *) On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1]. *) Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected. *) Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A missing return value check flaw was discovered in OpenSSL, that could possibly cause OpenSSL to call a Kerberos library function with invalid arguments, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference crash in the MIT Kerberos library. In certain configurations, a remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL by requesting Kerberos cipher suites during the TLS handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fix a denial of service flaw in the DTLS implementation. Records are buffered if they arrive with a future epoch to be processed after finishing the corresponding handshake. There is currently no limitation to this buffer allowing an attacker to perform a DOS attack to a DTLS server by sending records with future epochs until there is no memory left.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Google Security Team discovered several functions inside OpenSSL incorrectly checked the result after calling the EVP_VerifyFinal function, allowing a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature rather than as an error. This issue affected the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS. One way to exploit this flaw would be for a remote attacker who is in control of a malicious server or who can use a âman in the middleâ attack to present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The PRNG implementation for the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 1.1.1 does not perform auto-seeding during the FIPS self-test, which generates random data that is more predictable than expected and makes it easier for attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that rely on the randomness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A flaw was found in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() utility function. An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an application that used this function and overrun a buffer with a single byte.

    &lt;p&gt;A flaw in OpenSSL 0.9.6k (only) would cause certain ASN.1 sequences to trigger a large recursion. On platforms such as Windows this large recursion cannot be handled correctly and so the bug causes OpenSSL to crash. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw if they can send arbitrary ASN.1 sequences which would cause OpenSSL to crash. This could be performed for example by sending a client certificate to a SSL/TLS enabled server which is configured to accept them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The SSL and TLS components allowed remote attackers to perform an unauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified Bleichenbacher attack that uses a large number of SSL or TLS connections using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding that caused OpenSSL to leak information regarding the relationship between ciphertext and the associated plaintext, aka the âKlima-Pokorny-Rosa attackâ.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;RSA blinding was not enabled by default, which could allow local and remote attackers to obtain a serverâs private key by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the number of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of different integer multiplication algorithms (âKaratsubaâ and normal).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Artie&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Artie is a real-time streaming platform that moves production data across systems in real-time, with zero maintenance. We make high-volume data replication simple, reliable, and scalable for engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our platform powers mission-critical use cases including fraud and risk monitoring, inventory visibility, customer-facing analytics, and AI workloads. Artie is built for engineers who care about performance, reliability, and operational simplicity — and we’re growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re trusted by teams like ClickUp, Substack, and Alloy, and backed by top-tier investors including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Pathlight Ventures, and the founders of Dropbox and Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring our first in-house recruiter to own and build talent at Artie. This role is your chance to build our team from first principles.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About the Role&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is not a coordination role and not a “run the ATS” job.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You will be responsible for end-to-end recruiting across the company, with a focus on Engineering, Product, Operations, and Design (EPOD). You’ll partner directly with founders and hiring managers, define what “great” looks like for each role, and build the recruiting foundation we scale on top of.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You will also be the internal owner for our external recruiting partners — setting strategy, calibrating quality, and ensuring agencies complement our in-house motion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you view recruiting as a mix of sales, systems thinking, storytelling, and judgment, this role is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a high-trust, high-ownership role, and you’ll have real influence over the shape, culture, and trajectory of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Open Coding Agents: Fast, accessible coding agents that adapt to any repo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;January 27, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ai2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, coding agents have transformed how developers write, test, and maintain software. These systems can debug, refactor, and even submit pull requests—fundamentally changing what software development looks like. Yet despite this progress, most coding agents share the same constraints: they're closed, expensive to train, and difficult to study or adapt to private codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ai2 Open Coding Agents change that. Today we’re releasing not just a collection of strong open coding models, but a training method that makes building your own coding agent for any codebase – for example, your personal codebase or an internal codebase at your organization – remarkably accessible for tasks including code generation, code review, debugging, maintenance, and code explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closed models haven't seen your internal code, so they don't know it—custom data pipelines, internal APIs, specific org conventions, and so on. Training on your private data teaches them, but generating synthetic training data from private codebases that works for agents has been challenging and cost-prohibitive. Our method makes it easy—reproducing the performance of the previously best open-source model costs ~$400 of compute, or up to $12,000 for performance that rivals the best industry models of the same size. This puts the full recipe within reach for labs and small teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resource constraints drove us to maximize efficiency at every stage, from data quality to inference costs to model selection. The result: we match SWE-smith, a synthetic data method, at 57× lower cost and SkyRL, an open-source reinforcement learning (RL) system, at 26× lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first release in our Open Coding Agents family is SERA (Soft-verified Efficient Repository Agents). The strongest – SERA-32B – solves 54.2% of SWE-Bench Verified problems, surpassing prior open-source state-of-the-art coding models of comparable sizes and context lengths while requiring only 40 GPU days (or fewer) to train on a cluster of 2 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs or NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs. SERA models are optimized and compatible with Claude Code out of the box. With our fine-tuning method, you can specialize them to your own codebase including your full engineering stack and conventions quickly and at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We collaborated with NVIDIA to optimize SERA inference for their accelerated infrastructure, ensuring researchers and developers can get the most out of these models in production environments. Early benchmarks are promising: running in BF16 precision on 4xH100 GPUs, SERA achieves approximately 1,950 peak output tokens per second with a 16k context window. At FP8 precision, SERA reaches 3,700 peak output tokens per second—a higher throughput at almost negligible accuracy drop. On next-generation Blackwell 4xB200 systems running in NVFP4, SERA scales further to around 8,600 peak output tokens per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every component of this release is open – models, Claude Code integration, and training recipes – and can be launched with a single line of code, making it easy to use even for those without LLM training experience. We're also releasing state-of-the-art training data so researchers can inspect what worked and push it further, and conduct deep science while avoiding the many stumbling blocks, dead ends, and other roadblocks typical of coding agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One result we're especially excited about: SERA uniquely enables adapting to private datasets like internal codebases, and we see evidence that a smaller, open model can replicate and possibly even exceed the performance of a more capable "teacher" coding agent in these setups. For example, SERA-32B can surpass its 110B parameter teacher (GLM-4.5-Air) on codebases like Django and Sympy after training on just 8,000 samples at a cost of $1,300.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accessible open models can now inherit strong agentic behavior through a simple, reproducible pipeline—no large-scale RL infrastructure or engineering team required. Case in point, SERA was built largely by a single Ai2 researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The challenge: specializing agents to your data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a small to mid-sized business or independent developer, you probably have code that works with customer data in ways no public model has ever seen. Training on that data would help, but generating agent-ready synthetic data from private codebases has been the hard part. The holy grail would be a method that yields state-of-the-art training data for any codebase, with minimal setup and clear evidence that the tuned model is actually learning agentic behavior versus fragile heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tackle this challenge with our new post-training approach that achieves state-of-the-art open-source results on SWE-Bench at a fraction of the typical training costs. Two innovations make it both inexpensive and effective:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Soft-verified generation (SVG). Synthetic training data generation, which is key to training a strong coding agent, is usually done by generating pairs of code examples that have both incorrect and corrected code. From these examples, the coding agent can learn how to transform incorrect code into correct code by generating a patch with line-by-line code changes. Usually, these examples need to be carefully tested to ensure that they’re actually correct. In SVG, our main finding is that patches don’t need to be correct to be helpful for coding. Just like different code can lead to the same, correct solution, with SVG we generate synthetic training data by having patches that are only partially correct. This removes the need to thoroughly test for full correctness, which in turn alleviates the need for complex infrastructure for testing and costly generation of precise examples. We demonstrate that this soft-verified data scales exactly like "hard-verified" training data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scaling with a bug-type menu. To diversify data without becoming bottlenecked on finding real bugs, we draw from a taxonomy of 51 common bug patterns identified in prior analyses. For each function in a repository, we can generate multiple distinct bug-style prompts—so a repo with thousands of functions can yield tens of thousands of varied agentic trajectories at low cost.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High simulated workflow fidelity. A key finding is that high-quality synthetic training data should mirror the workflow of a developer rather than the precise details of correct code. This means correct coding data is less important than data that reflects how a developer works on a problem. Combined with SVG, this insight enables repository training: generating training data for any code repository, making it straightforward to scale synthetic data generation massively.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these innovations mean that if you or your organization has a private codebase, you can use SERA to fine-tune a small model to strong performance on your data—easily and affordably. Instead of designing a complicated RL pipeline and test harness for every new task setting, you generate targeted synthetic data and run a straightforward supervised fine-tuning (SFT) job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;State-of-the-art performance, accessible hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using SERA, we've developed a family of models ranging from 8B to 32B parameters, all built on Qwen3 and trained up to 32K context length with the help of various teacher models. We expect the same recipe to keep improving as we scale to larger backbones and context lengths, but the key point is that the current pipeline is already cheap and feasible for anyone to run, customize, and iterate on today—opening up wide access and endless possibilities for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our efficient technique enabled highly precise science. By keeping costs low, we could systematically disentangle the many factors that have made comparisons between agentic systems unreliable. This rigorous methodology drove rapid iteration, leading us from soft-verified generation to the full SERA approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we align inference conditions for fair comparison, SERA performs competitively with leading open coding agents. At 32K context, SERA-32B achieves 49.5% ± 1.9% on SWE-Bench Verified, comparable to Devstral Small 2 (50.0% ± 1.3%) and GLM-4.5-Air (50.5% ± 1.3%). At 64K context, SERA-32B reaches 54.2% ± 1.4%—competitive with longer-context baselines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong closed-weight coding agents like Devstral Small 2 are an important point of comparison. When we control for key variables, SERA-32B comes close: within ~0.5 points at 32K and ~4.9 points at 64K compared to Devstral Small 2 despite SERA being pure SFT and not trained beyond 32K tokens, both of which disadvantage longer-context evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also explored how teacher strength affects results. GLM-4.6 yields our best numbers, but GLM-4.5-Air gets surprisingly close at lower cost. The gap between teachers becomes most meaningful in higher-compute regimes—suggesting that depending on your budget and target performance, a weaker (and cheaper) teacher can be the better overall choice, especially for early iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To validate our synthetic data generation strategy, we tested repository-specific specialization on Django, SymPy, and Sphinx—the three largest repositories in SWE-Bench. Because these have actual test instances, we can quantify how well specialization works in practice. This serves as a proxy for the downstream use case we care most about: adapting to private codebases that may lack comprehensive tests or follow nonstandard structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are promising. Our specialized models – trained on 8,000 synthetic trajectories per repository – consistently match and often exceed the performance of the 100B+ parameter models we used as teachers. At 32K context, the specialized models achieve 52.23% on Django and 51.11% on SymPy, compared to GLM-4.5-Air's 51.20% and 48.89%. The gains are most pronounced on Django and SymPy, which together account for over 60% of all SWE-Bench problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results highlight two crucial advantages of our method. First, specialization pays off: a 32B model fine-tuned to a specific codebase can match or surpass a 100B+ general-purpose teacher, delivering comparable performance at one-third the size with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and reduced operational costs. Second, simplicity scales: our SFT-only pipeline on an open base model is now competitive with heavily engineered, large-team efforts. Together, these findings lower the barrier to entry for researchers, make results easier to reproduce, and turn agentic coding progress into something the whole community can validate and build on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Built for developers and researchers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our release package includes everything needed to reproduce, test, and build on SERA—a lightweight deployment requiring just two lines of code to launch an inference server. We've also developed a setup script and inference optimizations that make SERA directly compatible with Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key difference from closed-weight systems is our commitment to openness and reproducibility:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We release models, code, all generated agent data, and a full recipe to generate your own data so anyone can reproduce our results or customize them to new domains.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our training pipeline is intentionally simple—standard SFT on trajectories with no custom RL infrastructure needed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The total cost to reproduce performance levels of the best previous open-source result only is roughly $400 on commodity cloud GPUs, more than 25 times cheaper than many existing approaches that require complex distributed setups and still fall short on performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The total cost to reproduce top open-weight models in industry, such as Devstral Small 2, is only $12,000.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe bringing the cost of replicating strong coding agents down to a few hundred dollars will unlock research that simply wasn't possible before. Instead of being limited to a handful of well-funded labs, agentic coding can become a widely accessible practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you're running locally on your hardware, deploying in the cloud, or fine-tuning on your own codebase, SERA delivers practical agentic coding within reach of developers, researchers, and small teams alike.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;FBI Director Kash Patel said Monday that he had opened an investigation into the Signal group text chats that Minnesota residents are using to share information about federal immigration agents’ movements, launching a new front in the Trump administration’s conflict there with potential free speech implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel said in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson that he wanted to know whether any Minnesota residents had put federal agents “in harm’s way” with activities such as sharing agents’ license plate numbers and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You cannot create a scenario that illegally entraps and puts law enforcement in harm’s way,” he said in the interview, which was posted to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The investigation quickly drew skepticism from free speech advocates who said the First Amendment protects members of the public who share legally obtained information, such as the names of federal agents or where they are conducting enforcement operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are legitimate reasons to share such information, including enabling members of the public to observe and document law enforcement activity and to hold officials accountable for misconduct,” Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Given this administration’s poor track record of distinguishing protected speech from criminal conduct, any investigation like this deserves very close scrutiny,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For months, digital tools have been at the center of how people have pushed back against immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota and across the country. The administration’s opponents have used group text chats to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, share photos of suspected ICE vehicles and raise awareness for neighbors. In June, administration officials criticized ICEBlock, an app designed to share information about ICE sightings. Apple removed the app from its app store in October, prompting a lawsuit from the app’s developer alleging the administration unlawfully pressured Apple to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past few days, the group text chats — especially those on the encrypted messaging app Signal — have drawn attention from right-wing media. On Saturday, Cam Higby, a conservative journalist based near Seattle, said in a thread on X that he had “infiltrated” Signal groups from around Minneapolis that he alleged were obstructing law enforcement. His thread, which got 20 million views, focused on how the groups share such information as the license plate numbers of suspected federal vehicles. NBC News has not verified Higby’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel said he got the idea for the investigation from Higby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,” he said. “We immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat — being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country — if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Signal Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates the Signal app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal, which is considered one of the most secure chat apps, is a go-to resource for people concerned about privacy. It is perhaps best known as the app Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used to share sensitive military information last year in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Twin Cities, Signal group chats have been a standard part of toolkits — along with walkie-talkies and whistles — used by activists, parents and neighborhood-watch members who have organized as volunteers to warn families about immigration enforcement activities by relaying real-time information, especially near schools. Patrol volunteers have said that, with more than 3,000 federal immigration agents in Minnesota, they are motivated by a desire to protect parents, children and school staff members who are not U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel did not say which laws he thought Minnesota residents may have violated. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no further information to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement seemed likely to have implications for the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech. Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement officers as they carry out their official responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The ability of everyday citizens to hold government agents to account, by observing them and advocating for change, is what has distinguished the American experiment with democracy from authoritarian regimes around the world,” Abdo said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Unless the FBI has evidence of a crime, and not just evidence of activity the Constitution protects, it should stand down,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel acknowledged in the interview with Johnson that an investigation into group text chats would raise free speech concerns and said the FBI would “balance” the rights guaranteed by the First and Second amendments with what he said were potential violations of federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Now, we will balance the First and Second amendment constantly, but we have to let the community know that we will not tolerate acts of violence and an escalation and a violation of the federal code,” he said. The Second Amendment could be at issue because Alex Pretti, the nurse shot and killed by a federal agent Saturday in Minneapolis, was permitted to carry a gun in public and had one with him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terr, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the government does not get to “balance” the First Amendment against its other interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Constitution takes precedence over any conflicting state or federal law, and over any official’s desire to suppress speech they dislike,” he said in his email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added: “There is a First Amendment exception for speech intended and likely to provoke imminent unlawful action, but that doesn’t apply to just any speech the government claims puts officials in harm’s way. By contrast, if individuals are threatening federal agents or conspiring to physically harm them, that is illegal. But conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a specific crime and a substantial step toward carrying it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Patel also said the FBI had made “substantial progress” in an investigation into groups and people responsible for funding resistance to immigration enforcement. He alleged that the protests and neighborhood monitoring are “not happening organically” but did not immediately provide evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN, we're the co-founders of LemonSlice (try our HN playground here: &lt;/p&gt;https://lemonslice.com/hn&lt;p&gt;). We train interactive avatar video models. Our API lets you upload a photo and immediately jump into a FaceTime-style call with that character. Here's a demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9&lt;p&gt;Chatbots are everywhere and voice AI has taken off, but we believe video avatars will be the most common form factor for conversational AI. Most people would rather watch something than read it. The problem is that generating video in real-time is hard, and overcoming the uncanny valley is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We haven’t broken the uncanny valley yet. Nobody has. But we’re getting close and our photorealistic avatars are currently best-in-class (judge for yourself: https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor). Plus, we're the only avatar model that can do animals and heavily stylized cartoons. Try it: https://lemonslice.com/try/alien. Warning! Talking to this little guy may improve your mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we're releasing our new model* - Lemon Slice 2, a 20B-parameter diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length video at 20fps on a single GPU - and opening up our API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did we get a video diffusion model to run in real-time? There was no single trick, just a lot of them stacked together. The first big change was making our model causal. Standard video diffusion models are bidirectional (they look at frames both before and after the current one), which means you can't stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there it was about fitting everything on one GPU. We switched from full to sliding window attention, which killed our memory bottleneck. We distilled from 40 denoising steps down to just a few - quality degraded less than we feared, especially after using GAN-based distillation (though tuning that adversarial loss to avoid mode collapse was its own adventure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the rest was inference work: modifying RoPE from complex to real (this one was cool!), precision tuning, fusing kernels, a special rolling KV cache, lots of other caching, and more. We kept shaving off milliseconds wherever we could and eventually got to real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set up a guest playground for HN so you can create and talk to characters without logging in: https://lemonslice.com/hn. For those who want to build with our API (we have a new LiveKit integration that we’re pumped about!), grab a coupon code in the HN playground for your first Pro month free ($100 value). See the docs: https://lemonslice.com/docs. Pricing is usage-based at $0.12-0.20/min for video generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Tell us what characters you want to see in the comments and we can make them for you to talk to (e.g. Max Headroom)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*We did a Show HN last year for our V1 model: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785044. It was technically impressive but so bad compared to what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Science shapes nearly every part of daily life—from the medicines we rely on, to the energy that powers our homes, to the systems that keep us safe. But the pace of scientific progress is still constrained by how research is done day to day. While AI has advanced rapidly, much of the everyday work of science still relies on tools that haven’t fundamentally changed in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing Prism, a free, AI-native workspace for scientists to write and collaborate on research, powered by GPT‑5.2. Prism offers unlimited projects and collaborators and is available today to anyone with a ChatGPT personal account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism will be available soon to organizations using ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, and Education plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve begun to see AI accelerate scientific work across domains. Advanced reasoning systems like GPT‑5 are helping push the frontiers of mathematics, accelerating the analysis of human immune-cell experiments, and speeding up experimental iteration in molecular biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re still early, but it’s clear that AI will play a meaningful role in how science advances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, much of the everyday work of research—drafting papers, revising arguments, managing equations and citations, and coordinating with collaborators —remains fragmented across disconnected tools. Researchers often move between editors, PDFs, LaTeX compilers, reference managers, and separate chat interfaces, losing context and interrupting focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism is our first step toward addressing this fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism is a free workspace for scientific writing and collaboration, with GPT‑5.2—our most advanced model for mathematical and scientific reasoning—integrated directly into the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It brings drafting, revision, collaboration, and preparation for publication into a single, cloud-based, LaTeX-native workspace. Rather than operating as a separate tool alongside the writing process, GPT‑5.2 works within the project itself—with access to the structure of the paper, equations, references, and surrounding context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism builds on the foundation of Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform that OpenAI acquired and has since evolved into Prism as a unified product. This allowed us to start with a strong base of a mature writing and collaboration environment, and integrate AI in a way that fits naturally into scientific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Prism, researchers can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chat with GPT‑5.2 Thinking, to explore ideas, test hypotheses, and reason through complex scientific problems in context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Draft and revise papers with the full document as context, including surrounding text, equations, citations, figures, and overall structure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search for and incorporate relevant literature (for example, from arXiv) in the context of the current manuscript, and revise text in light of newly identified related work&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create, refactor, and reason over equations, citations, and figures, with AI that understands how those elements relate across the paper&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turn whiteboard equations or diagrams directly into LaTeX, saving hours of time manipulating graphics pixel-by-pixel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collaborate with co-authors, students, and advisors in real time, with edits, comments, and revisions reflected immediately&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make direct, in-place changes to the document when requested, without copying content between separate editors or chat tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use optional voice-based editing to make simple changes without interrupting writing or review&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientific research is inherently collaborative. Papers are shaped over time by co-authors, students, advisors, and reviewers, often across institutions and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism supports unlimited collaborators, allowing research teams to work together without seat limits or access barriers. Because it’s cloud-based, there’s no local LaTeX installation or environment management required, making it easier for teams to collaborate in a shared workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By reducing version conflicts, manual merging, and mechanical overhead, Prism helps teams spend less time managing files and more time engaging with the substance of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, Prism is designed to expand access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prism is free to use, and anyone with a ChatGPT account can start writing immediately. There are no subscriptions or seat limits. By making high-quality scientific tools easier to adopt and broadly available, we hope to enable more researchers—across institutions, disciplines, and career stages—to participate fully in the scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More powerful AI features will be made available through paid ChatGPT plans over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, AI changed software development forever. In 2026, we expect a comparable shift in science, as AI begins to meaningfully accelerate discovery in several ways, one of which is reducing friction in day-to-day research work. Prism is an early step toward that future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to learn from researchers using Prism today and to continue building toward tools that help science move faster—together. Try Prism for free today at prism.openai.com(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Arm’s Cortex A725 ft. Dell’s Pro Max with GB10&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm’s 7-series cores started out as the company’s highest performance offerings. After Arm introduced the performance oriented X-series, 7-series cores have increasingly moved into a density focused role. Like Intel’s E-Cores, Arm’s 7-series cores today derive their strength from numbers. A hybrid core setup can ideally use density-optimized cores to achieve high multithreaded performance at lower power and area costs than a uniform big-core design. The Cortex A725 is the latest in Arm’s 7-series, and arrives when Arm definitely wants a strong density optimized core. Arm would like SoC makers to license their cores rather than make their own. Arm probably hopes their big+little combination can compare well with Qualcomm’s custom cores. Beyond that, Arm’s efforts to expand into the x86-64 dominated laptop segment would benefit from a good density optimized core too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, I’ll be looking into the Cortex A725 in Nvidia’s GB10. GB10 has ten A725 cores and ten X925 cores split across two clusters, with five of each core type in each. The A725 cores run at 2.8 GHz, while the high performance X925 cores reach 3.9 to 4 GHz. As covered before, one of GB10’s clusters has 8 MB of L3, while the other has 16 MB. GB10 will provide a look at A725’s core architecture, though implementation choices will obviously influence performance. For comparison, I’ll use older cores from Arm’s 7-series line as well as Intel’s recent Skymont E-Core.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A massive thanks to Dell for sending over two of their Pro Max with GB10 for testing. In our testing the Dell Pro Maxs were quite quiet even when under a Linpack load which speaks to Dell’s thermal design keeping the GB10 SoC within reasonable levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cortex A725 is a 5-wide out-of-order core with reordering capacity roughly on par with Intel’s Skylake or AMD’s Zen 2. Its execution engine is therefore large enough to dip deep into the benefits of out-of-order execution, but stops well short of high performance core territory. The core connects to the rest of the system via Arm’s DynamIQ Shared Unit 120 (DSU-120) via 256-bit read and write paths. Arm’s DSU-120 acts as a cluster level interconnect and contains the shared L3 cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Arm tradition, A725 offers a number of configuration options to let implementers fine tune area, power, and performance. These options include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Branch Predictor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cortex A710’s branch predictor already showed capabilities on par with older Intel high performance cores, and A725 inherits that strength. In a test where branch direction correlates with increasingly long random patterns, A725 trades blows with A715 rather than being an overall improvement. With a single branch, latencies start going up once the random pattern exceeds 2048 for a single branch, versus 3072 on A710. With 512 branches in play, both A710 and A725 see higher latencies once the pattern length exceeds 32. However, A725 shows a gradual degradation compared to the abrupt one seen on A710.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm’s 7-series cores historically used branch target buffers (BTBs) with very low cycle count latencies, which helped make up for their low clock speed. A725’s BTB setup is fine on its own, but regresses compared to A710. Each BTB level is smaller compared to A710, and the larger BTB levels are slower too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725’s taken branch performance trades blows with Skymont. Tiny loops favor A725, because Skymont can’t do two taken branches per cycle. Moderate branch counts give Skymont a win, because Intel’s 1024 entry L1 BTB has single cycle latency. Getting a target out of A725’s 512 entry L1 BTB adds a pipeline bubble. Then, both cores have similar cycle count latencies to a 8192 entry L2 BTB. However, that favors Skymont because of its higher clock speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Returns, or branch-with-link instructions in Arm terms, are predicted on A725 using a 16 entry return stack. A call+return pair has a latency of two cycles, so each branch likely executes with single cycle latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In SPEC CPU2017, A725 holds the line in workloads that are easy on the branch predictor while sometimes delivering improvements in difficult tests. 541.leela is the most impressive case. In that workload. A725 manages a 6.61% decrease in mispredicts per instruction compared to Neoverse N2. Neoverse N2 is a close relative of Cortex A710, and was tested here in Azure’s Cobalt 100. A725’s gains are less clear in SPEC CPU2017’s floating point workloads, where it trades blows with Neoverse N2. Still, it’s an overall win for A725 because SPEC’s floating point workloads are less branchy and put more emphasis on core throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing with Skymont is more difficult because there’s no way to match the instruction stream due to ISA differences. It’s safe to say the two cores land in the same ballpark, and both have excellent branch predictors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Instruction Fetch and Decode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the branch predictor has decided where to go, the frontend has to fetch instructions and decode them into the core’s internal format. Arm’s cores decode instructions into macro-operations (MOPs), which can be split further into micro-operations (uOPs) in later pipeline stages. Older Arm cores could cache MOPs in a MOP cache, much like AMD and Intel’s high performance CPUs. A725 drops the MOP cache and relies exclusively on a conventional fetch and decode path for instruction delivery. The fetch and decode path can deliver 5 MOPs per cycle, which can correspond to 6 instructions if the frontend can fuse a pair of instructions into a single MOP. With a stream of NOPs, A725’s frontend delivers five instructions per cycle until test sizes spill out of the 32 entry instruction TLB. Frontend bandwidth then drops to under 2 IPC, and stays there until the test spills out of L3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, A710 could use its MOP cache to hit 10 IPC if each MOP corresponds to a fused instruction pair. That’s easy to see with a stream of NOPs, because A710 can fuse pairs of NOPs into a single MOP. A725’s decoders can no longer fuse pairs of adjacent NOPs, though they still support other fusion cases like CMP+branch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm’s decision to ditch the MOP cache deserves discussion. I think it was long overdue, because Arm cores already took plenty of measures to mitigate decode costs. Chief among these is a predecode scheme. Instructions are partially decoded when they’re filled into the instruction cache. L1I caches on cores up to the Cortex A78 and Cortex X1 stored instructions in a 36 or 40-bit intermediate format. It’s a compromise between area-hungry micro-op caching and fully decoding instructions with every fetch. Combining predecode and micro-op caching is overkill, especially on low clocked cores where timing should be easier. Seeing A710 hit ridiculous throughput in an instruction bandwidth microbenchmark was fun, but it’s a corner case. Arm likely determined that the core rarely encountered more than one instruction fusion candidate per cycle, and I suspect they’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725’s Technical Reference Manual suggests Arm uses a different predecode scheme now, with 5 bits of “sideband” predecode data stored alongside each 32-bit aarch64 instruction. Sideband bit patterns indicate a valid opcode. Older Arm CPUs used the intermediate format to deal with the large and non-contiguous undefined instruction space. A725’s sideband bits likely cover the same purpose, along with aiding the decoders for valid instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rename and Allocate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MOPs from the frontend go to the rename/allocate stage, which can handle five MOPs per cycle. Besides doing classical register renaming to remove false dependencies, modern CPUs can pull a variety of tricks to expose additional parallelism. A725 can recognize moving an immediate value of 0 to a register as a zeroing idiom, and doesn’t need to allocate a physical register to hold that instruction’s result. Move elimination is supported too, though A725 can’t eliminate chained MOVs across all renamer slots like AMD and Intel’s recent cores. In a test with independent MOVs, A725 allocates a physical register for every instruction. Arm’s move elimination possibly fails if the renamer encounters too many MOVs in the same cycle. That’s what happens on Intel’s Haswell, but I couldn’t verify it on A725 because Arm doesn’t have performance events to account for move elimination efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory renaming is another form of move elimination, where the CPU carries out zero-cycle store forwarding if both the load and store use the same address register. Intel first did this on Ice Lake, and AMD first did so on Zen 2. Skymont has memory renaming too. I tested for but didn’t observe memory renaming on A725.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Out-of-Order Execution Engine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm historically took a conservative approach to growing reordering capacity on their 7-series cores. A larger reordering window helps the core run further ahead of a stalled instruction to extract instruction level parallelism. Increasing the reordering window can improve performance, but runs into diminishing returns. A725 gets a significant jump in reorder buffer capacity, from 160 to 224 entries. Reordering capacity is limited by whichever structure fills first, so sizing up other structures is necessary to make the most of the ROB size increase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725 gets a larger integer register file and deeper memory ordering queues, but not all structures get the same treatment. The FP/vector register file has more entries, but has fewer renames available for 128-bit vector results. FP/vector register file entries are likely 64-bit now, compared to 128-bit from before. SVE predicate registers take a slight decrease too. Vector execution tends to be area hungry and only benefits a subset of applications, so Arm seems to be de-prioritizing vector execution to favor density.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Instruction Scheduling and Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725’s execution pipe layout looks a lot like A710’s. Four pipes service integer operations, and are each fed by a 20 entry scheduling queue. Two separate ports handle branches. I didn’t measure an increase in scheduling capacity when mixing branches and integer adds, so the branch ports likely share scheduling queues with the ALU ports. On A710, one of the pipes could only handle multi-cycle operations like madd. That changes with A725, and all four pipes can handle simple, single cycle operations. Integer multiplication remains a strong point in Arm’s 7-series architecture. A725 can complete two integer multiplies per cycle, and achieves two cycle latency for integer multiplies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two pipes handle floating point and vector operations. Arm has used a pair of mostly symmetrical FP/vector pipes dating back to the Cortex A57. A725 is a very different core, but a dual pipe FPU still looks like a decent balance for a density optimized core. Each FP/vector pipe is fed by a 16 entry scheduling queue, and both share a non-scheduling queue with approximately 23 entries. A single pipe can use up to 18 entries in the non-scheduling queue after its scheduler fills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to A710, A725 shrinks the FP scheduling queues and compensates with a larger non-scheduling queue. A non-scheduling queue is simpler than a scheduling one because it doesn’t have to check whether operations are ready to execute. It’s simply an in-order queue that sends MOPs to the scheduler when entries free up. A725 can’t examine as many FP/vector MOPs for execution ready-ness as A710 can, but retains similar ability to look past FP/vector operations in the instruction stream to find other independent operations. Re-balancing entries between the schedulers and non-scheduling queue is likely a power and area optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Load/Store&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725 has a triple AGU pipe setup for memory address calculation, and seems to feed each pipe with a 16 entry scheduling queue. All three AGUs can handle loads, and two of them can handle stores. Indexed addressing carries no latency penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Addresses from the AGU pipes head to the load/store unit, which ensures proper ordering for memory operations and carries out address translation to support virtual memory. Like prior Arm cores, A725 has a fast path for forwarding either half of a 64-bit store to a subsequent 32-bit load. This fast forwarding has 5 cycle latency per dependent store+load pair. Any other alignment gives 11 cycle latency, likely with the CPU blocking the load until the store can retire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725 is more sensitive to store alignment than A710, and seems to handle stores in 32 byte blocks. Store throughput decreases when crossing a 32B boundary, and takes another hit if the store crosses a 64B boundary as well. A710 takes the same penalty as A725 does at a 64B boundary, and no penalty at a 32B boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Address Translation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm grew the L1 DTLB from 32 entries in A710 to 48 entries in A725, and keeps it fully associative. DTLB coverage thus increases from 128 to 192 KB. Curiously, Arm did the reverse on the instruction side and shrank A710’s 48 entry instruction TLB to 32 entries on A725. Applications typically have larger data footprints than code footprints, so shuffling TLB entries to the data side could help performance. Intel’s Skymont takes the opposite approach, with a 48 entry DTLB and a 128 entry ITLB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725’s L2 TLB has 1536 entries and is 6-way set associative, or can have 1024 entries and be 4-way set associative in a reduced area configuration. The standard option is an upgrade over the 1024 entry 4-way structure in A710, while the area reduced one is no worse. Hitting the L2 TLB adds 5 cycles of latency over a L1 DTLB hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel’s Skymont has a much larger 4096 entry L2 TLB, but A725 can make up some of the difference by tracking multiple 4 KB pages with a single TLB entry. Arm’s Technical Reference Manual describes a “MMU coalescing” setting that can be toggled via a control register. The register lists “8x32” and “4x2048” modes, but Arm doesn’t go into further detail about what they mean. Arm is most likely doing something similar to AMD’s “page smashing”. Cores in AMD’s Zen line can “smash” together pages that are consecutive in virtual and physical address spaces and have the same attributes. “Smashed” pages act like larger pages and opportunistically extend TLB coverage, while letting the CPU retain the flexibility and compatibility benefits of a smaller page size. “8x32” likely means A725 can combine eight consecutive 4 KB pages to let a TLB entry cover 32 KB. For comparison, AMD’s Zen 5 can combine four consecutive 4 KB pages to cover 16 KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Core-Private Caching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725 has a 64 KB 4-way set associative data cache. It’s divided into 16 banks to service multiple accesses, and achieves 4 cycle load-to-use latency. The L1D uses a pseudo-LRU replacement scheme, and like the L1D on many other CPUs, is virtually indexed and physically tagged (VIPT). Bandwidth-wise, the L1D can service three loads per cycle, all of which can be 128-bit vector loads. Stores go through at two per cycle. Curiously, Arm’s Technical Reference Manual says the L1D has four 64-bit write paths. However, sustaining four store instructions per cycle would be impossible with only two store AGUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The L2 cache is 8-way set associative, and has two banks. Nvidia selected the 512 KB option, which is the largest size that supports 9 cycle latency. Going to 1 MB would bump latency to 10 cycles, which is still quite good. Because L2 misses incur high latency costs, Arm uses a more sophisticated “dynamic biased” cache replacement policy. L2 bandwidth can reach 32 bytes per cycle, but curiously not with read accesses. With either a read-modify-write or write-only access pattern, A725 can sustain 32 bytes per cycle out to L3 sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm’s optimization guide details A725’s cache performance characteristics. Latencies beyond L2 rely on assumptions that don’t match GB10’s design, but the figures do emphasize the expensive nature of core to core transfers. Reaching out to another core incurs a significant penalty at the DSU compared to getting data from L3, and takes several times longer than hitting in core-private caches. Another interesting detail is that hitting in a peer core’s L2 gives better latency than hitting in its L1. A725’s L2 is strictly inclusive of L1D contents, which means L2 tags could be used as a snoop filter for the L1D. Arm’s figures suggest the core first checks L2 when it receives a snoop, and only probes L1D after a L2 hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Performance: SPEC CPU2017&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725’s SPEC CPU2017 performance brackets Intel’s Crestmont as tested in their Meteor Lake mobile design. Neoverse N2 scores slightly higher. Core performance is heavily dependent on how it’s implemented, and low clock speeds in GB10’s implementation mean its A725 cores struggle to climb past older density optimized designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clock speed tends to heavily influence core-bound bound workloads. 548.exchange2 is one example. Excellent core-private cache hitrates mean IPC (instructions per cycle) doesn’t change with clock speed. A725 manages a 10.9% IPC increase over Neoverse N2, showing that Arm has improved their core architecture. However, Neoverse N2’s 3.4 GHz clock speed translates to a 17% performance advantage over A725. Crestmont presents a more difficult comparison because of different executed instruction counts. 548.exchange2 executed 1.93 trillion instructions on the x86-64 cores, but required 2.12 trillion on aarch64 cores. A725 still achieves higher clock normalized performance, but Cresmont’s 3.8 GHz clock speed puts it 14.5% ahead. Other high IPC, core bound workloads show a similar trend. Crestmont chokes on something in 538.imagick though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, clock speed means little in workloads that suffer a lot of last level cache misses. DRAM doesn’t keep pace with clock speed increases, meaning that IPC gets lower as clock speed gets higher. A725 remains very competitive in those workloads despite its lower clock speed. In 520.omnetpp, it matches the Neoverse N2 and takes a 20% lead over Crestmont. A725 even gets close to Skymont’s performance in 549.fotonik3d.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A725 only gains entries in the most important out-of-order structures compared to A710. Elsewhere, Arm preferred to rebalance resources, or even cut back on them. It’s impressive to see Arm trim the fat on a core that didn’t have a lot of fat to begin with, and it’s hard to argue with the results. A725’s architecture looks like an overall upgrade over A710 and Neoverse N2. I suspect A725 would come out top if both ran at the same clock speeds and were supported by identical memory subsystems. In GB10 though, A725’s cores don’t clock high enough to beat older designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm’s core design and Nvidia’s implementation choices contrast with AMD and Intel’s density optimized strategies. Intel’s Skymont is almost a P-Core, and only makes concessions in the most power and area hungry features like vector execution. AMD takes their high performance architecture and targets lower clock speeds, taking whatever density gains they can get in the process. Now that Arm’s cores are moving into higher performance devices like Nvidia’s GB10, it’ll be interesting to see how their density-optimized strategy plays out against Intel and AMD’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, a massive thank you to Dell for sending over the two Pro Max with GB10s for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This essay is excerpted from culture writer Chuck Klosterman’s new book, “Football.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Television defined the last half of the twentieth century, outperforming all other mass media combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was already understood by the onset of the 1970s, prompting countless network executives to kill themselves in the hope of creating something impeccably suited for sitting in front of an electromagnetic box and remaining there for as long as possible. This typically entailed thoughtful consideration over the content of TV: what a program was about, how it was written, and what personalities were involved. But what’s even more critical, and far harder to manufacture, is the form of the program: the pacing, the visual construction, and the way the watcher experiences whatever they happen to be watching. How a person thinks about television is a manifestation of its content; how a person feels about television is a manifestation of its form. And there’s simply never been a TV product more formally successful than televised football. This was an accident. But it turns out you can’t design something on purpose that’s superior to the way televised football naturally occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Football is a purely mediated experience, even when there is no media involved. It’s not just that you can see a game better when you watch it on television. Television is the only way you can see it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realize I’m making an aesthetic argument many will not accept, particularly if they start from the position that football games are boring, meaningless, or both. The merits of televised football as a formal spectacle are immaterial to someone who hates the thing being televised, in the same way the harmonic simplicity of Miles Davis is immaterial to someone who hates jazz. Appreciating the TV experience of football requires some casual interest in the game itself. But what makes the TV experience of football so remarkable is how “casual interest” is more than enough to generate an illogically deep level of satisfaction. The way football is broadcast manages to obliterate any difference between an informal consumer and a face-painting fanatic. This is due to many factors, the most critical being that football is always, always, always better on television than it is in person. The televised experience is so superior to the in‑person experience that most people watching a football game live are mentally converting what they’re seeing into its TV equivalent, without even trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only sport universally understood to be better when watched in person is hockey. In the same way football is always better on TV, hockey is always better live. With almost every other sport, the difference is debatable. Baseball is sometimes better in person, because it’s nice to sit outside in the summer (the weather and the park have more influence than the game). Basketball becomes more compelling if you sit close to the court and less compelling if you’re in the rafters, though the prime seats in any NBA arena tend to provide ticket holders with the same viewpoint they’d get from a TV broadcast. Live tennis and live golf offer details that can’t be captured on television, but there are rules of decorum and big potential for monotony. Soccer is exclusively about atmosphere and identity, so the experience of being in the crowd and the experience of the game itself are only nominally associated, in the same way going to see the Grateful Dead in the late 1980s was only nominally about music. Live boxing and live auto racing deliver palpable electricity with subpar sightlines. In all of these non‑football examples, the debate boils down to how effectively the televised depiction of an event can translate its in‑person actuality, which is why hockey is an outlier (the ambient feeling of bodies colliding with plexiglass is not digitally transferrable). Televised football is an outlier to an even greater extent, and for a much stranger reason: The TV experience doesn’t translate the live experience at all, in any way. The game happening in the physical world only exists to facilitate the broadcast version of the game, even if the game is not being televised. Here again, it must be reiterated: Football is a purely mediated experience, even when there is no media involved. It’s not just that you can see a game better when you watch it on television. Television is the only way you can see it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Times’ sports reporting staff selects their favorite story from 2025, a showcase of stories that hold a special place with 17 writers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With football, the psychology of fascism works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Football fans attend football games for lots of different reasons. However, one of the expressed reasons can never be “A desire to see what’s really happening.” If that was someone’s true desire, they would stay home and watch it on TV. No one inside a football stadium — including the coaches on the sideline and the players on the field— can see the game with the consistent clarity of a person watching remotely. The announcers have the game happening directly in front of them and still watch the action on TV monitors, in part because they want their commentary to match what the home viewer is seeing but mostly because the camera is the perspective that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even when there is no camera, our minds insert one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now, it’s difficult to find any football game that isn’t being filmed by someone. When CBS broadcast Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, the network utilized 165 cameras. When Super Bowl I was broadcast in 1967 (on two competing networks at the same time), the total number of cameras was 11. This is now unthinkable. Show up at a random Pop Warner football game in rural Idaho, and you might find 22 different parents recording the action on 22 different camera phones. When I played high school football in the 1980s, not even the state championship was broadcast by any local station; today, most regular‑season high school games in every state can be streamed live, sometimes with a multi-camera professionalism on par with the broadcast of Super Bowl I. A camera‑free event has become rarer than the alternative. But the mental phenomenon I’m describing has little to do with how videography has expanded. The mentally inserted “camera” is not a machine. It is a way of seeing. It’s a type of forced perspective, invented by cameras and normalized through the omnipresence of television. In other realms of existence, such a phenomenon would be bad, since what I’m describing is a kind of psychological fascism. It is, technically, a form of mind control. Yet in this one particular instance, it benefits both the sport and the audience. With football, the psychology of fascism works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visualize, for a moment, a capacity crowd at Michigan Stadium, the third‑largest sports venue on earth. Imagine the Michigan Wolverines are playing the Ohio State Buckeyes, with 107,601 people in the stands. Those 107,601 people are all seeing the event in a unique way, because every individual seat is in a unique location. All 107,601 sight lines are personal. Throughout the game, the ball moves up and down the field, and — every so often — a play will happen directly in front of a handful of fans coincidentally located in the ideal spot to see the action. Perhaps a woman’s seat is in the tenth row of section 15, located in the westerly corner of the south end zone: If an Ohio State receiver runs a fade pattern and catches the ball over his shoulder in front of the southwest pylon, that ticket holder will witness the reception with an unmatched lucidity. No one else will experience that extemporaneous moment like the woman in that particular seat. However, this solitary play is probably the only time when that will be true. There will be 179 other plays throughout the game, none of which will unequivocally cater to the singular view of this specific woman in this specific location. And what will happen during those other 179 plays is a bypassing of consciousness: The woman will see a play from her unique vantage point and automatically reframe what she saw into the way it would appear on television. She will watch the play from where she is sitting, but she will process the play from the standard TV perspective of a wide‑angle camera stationed in the press box at midfield. What she sees with her eyes will not be what she sees with her mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jahkeem Stewart showed signs of his dominance at age 12, when he was 6-foot-4 and 360 pounds. But the USC freshman learned it takes work to realize his potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But that’s not true,” you say. “That’s not how it is for me.” And maybe it’s not. There are exceptions to everything. Maybe your mind doesn’t work like this. Maybe you’ve attended three football games a week for twenty years without ever owning a television. Maybe your visual relationship with the world is completely authentic and unchanged by technology. I can’t crawl inside your skull and prove you wrong. But this is how it works for most people, including most who insist it does not. The visual imprinting of television is more overpowering than the visual imprinting of life; a TV screen presents an enclosed reality inside the preexisting reality of your house, and that manufactured reality overwrites both your memory and your imagination. Think of the primary setting from an old multi-camera sitcom (Jerry’s apartment on “Seinfeld,” the living room on “The Big Bang Theory,” the bar from “Cheers”). The standard shot of the set is ingrained in your memory and can be instantly recalled, but try to imagine physically entering that set through a different door and meandering around, without referencing the original image and triangulating where everything is supposed to be. Think of a real place or a historical event you’ve only experienced through film (the streets of 1950s San Francisco in “Vertigo,” West Baltimore as depicted on “The Wire,” the invasion of Normandy as seen in “Saving Private Ryan”). How difficult is it to now reimagine these places or events in a manner unlike the fake images you’ve seen only a few times? If you’re still skeptical, try this test: Host a party in your home and prop up your smartphone in an inconspicuous corner. Film 20 minutes of the party while you mingle with various guests. Rewatch that footage once a week for a month. At the end of the month, try to mentally reconstruct interactions from the party that aren’t anywhere on the recording. Try to visualize how the party looked, but from a different angle. You may be alarmed to realize your own unrecorded memories are locked into the perspective of wherever you placed your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But that’s not how football on TV works at all,” you say in response. “Football is seen from multiple angles that constantly shift. A few paragraphs ago, you noted that CBS used 165 different cameras for the Super Bowl. Football is better on TV, but not for the reason you claim. It’s better on television because there isn’t one static view.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It can even be argued that the standard camera view of a TV football game is the worst camera angle available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a valid response, and it might feel true on a moment‑to‑moment basis. A controversial play might be replayed from seven different angles in the span of thirty seconds. It can even be argued that the standard camera view of a TV football game is the worst camera angle available. During the college football playoffs, ESPN’s family of networks will sometimes show the same game on multiple channels, with one channel broadcasting the whole affair from the Skycam camera. This is a remote camera hovering above and behind the line of scrimmage, replicating the perspective one sees in a video game. Coaches call this the “All‑22” view, because all 22 players on the field are simultaneously observable. It’s the camera angle coordinators use for film study, and — when it’s available — it’s the way I prefer to watch football. The Skycam allows the viewer to see how the defense is aligned, to follow pass patterns as they develop, and to (almost) see the game the way it’s seen by the quarterback. In terms of absorbing what’s transpiring, it’s vastly superior to the traditional mid‑ field perspective from the press box. Yet even as I’m watching the Skycam view, I can sense what’s happening inside my brain: I’m unconsciously converting what I see into the classic sideline sight line, even though that’s an inferior shot. I prefer the Skycam, but I understand what I’m seeing through the limited perspective of the most traditional camera angle: a master shot that (a) exclusively fixates on the location of the ball, (b) doesn’t include every involved player, and (c) provides no sense of depth or spacing. It’s an inadequacy that should be a death blow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But like I keep saying: Football is different. These are the flaws that make the magic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TikTok settles just before social media addiction trial to begin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok has reached a settlement to avoid it being involved in a landmark social media addiction trial - a matter of hours before jury selection was due to begin in California.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plaintiff, a 20-year-old woman identified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social media and negatively affected her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The parties are pleased to have reached an amicable resolution of this dispute," the Social Media Victims Law Center said of the TikTok settlement, adding the terms were confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The defendants now include Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Dangerous and addictive algorithms'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The case going to trial marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their products lead to addictive behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what third parties post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other features that affect how people use their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the case will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are suffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media platforms foist on unsuspecting kids," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These companies are going to have to explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an existential threat to the social media companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell that idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really designed to answer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'The tech industry has been given deferential treatment'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At trial, jurors are expected to see an array of evidence, including excerpts from internal company documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A lot of what these companies have been trying to shield from the public is likely going to be aired in court," said Mary Graw Leary, a law professor at Catholic University of America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta says it has introduced dozens of tools to support a safer environment for teens online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously questioned the effectiveness of Meta's safety interventions - Meta argued the researchers had not properly understood how the tools it had introduced worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One highly-anticipated witness the jury will hear from is Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who is due to testify early in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, he told US senators "the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During that same hearing, at the prodding of one senator, Zuckerberg apologised to victims and their loved ones who had crowded into the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech executives "are often not good under pressure" said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She said the firms were "very much much hoping" they could avoid having top bosses testify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trial comes as the companies face growing scrutiny from families, school districts, and prosecutors worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, dozens of US states sued Meta, alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and had contributed to a youth mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australia has enacted a social media ban on under-16s, and the UK signalled in January it may follow.&lt;/p&gt;
