    &lt;p&gt;I’m the person my friends and family come to for computer-related help. (Maybe you, gentle reader, can relate.) This experience has taught me which computing tasks are frustrating for normal people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normal people often struggle with converting video. They will need to watch, upload, or otherwise do stuff with a video, but the format will be weird. (Weird, broadly defined, is anything that won’t play in QuickTime or upload to Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to recommend Handbrake to them, but the user interface is by and for power users. Opening it makes normal people feel unpleasant feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This problem is rampant in free software. The FOSS world is full of powerful tools that only have a “power user” UI. As a result, people give up. Or worse: they ask people like you and I to do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to make the case to you that you can (and should) solve this kind of problem in a single evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take the example of Magicbrake, a simple front end I built. It hides the power and flexibility of Handbrake. It does only the one thing most people need Handbrake for: taking a weird video file and making it normal. (Normal, for our purposes, means a small MP4 that works just about anywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is exactly one button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fast and uncomplicated thing to do. Unfortunately, the people who have the ability to solve problems like this are often disinclined to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Why would you make Handbrake less powerful on purpose?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What if someone wants a different format?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about [feature/edge case]?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer to all these questions is the same: a person who needs or wants that stuff can use Handbrake. If they don’t need everything Handbrake can do and find it bewildering, they can use this. Everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a bit like obscuring the less-used functions on a TV remote with tape. The functions still exist if you need them, but you’re not required to contend with them just to turn the TV on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People benefit from stuff like this, and I challenge you to make more of it. Opportunities are everywhere. The world is full of media servers normal people can’t set up. Free audio editing software that requires hours of learning to be useful for simple tasks. Network monitoring tools that seem designed to ward off the uninitiated. Great stuff normal people don’t use. All because there’s only one UI, and it’s designed to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;80% of the people only need 20% of the features. Hide the rest from them and you’ll make them more productive and happy. That’s really all it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Skip the individual downloads and get your entire team on Affinity with SSO via a Canva Enterprise or Canva Districts account. Choose an option below to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes, Affinity really is free. That doesn’t mean you’re getting a watered-down version of the app though. You can use every tool in the Pixel, Vector, and Layout studios, plus all of the customization and export features, as much as you want, with no restrictions or payment needed. The app will also receive free updates with new features and improvements added.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’re on a Canva premium plan (Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education), you’ll also be able to unlock Canva’s powerful AI tools within Affinity via the Canva AI Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes. Affinity is now brought to you by Canva, and your Canva account gives you access to Affinity and other Canva products and features.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No. You can access all of Affinity’s vector, layout, and pixel tools for free without a Canva subscription. If you’d like to unlock Canva AI tools within Affinity, however, you will need a premium Canva plan.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a brand-new product that gives you advanced photo editing, graphic design, and page layout tools under one roof. It includes highly requested features such as Image Trace, ePub support, mesh gradients, hatch fills, live glitch filter, as well as custom capabilities that allow you to rearrange panels and combine tools to build your own unique studios. Plus, with a Canva premium plan, you can unlock incredibly powerful AI tools such as Generative Fill, Generative Expand, Generate Image/Vector, and more — directly in Affinity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes. With a Canva premium plan you can unlock Canva AI features in Affinity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No, these are only available to those with Canva premium accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Affinity is currently available on Windows and macOS (iPadOS coming soon!).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’re busy building our iPad version — stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Affinity is optimized for the latest hardware, including Apple silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Absolutely! The new desktop version of Affinity can open all files created in Affinity V2 or V1 apps. However, Affinity V1 and V2 cannot open files that are created or saved in the newer app, Affinity by Canva.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No, it’s the same app, just available on different operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes, you can install Affinity on as many devices as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes! It’s easy to import PSDs, AIs, IDMLs, DWGs, and other file types into Affinity, with structure, layers, and creative intent preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Affinity is available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Bahasa Indonesian, and Turkish. Keep an eye out for more languages coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Get in touch to speak to our team about how your organization can get set up with Affinity, including SSO.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then all you need to do is stay in one of our pre-built studios: Pixel, Vector or Layout. You’ll find all your favorite tools there, plus some new ones. Since it’s all free, just think of the other creative toolsets as an added bonus!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That’s totally fine. Your Affinity V2 license (via Serif) remains valid and Serif will continue to keep activation servers online. But please note that these apps won’t receive future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For the best experience, we recommend using the new Affinity by Canva app.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. The new desktop version of Affinity can open all files created in V2, but older versions (including V2 on iPad) cannot open newer Affinity (.af) files, meaning you won’t be able to work across both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;We don’t have a release date for the new Affinity on iPad yet, so recommend continuing to run V2 independently while you enjoy the new Affinity on desktop.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes. The new Affinity by Canva app will receive free updates and new features over time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You will need to be online to download and activate your license with your free Canva account. From then on, there is no requirement to be online, even with extended offline periods.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;There are some features which do require you to be online, if you choose to use them, such as product help, lessons, stock libraries and integrations with Canva including AI tools.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;We’ll also be releasing new updates and patches regularly, so we recommend connecting from time to time to keep your app up to date, but it's not a requirement of use.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You need a Canva premium plan to unlock all of Canva’s AI features in Affinity. Simply download the Affinity app via our Downloads page and follow the prompts once you click ‘Canva AI Studio’.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://www.affinity.studio/get-affinity"/><published>2025-10-30T15:54:38+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45762259</id><title>How the cochlea computes (2024)</title><updated>2025-10-31T15:12:36.611345+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="a63e213260f69383"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about how the cochlea computes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tympanic membrane (eardrum) is vibrated by changes in air pressure (sound waves). Bones in the middle ear amplify and send these vibrations to the fluid-filled, snail-shaped cochlea. Vibrations travel through the fluid to the basilar membrane, which remarkably performs frequency separation1: the stiffer, lighter base resonates with high frequency components of the signal, and the more flexible, heavier apex resonates with lower frequencies. Between the two ends, the resonant frequencies decrease logarithmically in space2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hair cells on different parts of the basilar membrane wiggle back and forth at the frequency corresponding to their position on the membrane. But how do wiggling hair cells translate to electrical signals? This mechanoelectrical transduction process feels like it could be from a Dr. Seuss world: springs connected to the ends of hair cells open and close ion channels at the frequency of the vibration, which then cause neurotransmitter release. Bruno calls them “trapdoors”. Here’s a visualization:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the hardware of the ear is well-equipped for frequency analysis. Nerve fibers serve as filters to extract temporal and frequency information about a signal. Below are examples of filters (not necessarily of the ear) shown in the time domain. On the left are filters that are more localized in time, i.e. when a filter is applied to a signal, it is clear when in the signal the corresponding frequency occurred. On the right are filters that have less temporal specificity, but are more uniformly distributed across frequencies compared to the left one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be convenient if the cochlea were doing a Fourier transform, which would fit cleanly into how we often analyze signals in engineering? But no 🙅🏻♀️! A Fourier transform has no explicit temporal precision, and resembles something closer to the waveforms on the right; this is not what the filters in the cochlea look like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can visualize different filtering schemes, or tiling of the time-frequency domain, in the following figure. In the leftmost box, where each rectangle represents a filter, a signal could be represented at a high temporal resolution (similar to left filters above), but without information about its constituent frequencies. On the other end of the spectrum, the Fourier transform performs precise frequency decomposition, but we cannot tell when in the signal that frequency occurred (similar to right filters)3. What the cochlea is actually doing is somewhere between a wavelet and Gabor. At high frequencies, frequency resolution is sacrificed for temporal resolution, and vice versa at low frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would this type of frequency-temporal precision tradeoff be a good representation? One theory, explored in Lewicki 2002, is that these filters are a strategy to reduce the redundancy in the representation of natural sounds. Lewicki performed independent component analysis (ICA) to produce filters maximizing statistical independence, comparing environmental sounds, animal vocalizations, and human speech. The tradeoffs look different for each one, and you can kind of map them to somewhere in the above cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It appears that human speech occupies a distinct time-frequency space. Some speculate that speech evolved to fill a time-frequency space that wasn’t yet occupied by other existing sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To drive the theory home, one that we have been hinting at since the outset: forming ecologically-relevant representations makes sense, as behavior is dependent on the environment. It appears that for audition, as well as other sensory modalities, we are doing this. This is a bit of a teaser for efficient coding, which we will get to soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about some incredible mechanisms that occur at the beginning of the sensory coding process, but it’s truly just the tiny tip of the ice burg. We also glossed over how these computations occur. The next lecture will zoom into the biophysics of computation in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call this tonotopic organization, which is a mapping from frequency to space. This type of organization also exists in the cortex for other senses in addition to audition, such as retinotopy for vision and somatotopy for touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relationship between human pitch perception and frequency is logarithmic. Coincidence? 😮&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could argue we should be comparing to a short-time Fourier transform, but this has resolution issues, and is still not what the cochlea appears to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(a) On MMLU-Pro (4k context length), Kimi Linear achieves 51.0 performance with similar speed as full attention. On RULER (128k context length), it shows Pareto-optimal (84.3), performance and a 3.98x speedup. (b) Kimi Linear achieves 6.3x faster TPOT compared to MLA, offering significant speedups at long sequence lengths (1M tokens).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms traditional full attention methods across various contexts, including long, short, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes. At it's core is Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)—a refined version of Gated DeltaNet that introduces a more efficient gating mechanism to optimize the use of finite-state RNN memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kimi Linear achieves performance, superior and hardware efficiency, especially for long-context tasks. It reduces the need for large KV caches by up 75%, to and boosts decoding throughput by up to &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We open-sourced the KDA kernel FLA,, in and released two versions model checkpoints trained with 5.7T tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Kimi Delta Attention (KDA): A linear attention mechanism that refines the gated delta rule with finegrained gating.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid Architecture: A 3:1 KDA-to-global MLA ratio reduces memory usage while maintaining or surpassing the quality of full attention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Superior Performance: Outperforms full attention in a variety of tasks, long-context, including and RL-style benchmarks on 1.4T token training runs with fair comparisons.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; High Throughput: Achieves up to &lt;math-renderer&gt;$6\times$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;decoding, faster and significantly reduces time per output token (TPOT).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use the Kimi Linear model, we recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language: &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt;= 3.10&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Package: &lt;code&gt;torch&lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt;= 2.6&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Package: &lt;code&gt;fla-core&lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt;= 0.4.0&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install -U fla-core&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example Code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "moonshotai/Kimi-Linear-48B-A3B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quibbler is a critic for your coding agent. It runs in the background and critiques your coding agent's actions, either via hooks or an MCP. When your coding agent is once again failing in the same ways, or ignoring your spec, instead of having to prompt it, the Quibbler agent will automatically observe and correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will also learn rules from your usage, and then enforce them so you don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;demo.mp4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've found Quibbler useful in automatically preventing agents from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fabricating results without running commands&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not running tests or skipping verification steps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not following your coding style and patterns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hallucinating numbers, metrics, or functionality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating new patterns instead of following existing ones&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Making changes that don't align with user intent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quibbler maintains context across reviews, learning your project's patterns and rules over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using uv:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv tool install quibbler&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install quibbler&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quibbler supports two integration modes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Uses Claude Code's hook system for event-driven monitoring&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Passively observes all agent actions (tool use, prompts, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fire-and-forget feedback injection via file writes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More powerful affordances but Claude Code-specific&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Uses the Model Context Protocol for universal compatibility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Agent calls &lt;code&gt;review_code&lt;/code&gt;tool after making changes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Synchronous review with immediate feedback&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple setup via MCP server configuration&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose your mode and follow the appropriate setup instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add Quibbler to your agent's MCP server configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Cursor (&lt;code&gt;.cursor/mcp.json&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quibbler": {
      "command": "quibbler mcp",
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For other MCP-compatible agents: Refer to your agent's documentation for MCP server configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create or update &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt; in your project root to instruct your agent to use Quibbler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## Code Review Process

After making code changes, you MUST call the `review_code` tool from the Quibbler MCP server with:

- `user_instructions`: The exact instructions the user gave you
- `agent_plan`: **A summary of the specific changes you made** (include which files were modified, what was added/changed, and key implementation details)
- `project_path`: The absolute path to this project

Review Quibbler's feedback and address any issues or concerns raised.

### Example

User asks: "Add logging to the API endpoints"

After implementing, call:

review_code(
user_instructions="Add logging to the API endpoints",
agent_plan="""Changes made:

1. Added logger configuration in config/logging.py
2. Updated routes/api.py to log incoming requests and responses
3. Added request_id middleware for tracing
4. Created logs/ directory with .gitignore""",
   project_path="/absolute/path/to/project"
   )&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a terminal, start the Quibbler hook server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
quibbler hook server
# Or specify a custom port:
quibbler hook server 8081&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep this server running in the background. It will receive hook events from Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your project directory, run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;quibbler hook add&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates or updates &lt;code&gt;.claude/settings.json&lt;/code&gt; with the necessary hooks to forward events to the Quibbler server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.claude/settings.json&lt;/code&gt; should now contain hooks that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forward tool use events to Quibbler (&lt;code&gt;quibbler hook forward&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display Quibbler feedback to the agent (&lt;code&gt;quibbler hook notify&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Claude Code runs in this project, Quibbler will automatically observe and intervene when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, Quibbler uses Claude Haiku 4.5 for speed. You can change this by creating or editing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global config (&lt;code&gt;~/.quibbler/config.json&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project-specific config (&lt;code&gt;.quibbler/config.json&lt;/code&gt; in your project):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project-specific config takes precedence over global config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your agent makes code changes, then calls the &lt;code&gt;review_code&lt;/code&gt;tool with user instructions and a summary of changes made&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Quibbler maintains a persistent review agent per project that: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Reviews the completed changes against user intent&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Uses Read tool to examine the actual changed files and existing patterns in your codebase&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Validates claims and checks for hallucinations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Verifies proper testing and verification steps were included&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Quibbler returns feedback or approval synchronously&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your agent addresses any issues found in the review&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude Code triggers hooks on events (tool use, prompt submission, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hook events are forwarded to the Quibbler HTTP server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Quibbler maintains a persistent observer agent per session that: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Passively watches all agent actions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Builds understanding of what the agent is doing&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Intervenes when necessary by writing feedback to &lt;code&gt;.quibbler/{session_id}.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feedback is automatically displayed to the agent via the notify hook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The agent sees the feedback and can adjust its behavior&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both modes build understanding over time, learning your project's patterns and saving rules to &lt;code&gt;.quibbler/rules.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can customize Quibbler's system prompt by editing &lt;code&gt;~/.quibbler/prompt.md&lt;/code&gt;. The default prompt will be created on first run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project-specific rules in &lt;code&gt;.quibbler/rules.md&lt;/code&gt; are automatically loaded and added to the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note for Hook Mode: Quibbler writes feedback to a message file that is intended for the agent to read and act on (though users have oversight and can see it). Your agent's system prompt should include a &lt;code&gt;{message_file}&lt;/code&gt; placeholder to tell Quibbler where to write its feedback. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;When you need to provide feedback to the agent, write it to {message_file}. This is agent-to-agent communication intended for the coding agent to read and act on.&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to leaks from industry insiders such as @Moore’s Law Is Dead and @KeplerL2, “Sound Wave” is manufactured on TSMC’s 3 nm node and aims for a 5 W to 10 W TDP range, positioning it directly against Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite. The chip is expected to power future Microsoft Surface products scheduled for release in 2026. “Sound Wave” reportedly adopts a 2 + 4 hybrid core design, consisting of two performance and four efficiency cores, paired with 4 MB of L3 cache and 16 MB of MALL cache, a memory technology inspired by the “Infinity Cache” used in AMD’s Radeon GPUs. This configuration is relatively uncommon in low-power APUs and aims to improve responsiveness and multitasking under constrained thermal conditions. On the graphics side, the processor integrates four RDNA 3.5 compute units, offering light gaming support and optimized machine learning acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory support is another highlight: the chip integrates a 128-bit LPDDR5X-9600 controller and will reportedly include 16 GB of onboard RAM, aligning with current trends in unified memory designs used in ARM SoCs. Additionally, the APU carries AMD’s fourth-generation AI engine, enabling on-device inference tasks and enhanced efficiency for workloads such as speech recognition, image analysis, and real-time translation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While AMD experimented with ARM over a decade ago through the abandoned “Project Skybridge,” this new effort represents a more mature and strategic approach. With industry interest in efficient, ARM-based computing accelerating, “Sound Wave” could help AMD diversify its portfolio while leveraging its strengths in graphics and AI acceleration. If reports are accurate, the processor will enter production in late 2025, with commercial devices expected the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The cryptography behind electronic passports&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you know that most modern passports are actually embedded devices containing an entire filesystem, access controls, and support for several cryptographic protocols? Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electronic passport basics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in ICAO Doc 9303; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the eMRTD application works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digging into the threat model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read any personal information from that passport&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Figure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movements1&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forge a new passport with inauthentic data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a digital copy of the passport&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) information2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters3. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cryptographic mechanisms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms4. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Legacy cryptography&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control fails&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for oracle attacks that allow tracing by replaying valid terminal responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Forgery prevention: Got it right the first time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key5 can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Modern enhancements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE7, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive8 a password key. Next, the passport encrypts9 a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret10. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyone&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system does with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time11, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider. If you’re implementing ZK proofs of identity documents, contact us to evaluate your design and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is only guaranteed against people that do not know the contents of the passport. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unless you are authorized to do so by the issuing country. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See also this BSI white paper. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is allowed to issue passports that only support the legacy access control mechanism (BAC) until the end of 2026, and issuing passports that support BAC in addition to the latest mechanism is allowed up to the end of 2027. Given that passports can be valid for, e.g., 10 years, this means that this legacy mechanism will stay relevant until the end of 2037. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ICAO Doc 9303 part 12 recommends that these keys are “generated and stored in a highly protected, off-line CA Infrastructure.” Generally, these keys are stored on an HSM in some bunker. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some detractors (e.g., Germany) claim that you could exploit this practice to set up a tracing system where the terminal generates the challenge in a way that proves the passport was at a specific place at a specific time. However, proving that something was signed at a specific time (let alone in a specific place!) is difficult using cryptography, so any system requires you to trust the terminal. If you trust the terminal, you don’t need to rely on the passport’s signature. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes also called Supplemental Access Control ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The key derivation function is either SHA-1 or SHA-256, depending on the length of the key. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The encryption is either 2-key Triple DES or AES 128, 192, or 256 in CBC mode. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The new generator is given by sG+H, where s is the nonce, G is the generator, and H is the shared secret. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The BAC traceability paper from 2010 shows timings for passports from various countries, showing that each has different response times to various queries. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note that this does not prevent malicious parties from creating their own ZK proofs according to the scheme used by the service. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rotate 180°&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Canva makes a bold bet with Affinity: The real money is in the rank-and-file office worker, not the professionals. It just turned the pro tool into the loss leader.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was 20, I remember the huge rub with design software: The stuff you needed to survive as a professional often costs more than a month of rent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, with a reset of its Affinity suite into a free product, Canva appears ready to upend that model entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But let’s take a second to remember just how bad things used to be for entry-level designers. Around the time I graduated from college, a magazine review of the original Adobe Creative Suite put the price of the software at $1,229 (or $2,155 today), which was more than an entry level iBook ($1,099, or $1,927 today). Sure, there was a large educational discount for students like me, but there was a simple reason it cost so much: Because the number of designers was relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, there are more than ever, based on Adobe’s own numbers—as of last year, 37 million people subscribed to Creative Cloud, which is still more than Canva’s 24 million paid users. But the truth is that many of those 37 million people probably don’t need it—they’re subscribed to Creative Cloud through their employer, who likely got a bulk rate on the software. Those people might be editing copy for print, or need to view PDFs, or edit the occasional image or video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if Canva’s North Star isn’t Adobe, but Microsoft Office?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking for a little help in figuring out your approach to productivity? If you’re a Mac user, be sure to give Setapp a try. The service makes available hundreds of apps that can help you get more focused, simplify complex processes, even save a little time—all for one low monthly cost. Learn more at the link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty big splash for a free product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Canva’s bet: Normies outnumber power users by 6X (or more)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explain what I mean: Let’s say you’re a company that subscribes to Adobe Creative Cloud. You might buy it for one department—like your video team, or your web team, or your print team. But there are a lot of other people in your office, and they need design too. They need to build social posts and presentations and email signatures and graphical work that your $150,000-per-year senior designer doesn’t have the time for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Canva is well-suited for those smaller tasks, which is why they’ve convinced 24 million people to pay $120 per year or more for its offering, many in workplaces. Potentially, though, Canva Pro could be nearly as popular as Microsoft 365, which has an estimated 440 million paid subscribers. The pitch to employers: Rather than buying graphics software for one or two departments, everyone gets a Canva Pro subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If only the market wasn’t so split because of all the professionals favoring Creative Cloud and looking down on Canva.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where the make-Affinity-free logic comes into play. For years, Adobe’s Achilles heel has been its overwhelming high cost, which has left many early-career or freelance professional designers feeling sustained sticker shock, year after year. (The generative AI fumble, which still stings a year later, didn’t help.) On top of the fact that it was a huge burden on new businesses, it also discouraged interested designers from dipping their toes in, all because the margin needed to be protected at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With its sights on selling even the accounting team on the value of easy-to-use design software, Canva is betting that by neutralizing the top-end users—the power users who complain a lot—they can get more normies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AI paywall on the new Affinity, as much as I’m already hearing people complain about it, is how they thread the needle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, Affinity’s power users have made it loud and clear that they largely don’t want AI. Fine. But, love it or hate it, it’s basically a given that a big-tech product needs AI in 2025. That’s not because of users—that’s because of Wall Street. (Yes, I hate it too, but that’s what an AI bubble does to people’s brains.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So Affinity’s strategy is to minimize the impact to its product. It combined the AI features that people might not hate—like easier cutouts or resolution upscaling—with the gimmicky generative ones that attract the stock market. That ensures some will buy. For the ones that won’t, they’ll bury it behind a paywall that people can easily ignore; odds are, their bosses (the customers Canva really cares about) will still pay the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At $99.99 per month per user for its Creative Cloud Pro plan, Adobe charges its business customers 6 times as much as Canva, which charges $200/year per user for its business plan. If Canva can get more than 6 normies for every professional Adobe serves, they come out ahead. Plus, it solves another problem, as Affinity CEO Ashley Hewson told Fast Company:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So, how does a free professional tool make business sense for Canva? Adams explains it to me with a simple mantra: “craft and scale.” The high-end, pixel-perfect “craft” happens in Affinity Studio. The “scale”—where that craft is used to generate massive amounts of content—happens in Canva. By making the craft tool free, Canva is betting it can grow the entire design ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The strategy is to build a frictionless bridge between these two worlds. For enterprise teams, this is the endgame. “The high-end designers or the creative team within an enterprise [will be] using Affinity to create all of their brand assets, their templates,” Hewson explains. “But then they upload all of those to Canva seamlessly so the rest of the teams within the business, who are not skilled designers, can scale on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a reflection that everyone is a graphic designer, and Adobe’s attempt to artificially gate the market doesn’t make sense anymore. Oh sure, Adobe has its Express suite, but when’s the last time you heard someone talking about it? Those people talk about Canva.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Canva just flipped 40 years of design-business logic on its head, and if they pull this off, they look like geniuses. If they don’t, hopefully Affinity doesn’t get lost in the shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the software itself, the decision to combine the apps—illustration, pixel editing, and publishing—feels like a stroke of genius. Part of what makes Adobe such a pain to use is that you need to keep flip flopping between apps. With Affinity, there’s no flip or flop. You just load your file and if you want a vector drawing, you add it. Want to place some text or a photo? Just add that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, there isn’t a Linux version. Yes, it is one of the best-running professional-grade apps I’ve ever used with Wine. (This guide helps.) So those quite-vocal Linux users will be happy too, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year and a half ago I wrote an optimistic take on what Canva was doing with Affinity. I think that there is reason to be nervous, but this strategy feels right. Rather than feeling choked by its power users, it’s turned those power users into a loss leader. Usually, it’s the low-end users that are the loss leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Canva knows how to manipulate an image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Well-Designed Links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bending Spoons, the Corel of the cloud-computing age, buys AOL for relatively cheap. Now the reason they suddenly ditched the dial-up makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re at a point where it’s possible to use vibe-code PowerPC apps for MacOS using modern computers for every part except the compiling, as the Mac-centric channel dmg shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently enough people use Samsung Internet, the Samsung-made mobile browser, that it recently got a Windows version with (ugh) AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Update 10/30/2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have seen a few people expressing concern that they could not download the old versions. The links with all past versions of Affinity’s software are still active. I gathered them on Bluesky and Mastodon for folks who need them. Canva (and Serif) should make these more visible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How OpenAI Uses Complex and Circular Deals to Fuel Its Multibillion-Dollar Rise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology. They are also driven, he argues, by new ways of paying for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is always a lot of focus on technological innovation. What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than $13 billion into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying cloud computing power needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than $22 billion for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received $350 million in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a $40 billion investment in OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising $100 billion to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend $300 billion building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these computing facilities over the next several years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly $20 billion data center complex for OpenAI in the Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest $100 billion in OpenAI over the next several years. This could help OpenAI pay for its new data centers. As OpenAI buys or leases specialized chips from Nvidia, Nvidia will pump billions back into OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, OpenAI signed an agreement with AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares in the chipmaker at a penny per share. That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Audio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone has experienced it: After a night of poor sleep, you don’t feel as alert as you should. Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lewis is the senior author of the study, which appears today in Nature Neuroscience. MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang is the lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flushing the brain&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019 study, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow come with the cost of attention loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A unified circuit&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Figures&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the structure of the brain, offers advantages in parallel processing, memory storage, and energy efficiency. However, current semiconductor-based neuromorphic chips require rare-earth materials and costly fabrication processes, whereas neural organoids need complex bioreactor maintenance. In this study, we explored shiitake (Lentinula edodes) fungi as a robust, sustainable alternative, exploiting its adaptive electrical signaling, which is akin to neuronal spiking. We demonstrate fungal computing via mycelial networks interfaced with electrodes, showing that fungal memristors can be grown, trained, and preserved through dehydration, retaining functionality at frequencies up to 5.85 kHz, with an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. Notably, shiitake has exhibited radiation resistance, suggesting its viability for aerospace applications. Our findings show that fungal computers can provide scalable, eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks, bridging bioelectronics and unconventional computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citation: LaRocco J, Tahmina Q, Petreaca R, Simonis J, Hill J (2025) Sustainable memristors from shiitake mycelium for high-frequency bioelectronics.

Recent work has explored natural, biodegradable substrates as sustainable alternatives to conventional inorganic memristors [1]. In this study, we investigated the potential of the edible fungus Lentinula edodes (shiitake mushroom) as a platform for memristor fabrication. By examining the electrical response of mushroom-derived materials under repeated voltage cycling, we explored stable memristive switching behavior, retention, and endurance. Shiitake-based devices not only demonstrate reproducible memory effects, but also highlight the potential for scalable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly neuromorphic components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memristors&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport applications due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural functions. They can enhance various control systems, facilitate efficient information processing, and ultimately improve the overall performance of autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-adaptive in situ learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In memristor-based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance based on previous inputs, allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resembles the synaptic behavior in biological systems [1]. This capability enables robots and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment and adapt in real time, enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. It has been found that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-speed decision-making in dynamic environments [2].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memristors also have the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities into a single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems [3]. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be performed using memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time adjustments to control variables [4]. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to address the challenges posed by separate memory and processing units, which can lead to delays and increased power consumption in traditional control systems [4].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes, and their ability to operate under varying conditions, make them particularly suitable for autonomous applications, such as spacecraft electronics or vehicles operating in unpredictable road environments [4]. This is complemented by the precision in control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining stability and performance while following desired trajectories [5].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in robotics and autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid analog–digital memristor systems can minimize power usage during processing without sacrificing responsiveness, which can prolong operational times by reducing the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement is required, enhancing the feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications [2].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and learning processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous vehicles with functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of memristors to perform complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and integrate both memory and processing into a unified approach make them a cornerstone technology for the future development of intelligent autonomous systems. However, the production of memristors often requires rare-earth minerals and expensive semiconductor foundries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fungal electronics&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process information through their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an ideal candidate for developing sustainable computing systems from. Our aim was to design and implement a novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture that could significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize electronic waste. We approached this using substantially simpler bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural organoids. The unique advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of fungal materials, which distinguish them from typical inorganic or polymer alternatives [6,7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and biodegradable nature. Conventional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-based structures, the production or disposal of which can pose environmental challenges [6,7]. By contrast, fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable and significantly less harmful to the environment. This aligns with increasing efforts toward developing greener electronic materials, as highlighted in previous work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in technology development [8].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The structural composition of fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that can form dynamically under the influence of electrical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments formed in conventional memristors [9,10]. This adaptability can lead to enhanced performance in neuromorphic applications through the facilitation of variable resistance states that mimic synaptic behaviors more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures that can lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale [11].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their unique electrochemical properties. It has been claimed that some organic materials, including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower voltages while maintaining stable switching characteristics––a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for portable electronics and Internet of Things applications [12]. This can significantly extend battery life and reduce energy costs in processing and memory applications, which have become focal points in the research into neuromorphic systems [13].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more naturalistic models for neural networks. Because these materials are subject to biological processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics that resemble biological neuronal networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, enabling applications such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks [14].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fungus types&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential use of common food mushrooms, such as shiitake and button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), as organic memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these fungi [6,7,13]. Memristors, which are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without power, can benefit from the porous structures and electrical properties of the organic materials derived from mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when activated. This porous structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making them suitable candidates for use in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors and, potentially, memristors [15]. Highly conductive carbon materials have been created from shiitake, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive behavior [16]. Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to its unique structural properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated that their porosity can be exploited to create materials with large surface areas, which are essential for the development of efficient electronic components [17]. The synthesis of carbon composites from button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability to function effectively in energy storage applications [17]. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic systems has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices [18].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including their ability to interact with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel sensing technologies. For instance, electronic noses have been developed that use mushroom extracts to detect volatile compounds. These could be adapted for use in electronic devices that require environmental-sensing capabilities [19,20]. This intersection of biology and electronics opens new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Radiation, resistance, and resilience&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability to withstand and possibly derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can be attributed to several biochemical and physiological attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural integrity and exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom’s ability to respond to environmental stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research has suggested that lentinan possesses properties that may help mitigate oxidative stress [21], there have been limited studies directly linking lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, including variable radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research have indicated that certain taxa can enhance their survival through morphological changes or increased melanin production in response to radiation [22]. This radiation resistance implies a suitability of fungal electronics for aerospace applications, where cosmic rays and ambient radiation can interfere with conventional electronics. Fungi’s physical flexibility and low energy requirements would also be advantageous relative to conventional solutions [18,19]. These studies have not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general adaptability observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their nutritional and bioactive qualities after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultraviolet radiation [23]. The high content of ergosterol, a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their potential for beneficial outcomes following exposure to radiation because this compound can be converted into vitamin D2 when subjected to ultraviolet light [24].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, shiitake mushrooms could be considered in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods that could serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as a food source and electrical component emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation. This is especially relevant in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could reduce the risks associated with their increased radiation exposure during missions [22]. Also, shiitake mushrooms can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective compounds, such as lentinan, and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors have contributed to our understanding of their survival strategies and are suggestive of potential applications in areas where radiation exposure is a significant concern, such as aerospace and radiation sensing. By culturing and evaluating the memristive properties of shiitake mushrooms, we can determine their suitability for use as sustainable, low-cost bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methods&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing the memristive behavior of shiitake mycelium involved several steps, the first being culturing the fungi, and then preparing the samples by drying and rehydrating them. Following this, the most successfully cultivated samples were electrically characterized using a test circuit. Additionally, a special circuit was constructed for further evaluating the feasibility of using mycelium for violate memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hyphal cultivation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the financial and environmental constraints of this project, all four evaluated memristors fabricated for our experiments were composed exclusively of low-cost, organic materials. Based on previous research, we identified materials such as biocompatible composites [25,26] as viable candidates for device construction and programming due to their biodegradability and compatibility with fungal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial phase of experimentation focused on the cultivation of fungal hyphae in the selected organic growth media. Nine samples were prepared in standard polycarbonate Petri dishes. The growth conditions were carefully maintained to promote optimal fungal development, with a controlled temperature range of 20–22°C, a relative humidity of 70%, and mixed light exposure to replicate natural terrestrial conditions. The nutrient substrate consisted of a mixture of farro seed, wheat germ, and hay, selected for their organic compositions and ability to support robust fungal growth. Each sample was inoculated with spores or mycelial plugs of shiitake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples (e.g., see Fig 1) were observed and documented biweekly to track their growth consistency and morphological development. Observations including hyphal density, surface coverage, and color changes were recorded in a structured laboratory logbook. In addition to these visual inspections, a brief scratch test was performed to track the progress of the mycelium throughout the substrate. The log included timestamps and qualitative notes, enabling consistent comparison across samples and time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each sample grew a mycelial network that was connected to conventional electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drying and rehydration process&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once full hyphal coverage and structural maturation were achieved (i.e., when the Petri dish was covered), the samples were transitioned to the drying phase. The Petri dishes were left in a well-ventilated area under direct sunlight at room temperature for approximately seven days to ensure uniform dehydration. The samples were rotated periodically to avoid uneven hardening. As previously reported, this process transformed the fungal matrix into a rigid, disk-like structure while retaining its overall shape and connectivity [26,27].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to testing, the samples were rehydrated using a fine mist of aerosolized deionized water. The rehydration was conducted using a standard commercial spray bottle, held within a distance of 10 cm from each sample. This brief rehydration step restored the required level of conductivity without introducing bulk moisture that could have altered their mechanical integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Electrical characterization&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrical testing protocols were designed based on theoretical memristors [6,7]. An alternating current was applied to each sample, and the corresponding current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a digital oscilloscope. As established in previous works, the test setup used a voltage divider to model multiple memristors in the same circuit [6,7].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To extract accurate current values, a known shunt resistor was placed in series with each sample. As shown in Fig 2, voltage readings were captured across both the sample and the resistor, with Channel 1 of the oscilloscope measuring the input voltage and Channel 2 capturing the voltage drop across the shunt resistor. The current values were then calculated using Kirchhoff’s current law, allowing derivation of the I–V characteristics from the voltage differentials. All waveform data were exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format for subsequent digital analysis and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test circuit evaluated the memristive properties of each sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To thoroughly investigate the memristive behavior of the four samples using mycelium coverage density, voltage sweeps were conducted using both square and sinusoidal waveforms. The square waves were employed to detect sharp threshold-based resistance changes, whereas the sinusoidal inputs provided insights into the more subtle, continuous mem-fractive behaviors. This dual approach enabled the identification of hysteresis loops in the I–V curves––a key signature of memristor functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A square wave was used first, with the peak-to-peak voltage starting at 200 mVpp and increasing. If a sinusoidal wave form exhibited more promising results, a broader range of frequencies was explored. The frequencies and voltages used in the initial tests for memristive properties are detailed in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy and error were calculated based on how many reads agreed with the analog threshold, the number of malformed readings, timing jitter, recording instability, and port delays [28].&lt;/p&gt;(1)&lt;p&gt;The accuracy was calculated using Equation 1, where accuracy is a percentage converted from product of correct samples C over the total number of samples N. The standard error SE was calculated for each case, as shown in Equation 2.&lt;/p&gt;(2)&lt;p&gt;A simulated ideal memristive curve was compared against each experimental result, where the statistical distance d was calculated between both curves [28]. The distance was used to compute memristive accuracy at a particular frequency, as shown in Equation 3.&lt;/p&gt;(3)&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Volatile memory testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that the fungal samples exhibited memristive behavior, a specialized electronic circuit was designed and implemented to investigate the volatile memory characteristics of two fungal samples in series. The test circuit was a voltage divider with memory. The test involved setting an arbitrary analog voltage value to represent a high value, and below that threshold was a low value. The frequency range started at 200 Hz and concluded at 5.85 kHz. Similarly to previous work, Fig 3 shows the configuration and layout of this testing circuit [6].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples were evaluated using this model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparably to previous work in memristive computing, the volatile memory circuit employed an Arduino UNO microcontroller development board and a voltage divider consisting of two memristive elements [6,7]. Given the polarized nature of memristors, the circuit was designed to allow a voltage of opposite polarity to that used during read operations to be set. Both voltages used were approximately 5 V. The Arduino UNO cyclically applied a high signal to a relay containing a half-rectified sine wave through one of its digital output pins when reading the memristor bridge, thereby charging the divider. This process induced an asymmetry in resistance, with the memristor closest to the input experiencing a reduction in resistance, while the output-side memristor exhibited an increase. The voltage across the divider was subsequently read using an analog input pin, and another digital pin was used to run 5 V across the divider. The Arduino interpreted the stored state as “on” only when the measured voltage exceeded a predefined threshold, effectively enabling volatile memory detection based on the transient resistance states of the memristors. Ten tests were repeated on each of the four samples. The physical implementation of this circuit is shown in Fig 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volatile memory circuit was implemented using fungal memristors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memristor voltage divider was tested by applying a 5 Vpp sinusoidal signal to the memristors for approximately 0.01–0.1 ms. This signal was delivered via a relay triggered by digital pin 6 of the Arduino UNO. Following this brief stimulation period, the sinusoidal input was disabled, and digital pin 5 was activated to initiate the read phase. Analog voltage measurements were then acquired through the A1 analog input pin. To minimize the effects of floating voltages, a 1 MΩ pull-down resistor was connected to this pin. Voltage readings were recorded for approximately 0.1–0.10 ms before the cycle repeated, allowing for rapid and continuous testing of the memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measurements were transmitted over a serial communication interface at a baud rate of 57,600 and were captured as raw text files for analysis. The data were post-processed and visualized using a custom Python script based on the matplotlib library, enabling clear identification of memory retention patterns and resistance state changes across successive cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general testing setup, based on that used in the literature, is able to indicate memristive behavior in fungal samples. If present, this behavior would manifest as a characteristic pinched hysteresis loop in the I–V curves, typically intersecting at or near the origin––a well-established signature of memristive systems [6,7]. We hypothesized that such a response would emerge under specific combinations of voltage amplitude and input frequency. Where memristive behavior was indicated, volatile memory tests were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungal memristors were tested across a range of voltages, waveforms, and frequencies. Below, we first detail the test inputs used to explore the memristive properties and generate I–V curves. Then we present the voltage and frequency (graphical) test results, followed by the volatile memory test results. Each figure represents the averaged, smoothed results across the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Voltage testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first five tests were conducted to determine which voltage amplitude produced the most favorable memristive response. These initial trials revealed that a 1 Vpp signal yielded the most consistent and measurable results. As outlined in the Methods section, the first four of these tests were performed using a square wave input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Frequency testing&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying 1 Vpp as the optimal input voltage during the initial square wave tests (Tests 1–4), the waveform was switched to a sine wave for further analysis (Tests 5–10). The aim of this phase was to identify the frequency at which memristive behavior––specifically a pinched hysteresis loop––became apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tests 1–5, the voltage amplitude was optimized using square waves. Between Tests 5 and 6, the waveform was changed from square to sine. From Tests 6–10, frequency sweeps were carried out with sine waves to identify memristive crossing. In Test 11, the voltage range was expanded at 10 Hz (5 Vpp) to enhance the response. This revealed behavior close to that of an ideal memristor. Notably, Test 1 had already shown consistent linear behavior, indicating resistive characteristics. The results are shown in Figs 5–13. Fig 14 details a sample noise profile, and Fig 15 summarizes memristive accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 200 mVpp square wave at 200 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 20 Vpp square wave at 200 Hz displaying resistive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp square wave at 200 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 200 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 100 Hz displaying memcapacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 25 Hz displaying memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 50 Hz displaying memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 1 Vpp sine wave at 10 Hz displaying memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a 5 Vpp sine wave at 10 Hz displaying near-ideal memristive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot of a noisy 1 Vpp sine wave at 10 Hz during measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memristive accuracy plotted for Tests 1-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figs 5–10 show the output of Tests 2–7. The frequency was gradually reduced until a crossing near the origin was first observed, as shown in Fig 10. To ensure this result was not an outlier caused by overshooting the ideal frequency, the test was repeated at a slightly higher frequency (50 Hz, Test 8, shown in Fig 11). This confirmed that the optimal response occurred below 25 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As summarized in Table 2, the frequency was decreased to 10 Hz (Test 9, shown in Fig 12), which produced a clear crossing in the I–V curve near the −0.4 V region. To enhance the visibility of this behavior, the voltage was increased to 5 Vpp, which resulted in a more pronounced memristive signature (Test 10). Fig 13 illustrates this result, displaying a nearly ideal pinched hysteresis loop indicative of memristor functionality. The highest accuracy, at 95%, was at a 10 Hz sine wave at 1 V. Fig 14 details the noise from an individual sample. Fig 15 details the average memristive accuracy of each configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Volatile memory experiment&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the volatile memory tests 1 and 2, single read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider. For volatile memory test 3, continuous read and write operations were performed across the memristor voltage divider while the frequency was gradually increased. The primary results are summarized in Table 3. The results are displayed in Figs 16–20. Averaged nemristive accuracy is displayed in Fig 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single write and read over volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another single write and read over volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyclical writing and reading over the fungal volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional cyclical writing and reading over the fungal volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme cyclical writing and reading from volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accuracy for first two tests and cyclic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using low-cost materials, shiitake mushrooms were cultured into ideal memristors. Ideal and non-ideal memristive properties have been observed previously in fungi, but these required far more complex interfacing methods [26]. Although several techniques have been proposed to preserve fungal samples, we obtained experimental validation that dehydration can preserve the observed properties in a previously “programmed” sample [27]. Ideal memristor properties are observed at lower frequencies, but potential latencies can be offset through massive parallelization, as in nature [26,28,29]. As known from previous works on fungal memristors, the mycelial structure contains capacitive, memfractive, and memristive proteins [25,26]. In the memristive tests, accuracy decreased as the frequency increased. The observed rapid switching speed of 5,850 Hz, an accuracy of 90% (± 1%) low energy consumption relative to prior conventional systems, light weight, and radiation resistance all make fungal memristors attractive for edge computing, aerospace, and embedded firmware applications [25–27]. Unlike expensive conventional memristors, culturing fungal memristors does not require large facilities or rare minerals. The process can be scaled to grow large systems, which can be programmed and preserved for long-term use at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study was limited by the relatively short timescale of less than two months. Other researchers have documented memristive properties in mycelial materials, but their studies also focused on short-term performance [26]. Another limitation was that only single, relatively bulky samples were prepared. To truly compete with conventional devices at the microscale and below, memristors will need to be far smaller [7,8,11]. Even in the same growth medium, each sample produced a vastly different culture, and the outcomes have yet to be fully characterized by electrical properties. However, the development of these devices is in an early stage, and they could eventually be miniaturized, especially using improved cultivation techniques. Complications associated with the growth media were not explored, although previous research has found that fungi are quite robust to varying conditions [26].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Future work&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fungal memristors can be produced at low cost, certain aspects of the process could be further optimized. First, consistent cultivation techniques could be improved using three-dimensional (3D)-printed templates and structures that shape the shiitake mushroom into the desired geometry. Second, programming could be facilitated by adding electrical contacts into a 3D-printed cultivation structure. Finally, long-term use would necessitate preservation, which could involve a variety of techniques, including dehydration, desiccation, freeze-drying, certain hydrogels, and special coatings [27]. By testing devices produced to physical stress conditions, a combination of these techniques could enable the development of fast, radiation-resistant, and low-energy memristors grown from low-cost organic materials. The future of computing could be fungal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the fabrication of semiconductor memristors requires rare-earth minerals and large facilities, and culturing delicate neural organoids requires a complex chemical environment to be maintained in a bioreactor. Fungal computing may provide a robust and accessible alternative. Fungal systems have lower power requirements, lighter weights, faster switching speeds, and lower industrial overheads than conventional devices. In this study, fungal memristors were fabricated, programmed, and tested using shiitake mushrooms and conventional electronics. Dehydration-based preservation was successfully explored, demonstrating the robustness of our devices. When used as RAM, our mushroom memristor was able to operate at up to 5,850 Hz at an accuracy of 90 ± 1%. In addition, shiitake mushrooms are biodegradable and have demonstrated radiation resistance, suggesting that the potential applications of fungal computing range from sustainable computing devices to aerospace technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank Ryan Lingo and Rajeev Chhajer of the Honda Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;1.

    &lt;code&gt;gibr alias&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This adds aliases such as &lt;code&gt;git create&lt;/code&gt; so that instead of using the gibr CLI directly, you can use an extended version of git:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git create 123&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above command is equivalent to using the CLI as follows: &lt;code&gt;gibr 123&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;gibr create 123&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flag order when using the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; alias version is different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# ✅ gibr CLI (flags before)
gibr --verbose create 123

# ✅ git alias (flags after)
git create 123 --verbose

# ❌ wrong: flags after gibr CLI
gibr create 123 --verbose 

# ❌ wrong: flags before the alias
git --verbose create 123&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;gibr issues&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;git issues&lt;/code&gt;) to view open issues in the issue tracker you have configured&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;gibr 123&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;gibr create 123&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;git create 123&lt;/code&gt;) to create a branch for the cooresponding issue number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gibr&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;branch_name_format&lt;/code&gt; from your &lt;code&gt;.gibrconfig&lt;/code&gt; to determine the format for the branch.
You can use the following placeholders: &lt;code&gt;{issuetype}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{issue}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{title}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Jira, you can specify a &lt;code&gt;project_key&lt;/code&gt; in your configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[jira]
project_key=FOO&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do this, you can choose to either specify the entire issue id or just the numerical portion (i.e. &lt;code&gt;FOO-123&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Immutable releases are now generally available&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub releases now support immutability, adding a new layer of supply chain security. With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish—and your users consume—remains secure and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About immutable releases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immutable releases offer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immutable assets: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can’t be added, modified, or deleted. This helps protect distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tag protection: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can’t be deleted or moved.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Release attestations: Immutable releases receive signed attestations so you can easily verify the authenticity and integrity of assets, both on GitHub and in external environments.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to enable immutable releases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can enable immutable releases at the repository or organization level in your settings. Once enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All new releases are immutable (i.e., assets are locked and tags are protected).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Existing releases remain mutable unless you republish them.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disabling immutability doesn’t affect releases created while it was enabled. They remain immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Release attestations and verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Release attestations let you verify that an artifact is authentic and unchanged, even outside GitHub. Attestations use the Sigstore bundle format, so you can easily verify releases and assets using the GitHub CLI or integrate with any Sigstore-compatible tooling to automate policy enforcement in your CI/CD pipelines. For instructions on how to verify the integrity of a release, see our docs on verifying the integrity of a release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d love your feedback. Share your thoughts and questions on the GitHub Community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information, see our immutable releases documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rotating Workforce Scheduling in MiniZinc DRAFT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workforce scheduling is a classical optimization problem. Improved schedules can be better both for the workers and for the business, but are often surprisingly hard to find. One common variant of scheduling is called Rotating Workforce Scheduling (shortened as RWS), and is sometimes called cyclic scheduling. In RWS, a weekly schedule is created for a group of workers covering the projected needs. Each worker will rotate through the schedule, working all different weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solving RWS is a challenging problem, both for manual and automatic approaches. This post will describe developing a reasonably realistic variant of finding an RWS schedule using MiniZinc. Starting with the basic structure and then adding more and more typical requirements to get realistic schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is a rotating schedule?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to rotate through a schedule? If there are employees, then different weekly schedules are created. Each employee follows one week-schedule, and every week all employees shift to the next schedule in the rotation. This ensures fairness: everyone eventually experiences each schedule pattern. Using this type of schedule is useful for cases where there is a variety of requirements, usually involving work outside of normal office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post we will keep to a fairly simple model that is still realistic, with D day shifts, E evening shifts, N night shifts, and finally · off days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mon&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Wed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Thu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Fri&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sun&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the week buttons above to see how each employee’s schedule changes as the rotation progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many cases where the scheduling needs are for more detailed levels, not just three types of shifts. Still, this level of detail is often usable, and will allow us to reason about the problem at a simple level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A basic MiniZinc model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we will look at a basic model that handles the data, the instances, and the basic constraints and printing. In the next section, we will add the constraints for the labor rules to turn a basic schedule into something that could be used in practice.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Problem Domain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step in writing a MiniZinc model is to set up the data-definitions. There are three axis that are needed, the days, the employees, and the shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above code, the days are named as an enum. A separate set of days for a weekend is also defined, as that will be needed in some constraints. While &lt;code&gt;{Sat, Sun}&lt;/code&gt; could be used directly in the code it is better to have it named.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enum &lt;code&gt;ShiftsAndOff&lt;/code&gt; represent all the types of shifts (day, evening, and night) as well as off days.
A subset &lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt; is defined from this with just the shifts.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Data and instance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each scheduling problem includes some data that defines the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;employees&lt;/code&gt; integer tells us the number of employees, while the &lt;code&gt;requirements&lt;/code&gt;
matrix tells us the number of people needed for working a shift on each weekday.
In the model the &lt;code&gt;Employees&lt;/code&gt; will correspond to one week schedule each.
The rotation among employees is something that is done with the result of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of employees and the requirements are defined in a data-file. The following data will be used as the running example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Variables and meeting requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important part of defining a constraint programming model is usually deciding on a viewpoint. That means deciding what variables will be used to describe a solution to the problem. Here we will use a straight-forward viewpoint, with a Shift variable for each day and employee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;schedule&lt;/code&gt; array maps each day and employee to a variable shift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some constraints will go over different weeks for more global properties. Since this is rotating workforce scheduling, the first week will follow the last week. The &lt;code&gt;repeated_schedule&lt;/code&gt; array of variables is defined with the first employee’s week
repeated again at the end, unrolled into one single sequence.
This makes it easier to state these rules that have properties that go across weeks.
Note that if any of the constraints were over longer periods than one week,
more than one week would need to be added.
As an example, consider the following unrealistic schedule and
the unrolled repeated schedule where the first row is repeated at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core (and only) constraint for the basic model is that for each day of the week the right number of people needs to work each shift. The &lt;code&gt;global_cardinality&lt;/code&gt; constraint
is made for counting the number of occurences of different values.
In this case, there is one such constraint per day where the count of each of the different shifts scheduled
are set to be at least as much as the requirement, and at most as much as the requirement.
Since not all employees will work in a day, the remaining employees will be scheduled as &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt;,
the only &lt;code&gt;ShiftsAndOff&lt;/code&gt; member that is not limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Solving and printing solutions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only remaining part is to indicate that this is a satisfaction problem and to print a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;solve satisfy;&lt;/code&gt; means that any valid solution is ok, there is no objective to optimize.
The printing function will give a visual example of how the schedule looks like.
Running this model in the MiniZinc IDE version 2.9.4
with the Gecode solver and statistics added gives the following output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This solution can be visualized using the same solution visualizer as above.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution meets the resource requirements, but it is not a usable schedule. Most of the work is in one long chunk without resting days, and there is no consideration for weekends or for how to handle night work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the statistics, we can see that there are 7 propagators, which is one global constraint propagator for each day. The search is backtrack free (no failures), since it is easy to construct the schedule. The solve time is less than a millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the schedule produced with the basic model is not actually usable. In this section, additional rules for schedules will be added one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Consecutive Days Off Each Week&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common requirement in many jurisdictions is that employees should get two consecutive days off each calendar week. This can be added as a constraint for each week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;regular&lt;/code&gt; constraint
was originally introduced in order to handle scheduling patterns3.
The constraint is defined using Finite Automata4,
which can be generated from regular expressions.
Here we are using the MiniZinc version that accepts a string with a regular expression.
These strings can include enum names, and use the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; character for wild-cards and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; for repetitions 0 or more times.
The string &lt;code&gt;".* Off Off .*"&lt;/code&gt; means that the week will start with zero or more days with anything scheduled,
then at some point there will be two &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt; days, then zero or more additional days.
Or in other words, each week contains at least two consecutive &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt; days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running with this constraint gives us a new result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mon&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Wed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Thu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Fri&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sun&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is starting to look a lot more reasonable. Each week has some time off, and therefore the maximum length of time worked is a lot less. The statistics show that there are now some backtracks, but still not very many. The solve time is still in the milliseconds range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Maximum Days Without Rest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that can be seen in the previous solution is that sometimes there are runs where an employee will work for seven days in a row. One common restriction for many areas is to limit the maximum number of days in a row that work is scheduled. Here we will use the limit of 5, so that at most five days in a row are scheduled. Note that while both the previous rule and this rule enforce a certain amount of time off, they are complementary and non-dominating. There are schedules that satisfy one rule but not the other, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to create a set of auxiliary Boolean variables &lt;code&gt;off_days&lt;/code&gt; that indicate if a certain day is an off day.
This is done for the &lt;code&gt;repeated_schedule&lt;/code&gt; in order to not have a schedule with the first five days with work and the last five days in the
last week with work.
The &lt;code&gt;sliding_sum&lt;/code&gt; constraint is used to enforce that
in each consecutive subsequence of a certain length, the sum of values is within a certain range.
Here, in each subsequence of length 6, the sum must be in the range , so there is at least one day that is an off day.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mon&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Wed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Thu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Fri&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sun&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This version of the schedule looks a lot more reasonable just in the shape of working and off days. There is time off every week, and there is never more than 5 days of work. The statistics show that there are now significantly more backtracks, but the solve time is in the tens of milliseconds range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Weekend Rest Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one remaining obvious problem with the off days in the schedule: all the working weekends are clustered. One common rule is that workers will need at least one out of every 3 weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use a similar technique as above with auxiliary variables, but here the variables will represent if a weekend is free. The definition of that is that both the days of the weekend for that employee / row in the schedule has &lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt; in the schedule.
Another &lt;code&gt;sliding_sum&lt;/code&gt; constraint is used for sub-sequences of length 3, ensuring at least one weekend is rest.
One interesting difference is that the constraint is over &lt;code&gt;free_weekend ++ free_weekend&lt;/code&gt; since
this constraint needs to see three weeks at a time and needs selected information for some days.
The &lt;code&gt;repeated_schedule&lt;/code&gt; is not usable here.
It is an unrolled schedule, which would make it harder to extract weekends.
In addition, it would need more than one extra week at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the weekends, this schedule is starting to look ok. The off days are in a decent pattern in general. Looking at the statistics, the number of failures and the time is roughly the same as before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Night Shift Limits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important part left that makes the schedule bad is that there is no consideration for rest around night shifts. Night shifts are taxing and require rest. We will follow a common restriction that night shifts are only allowed when there is rest both before and after. In addition, a maximum of three night shifts in a row are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above (deterministic) finite state automaton represents the allowed transitions between days. Starting in the &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; state, everything is ok the next day.
For day and evening shifts, the next state is the &lt;code&gt;DE&lt;/code&gt; state, where everything except night shifts are ok (with off shifts going back to &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;).
From the &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; state, night shifts can be assigned.
The &lt;code&gt;N1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;N2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;N3&lt;/code&gt; states are used as counters for how many night shifts have been assigned, and after the third one there must be a rest day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state machine can be expressed in MiniZinc as the state transtition table. It goes over the &lt;code&gt;States&lt;/code&gt; and the values, with either the next state or none (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) if there is no transition for that value in that state.
Adding this constraint gives us the following schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mon&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Wed&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Thu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Fri&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sat&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Sun&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This schedule is quite realistic, with typical major scheduling rules taken into consideration. Again using Gecode and the standard search, there are not that many failures and the search time is quite low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarking the model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing a model on just one instance is not that interesting. The model here is an updated version of one that I developed for a poster at Stockholm Optimization Days 2022. For that poster, I generated a benchmark set with employees from 5 to 30, with 10 instances for each size. In total, there are 70 instances. Making a rotating schedule for 30 employees at once is not that common, but it is still useful to measure how different solvers behave at different sizes. For background on how to benchmark a MiniZinc program, see On Benchmarking MiniZinc and the LinkedIn Queens Problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All tests are run using MiniZinc 2.9.4 on a Mac M1 Max with 64 GiB of memory. We will test the following solvers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gecode 6.3.0, a traditional CP solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OR-Tools 9.14, a Lazy Clause Generation portfolio solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chuffed 0.13.2, a Lazy Clasue Generation solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;COIN CBC (2.10.12/1.17.10), an older MIP solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HiGHS (1.1.0), a modern MIP solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Huub 0.1.0, a Lazy Clause Generation solver&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pumpkin 0.1, a Lazy Clause Generation solver&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each solver is run with a time-out of 60 seconds. All solvers are tested both single-threaded and with 10 threads with free search enabled. Note that CBC was excluded from the multi-threaded testing, as it interpreted the time-out to be based on user time and not wall-clock time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For testing, you can download the full MiniZinc model as well as the example instance and the full set of benchmark instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cactus plots 🌵&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the main comparison, we will look at cactus plots. These plots show how many instances can be solved in a cumulative time, with the time plotted on a log scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this plot, we can see that Gecode is quite fast for the simple problems. However, after a while OR-Tools CP-SAT catches up and wins handily. COIN-OR CBC only solved a few instances, so it is not really interesting for this model. HiGHS, as a representative of modern MIP solvers was apart from CBC the slowest solver, although in the end it solved more than Chuffed and single-threaded Gecode. In previous experiments, I’ve seen that the automaton for night shift limits seems to be tricky for MIP solvers. It is interesting to note that Huub, while being quite a new solver, did almost as well as CP-SAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above graph looks at total wall-clock time to run each solver, including translation from MiniZinc. This plot looks instead only at the self-reported solve times from the solvers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main take-away is that Gecode is quite fast for the simple problems, while OR-Tools CP-SAT is slower to get started but better in total. These differences in the starting phase are “hidden” by the common cost of translating from MiniZinc in the wall clock time plot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run time vs number of employees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is natural to think that the run-times will change depending on the number of employees. In this plot, the run-times are summed for each employee count, and plotted. Time-outs are counted as the full 60 seconds, and the opacity of the lines is set by the amount of solved instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this, we can see that above 15 employees, CP-SAT with 10 threads looks like a clear winner. If we instead take the average of solved instances, the view is slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is interesting to note here is that for the instances that are solved Gecode is surprisingly efficient for large instances. This might be a selection effect (only the simple cases are solved), but it might also indicate that the right heuristic could be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OR-Tools CP-SAT version&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As was argued in The Work Task Variation Problem, the development of CP-SAT has made significant improvements. To test this, three older versions of OR-Tools CP-SAT are tested against the current version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.14 (current version, June 2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.12 (February 2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.7 (August, 2023)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;9.3 (March, 2022)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First lets look at the cactus plots&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to see that version 9.14 for this fairly simple problem is slightly slower in the multi-threaded version than the 9.3 and 9.7. At the same time, it is slightly faster in the single-threaded configuration. It is also very similar to version 9.12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the performance based on the number of employees, we can see that although the cactus plot for version 9.7 with 10 threads looked better, the slope is worse. This means that the newer version, while slower in general, seems to be more robust in solving the problem over different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Custom Search Strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the above tests are made with a simple &lt;code&gt;solve satisfy;&lt;/code&gt; statement.
However, it is also possible to specify search annotations in MiniZinc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are more constraints over the weekends than there are over weekdays, and there are also more constraints over night shifts than over day and evening shifts. Therefore, it seems likely that it would be a good idea to assign shifts on weekends first, and to focus on night shifts first. A search specification would look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above code collects all the weekend-days, and asks the solver to assign them in order. By re-mapping the enum values to known integers, we can make sure that night shifts are tried first, then evening and day, and the last to be tested is off days. Note that this annotation is only for some of the days, not the full schedule, the remaining variables will be assigned using the default strategy of the solver.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;D&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="8"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;E&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;·&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this turned out not to be a good idea. Gecode is a traditional CP solver, and as such it gains the most from good search annotations. However, in the below cactus plot and time for different employees, we can see that it is in general worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth experimenting with search heuristics, even if they don’t always pan out. In a previous model for a similar problem a similar idea was good, but here it was worse than the automatic heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above model shows how developing a model for a realistic problem can proceed. It will often not be as straightforward as this, but with the right view-point and a judicious use of extra variables many constraints are often natural to express. Doing the right experiments, and letting the choice of solver be data-driven is also very important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model here is as mentioned for a simplified version of many real-world rotating workforce scheduling problems. There is no optimization, while noramlly the goal is to optimize some parameter of the scheduel. As for the data-model, it is common to not just have a set few different work types but instead to have custom and varied shifts with different start and end times. With that, there will be issues such as the total amount of work per week, resting times between work, ensuring enough rest over an off weekend, and so on. Even more important is to also take into account wishes and requests form the staff. Without their input, it is hard to make a schedule that will be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The model here is partially inspired by the model in “Solver Independent Rotating Workforce Scheduling” by Musliu, Schutt, and Stuckey published at CPAIOR 2018. The specific constraints used are custom, and were originally developed for and published as a poster at Stockholm Optimization Days 2022. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt;are the first elements from&lt;code&gt;ShiftsAndOff&lt;/code&gt;. This means that when defining arrays of matrices that only index on&lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt;, these start at 1, which ensures that there is no extra conversions needed. It would also be possible to define&lt;code&gt;Shifts&lt;/code&gt;as an enum, and then add a new enum&lt;code&gt;enum ShiftsAndOff = S(Shifts) ++ { Off };&lt;/code&gt;, where the Off could go on either side. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The regular constraint was introduced in “A Regular Language Membership Constraint for Finite Sequences of Variables” by Gilles Pesant at CP 2004. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The original paper used Deterministic Finite Automata only, but as I noted in my licentiate thesis, the algorithm works also for Nondeterministic Finite Automata. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equivalently, one could have defined auxiliary variables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;working_days&lt;/code&gt;that are the inverse of&lt;code&gt;off_days&lt;/code&gt;, and used&lt;code&gt;sliding_sum(0, 5, 6, working_days)&lt;/code&gt;to indicate that a maximum of 5 days are spent working in a subsequence of length 6. ↩&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nim version 2.2.6 released&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;31 October 2025 The Nim Team&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains 141 commits, bringing bugfixes and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If youâre still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the version 2.0 release article to see all the features youâre missing. If youâve been using Nim 2.0, the version 2.2 release article shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exception handling combined with Nimâs &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; is more stable than ever before
as the underlying closure iterator transformation has been rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler is now smart enough to produce a move operation for &lt;code&gt;return obj.field&lt;/code&gt;.
Previously it performed a copy.
Expect your code to run slightly faster due to this and other minor performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing Nim 2.2.6&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.6 or install it as described here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have installed a previous version of Nim using &lt;code&gt;choosenim&lt;/code&gt;,
getting Nim 2.2.6 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: We recommend you to install and use the latest version of &lt;code&gt;choosenim&lt;/code&gt;, v.0.8.16, available in our choosenim repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.6 from our nightlies builds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bugfixes&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with the sentiment; I also want to control where things are installed. But the framing of the technical problem here is totally backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operating system or application manager within the operating system (what does flatpak consider itself?) should decide where all application state goes. The application shouldn't ever prompt the user for this, it should just assume a path inside a sandbox. That path inside the sandbox will get mapped to where-ever outside the sandbox, and that's where the user exercises control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already see this pattern emerging with docker images. Everything assumes `/data` is a good place to store things, and `/config` is a good place to read configuration from. I want every application to do this. If I want it to store state, then I'll decide to map those to directories that are persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always chose custom settings when installing anything. Not only you always get to pick target location but often you can avoid installing some additional garbage. I see no problem here though. Maybe i am too used to these things and some people just never learn and click on every button that is presented to them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really depends on the system. In Linux for example it is pretty conventional to ask. But, the asking is often done by querying some environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a program prompts the user for a directory instead of querying the appropriate environment variable, that is a violation of the stated user preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same here. I don't care where the application goes; I care where the data goes. One of my initial annoyances when I started using PlatformIO was that it assumes a default workspace directory and as a new user, it took me forever to figure out where it was putting my files. I have a standard directory structure that I use and this was really messing me up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used a Win10 debloater last year about 2 weeks after install. It deleted Minecraft, which is apparently a UWP too, and it deleted my world, because UWPs apparently store userdata in program directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well the problem with that is that the past few generations of laptops have taken a page from chromebooks and only give you 128GB of storage, maybe 256GB if you're lucky, unless you add more, assuming that's even possible. Storage has never been cheaper, yet most laptops ship with barely enough storage for a base Windows install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am really more annoyed about config files that are cluttering up everything. Even resolve and other big packages started to clutter the Documents folder on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firejail on Linux and Sandboxie on Windows means I can let programs install whenever they want, and I always know it'll be inside some other top-level directory I specify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably better to not let programs spray all over your filesystem anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah yes, because people should be forced to use some random third-party program because developers went out of their way to write their own installer that lacks a feature every standard installer has had since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most annoying instance of this is installers in Windows that just assume you want to go into `C:/Program Files`, which nowadays requires admin to be modified&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very annoying on company machines where you may not have admin, since now there's red tape with your IT because the installer was poorly written&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half the reason I use the WSL is because you at least get "root" on it, so permissions are never an issue&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a feature. You shouldn't be installing software on your work computer. Your IT department should be vetting it, deploying it, and keeping it up-to date for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you can tell the difference between report.pdf and report.exe, but too many people can't, so unfortunately we can't let everyone install anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a Windows environment this can be managed with AppLocker, or an endpoint management solution, or 3rd-Party tool like Threatlocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It becomes less about controlling the users and more about stopping any bad guy dead in their tracks. If nothing but what has been implicitly authorized can execute, then 99% of ransomware attacks will be stopped immediately even after the user clicks the link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your company software procurement process shouldn’t be so onerous that people turn to Shadow IT. You have to work with people where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More options, more mess. The user will always do something funky, then don't remember about it and then complain to the software publisher that it's not working correctly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You do realize that most laptops ship with almost zero storage available on the C: drive, right? You have actually looked at the specs of real hardware in use in the real world, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If software allows changing install location, it should work from everywhere. And there's no excuse for hardcoding Program Files anymore with multiple package managers on windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel your pain as a developer but as a user, sometimes I need the choice. Try to hide it so non-techies people can click Next Next Next but put it in advanced options somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really, the common pattern is to use a well known default and then allow advanced users to modify their install location. Installation location has been a choice for well over 30 years now and a lot of the initial problems ironed out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can you be more specific about which platform you're talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a Mac, I've never wanted an application to go anywhere but the default /Applications. I don't ever recall being asked if I want another location, nor would I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it different on Windows or Linux? And why would you want a different install location?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not the OP, but I do sometimes install macOS applications to ~/Applications. This is especially useful at work where /Application requires elevated permissions. I used to have to request admin rights for a period of time every time VS Code needed do something. In ~/Applications, that’s not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, 90% of macOS apps (outside of the App Store) don’t have installers. You just drag the app where you want it, so it’s a moot point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nix derivation madness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published 2025-10-29 on Farid Zakaria's Blog&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written a bit about Nix and I still face moments where foundational aspects of the package system confounds and surprises me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I hit an issue that stumped me as it break some basic comprehension I had on how Nix works. I wanted to produce the build and runtime graph for the Ruby interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-shell -p ruby

&amp;gt; which ruby
/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9/bin/ruby

&amp;gt; nix-store --query --include-outputs --graph \
  $(nix-store --query --deriver $(which ruby))
error: path '/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv' is not valid

&amp;gt; ls /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
ls: cannot access '/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv':
No such file or directory
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huh. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have Ruby but I don’t seem to have the derivation, &lt;code&gt;24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g&lt;/code&gt;, file present on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No worries, I think I can &lt;code&gt;--realize&lt;/code&gt; it and download it from the NixOS cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-store --realize /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
don't know how to build these paths:
  /nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
error: cannot build missing derivation '/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess the NixOS cache doesn’t seem to have it. 🤷&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This was actually perplexing me at this moment. In fact there are multiple discourse posts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mental model however of Nix though is that I must have first evaluated the derivation (drv) in order to determine the output path to even substitute. How could the NixOS cache not have it present?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this derivation wrong somehow? Nope. This is the derivation Nix believes that produced this Ruby binary from the &lt;code&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt; database. 🤨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; sqlite3 "/nix/var/nix/db/db.sqlite" 
    "select deriver from ValidPaths where path = 
    '/nix/store/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2-ruby-3.3.9'"
/nix/store/24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does the binary cache itself say? Even the cache itself thinks this particular derivation, &lt;code&gt;24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g&lt;/code&gt;, produced this particular Ruby output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; curl -s https://cache.nixos.org/mp4rpz283gw3abvxyb4lbh4vp9pmayp2.narinfo |\
  grep Deriver
Deriver: 24v9wpp393ib1gllip7ic13aycbi704g-ruby-3.3.9.drv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if I try a different command?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix derivation show $(which ruby) | jq -r "keys[0]"
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv

&amp;gt; ls /nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
/nix/store/kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5-ruby-3.3.9.drv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I seem to have a completely different derivation, &lt;code&gt;kmx8kkggm5i2r17s6l67v022jz9gc4c5&lt;/code&gt;, that resulted in the same output which is not what the binary cache announces. WTF? 🫠&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking back to a previous post, I remember touching on modulo fixed-output derivations. Is that what’s going on? Let’s investigate from first principles. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s first create &lt;code&gt;fod.nix&lt;/code&gt; which is our fixed-output derivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let
  system = builtins.currentSystem;
in derivation {
  name = "hello-world-fixed";
  builder = "/bin/sh";
  system = system;
  args = [ "-c" ''
    echo -n "hello world" &amp;gt; "$out"
  '' ];
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";
  outputHash = "b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9";
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;☝️ Since this is a fixed-output derivation (FOD) the produced &lt;code&gt;/nix/store&lt;/code&gt; path will not be affected to changes to the derivation beyond the contents of &lt;code&gt;$out&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/k2wjpwq43685j6vlvaarrfml4gl4196n-hello-world-fixed.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we will create a derivation that uses this FOD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ fodDrv ? import ./fod.nix }:

let
  system = builtins.currentSystem;
in
builtins.derivation {
  name = "uses-fod";
  inherit system;
  builder = "/bin/sh";
  args = [ "-c" ''
    echo ${fodDrv} &amp;gt; $out
    echo "Good bye world" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $out
  '' ];
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/nix/store&lt;/code&gt; for the output for this derivation will change on changes to the derivation except if the derivation path for the FOD changes. This is in fact what makes it “modulo” the fixed-output derivations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85d15y7irq7x4fxv4nc7k1cw2rlfp3ag-uses-fod.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s test this all out by changing our &lt;code&gt;fod.nix&lt;/code&gt; derivation.
Let’s do this by just adding some garbage attribute to the derivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@
   name = "hello-world-fixed";
   builder = "/bin/sh";
   system = system;
+  garbage = 123;
   args = [ "-c" ''
     echo -n "hello world" &amp;gt; "$out"
   '' ];
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate fod.nix
/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build fod.nix
/nix/store/ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1-hello-world-fixed
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The path of the derivation itself, &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt;, has changed but the output path &lt;code&gt;ajk19jb8h5h3lmz20yz6wj9vif18lhp1&lt;/code&gt; remains consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the derivation that leverages it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/85wkdaaq6q08f71xn420v4irll4a8g8v-uses-fod.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/sd12qjak7rlxhdprj10187f9an787lk3-uses-fod
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also got a new derivation path but the output path remained unchanged. 😮&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means changes to fixed-output-derivations didn’t cause new outputs in either derivation but it did create a complete new tree of &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt; files. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means in nixpkgs changes to fixed-output derivations can cause them to have new store paths for their &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt; but result in dependent derivations to have the same output path. If the output path had already been stored in the NixOS cache, then we lose the link between the new &lt;code&gt;.drv&lt;/code&gt; and this output path. 💥&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount of churn that we are creating in derivations was unbeknownst to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can get even weirder! This example came from @ericson2314.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will duplicate the &lt;code&gt;fod.nix&lt;/code&gt; to another file &lt;code&gt;fod2.nix&lt;/code&gt; whose only difference is the value of the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s now use both of these in our derivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ fodDrv ? import ./fod.nix,
  fod2Drv ? import ./fod2.nix
}:
let
  system = builtins.currentSystem;
in
builtins.derivation {
  name = "uses-fod";
  inherit system;
  builder = "/bin/sh";
  args = [ "-c" ''
    echo ${fodDrv} &amp;gt; $out
    echo ${fod2Drv} &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $out
    echo "Good bye world" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $out
  '' ];
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can now instantiate and build this as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix-instantiate uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv

&amp;gt; nix-build uses-fod.nix
/nix/store/211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj-uses-fod
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is weird about that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, let’s take the JSON representation of the derivation and remove one of the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; nix derivation show \
    /nix/store/z6nr2k2hy982fiynyjkvq8dliwbxklwf-uses-fod.drv \

"/nix/store/yimff0d4zr4krwx6cvdiqlin0y6vkis0-hello-world-fixed.drv"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can do this because although there are two input derivations, we know they both produce the same output!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@@ -12,12 +12,6 @@

    &lt;p&gt;Let’s load this modified derivation back into our &lt;code&gt;/nix/store&lt;/code&gt; and build it again!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We got the same output &lt;code&gt;211nlyx2ga7mh5fdk76aggb04y1wsgkj&lt;/code&gt;. Not only do we have a &lt;code&gt;1:N&lt;/code&gt; trait for our output paths to derivations but we can also take certain derivations and completely change them by removing inputs and still get the same output! 😹&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The road to Nix enlightenment is no joke and full of dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re updating how Warp’s paid plans work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are moving to a simpler structure: one single, $20 per month plan, plus usage-based credit reloads and bring-your-own-key (BYOK) for folks who want more AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No bones about it: this plan will be more expensive for some users and less expensive for others. Based on current usage data, over half of Warp users will see their monthly cost go down – or increase by less than $2 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, we are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Introducing a new usage-based plan called Build, which starts at $20 per month with 1,500 credits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deprecating Warp Pro, Turbo, and Lightspeed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updating the Business plan to mirror the Build plan, at $50 per month, including SSO and ZDR controls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By popular demand, supporting BYOK on the Build and Business plans&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decreasing the cost of pay-as-you-go AI credits, which are now ~50% cheaper, roll over month to month, and remain valid for 12 months&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drilling one level deeper, these changes address a couple of issues with our current Pro, Turbo, and Lightspeed plans:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Many users don’t use all the credits they pay for. On the Build plan, you pay for what you use and credits roll over month to month.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The credits that came with our legacy plans were much cheaper than our pay-as-you-go overages, to the point where our overages were eight times more expensive, and users who exhausted their plans felt like overages were a rip-off.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At full usage, the plans didn’t scale sustainably. This problem was getting worse, because folks were finding more and more value from Warp’s AI, using more of their plans, and Warp was losing more money as a result. The new plan sets Warp up to be around for the long term.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We get that there’s a lot of whiplash in the AI devtools pricing market, and sympathize. While we expect some churn from this change, we are trying to do it in as minimally disruptive a way as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For new customers, these changes become effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For existing customers on Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed and Business, these changes will take effect on your first renewal after December 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At that time, your invoice will reflect the new $20 monthly price, you’ll unlock bring-your-own-key, and you’ll receive the new Reload pricing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can also switch over to the Build plan at any time: here’s how. You can find more information on our pricing page.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recorded a short video explaining the thinking behind this pricing update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Build&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re consolidating our paid subscription plans into one usage-based plan, called Build&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Build plan comes with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1,500 AI credits per month which can be used across leading AI models&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bring-your-own API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access to Reload credits with volume-based discounts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unlimited Warp Drive objects and collaboration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Highest codebase indexing limits (up to 40 repositories with 100,000 files each)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bring your own key (BYOK)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BYOK has been a top issue on our GitHub for a long time. Many developers are already paying for OpenAI or Anthropic access and want to use that within Warp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Build plan, you can now add your own key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google models by navigating to Settings &amp;gt; AI in your Warp application. When you add a model, we will use your API key within our top-quality agent harness. You’ll pay model-providers directly for all AI usage. Learn more in our Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, BYOK is not available on the free plan. This is because even with BYOK, it’s not free for us to run our agent harness (it runs on our server), and we provide many other cloud features with variable costs that the paid plan helps us cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worth noting when using your own key:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Warp does not have control over any privacy settings regarding data-retention and training by model providers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Active AI features like prompt suggestions and codebase indexing will continue to work, but will not count against your personal API key usage. We foot the cost of those features ourselves.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reload credits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reload credits are replacing the “pay-as-you-go” overages model previously in Warp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have two options for purchasing more credits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can buy them on-demand&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can enable auto-reload, setting a cap on monthly spend&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In either case, you can choose to purchase credits in increments of $10, $20, $50, and $100. The more credits you buy at once, the cheaper they become.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reload credits are 50% cheaper per thousand credits than the legacy overage credits and much closer in price to the base credits included in Build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reload credits roll-over month-to-month and remain valid for 12 months. When your credit balance renews at the beginning of each billing cycle, Warp will first use your monthly credit balance, before continuing to consume Reload credits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For teams on Reload plans, credits are shared across all members. Team admins can manage when and how credits reload – including enabling auto-reload, setting monthly spend limits, and choosing reload increments directly in Settings &amp;gt; Billing and usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opt in and choose a reload amount when subscribing to Warp Build, or change this at any time in Settings &amp;gt; Billing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Business Plan Updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re updating the Warp Business plan to align with the new pricing structure and make it easier for teams to manage AI usage at scale. The updated Business plan is now $50 per user per month, and includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1,500 monthly AI credits per user (credits are assigned individually and do not roll over)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shared Reload credits that can be purchased and used across your team, roll over month to month, and are valid for 12 months&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bring-your-own API key (BYOK) for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, available for all individual users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single Sign-On (SSO) and universally applied Zero Data Retention (ZDR) for enhanced enterprise-grade security&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Self-serve billing: credit card payments only, with no invoicing or account management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team size limit of up to 50 members per team&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Your feedback matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond aligning Warp’s pricing structure with usage, we’ve been making Warp’s AI requests more efficient: better prompt design, improved conversation segmentation, and smarter tool-calling patterns. We’ve also been investing in AI credit transparency, and recently released some tips for being more credit-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our product is rapidly evolving. Let us know what’s working and what isn’t. We can’t make every request happen right away, but your feedback helps us design what’s next for Warp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When will the new pricing take effect for my account&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For new customers, the new pricing and packaging take effect immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For existing monthly subscribers, changes will apply on your first renewal after December 1, 2025; most likely during the month of December, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For annual subscribers, the new plan and pricing will take effect on your next renewal after December 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What happens to my current plan (Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed)?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will retain your current plan and credits until December 1, 2025. All current Pro, Turbo, and Lightspeed plans will be switched to the new Warp Build plan at renewal. The Build plan includes 1,500 monthly AI credits, Reload credits that roll over for 12 months, and the ability to bring your own API key. For Turbo and Lightspeed users, we will enable auto-reload up to your current plan limit ($50 /$225 respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Will I be paying more on this new plan?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone will have an increased price. Some will pay more. Others with very heavy, or very light AI usage will likely see their costs go down. The new plan is designed to better match what you actually use, so you’ll pay more fairly based on your usage than fixed limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Are there free AI credits available?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, new logged-in users receive 150 AI credits per month for their first two months on the Free plan, and 75 AI credits per month afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I continue to use Warp as my primary terminal?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the Terminal features of Warp will continue to be free to use for developers across Windows, Mac, and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How are Reload credits different from overages?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reload Credits replace overages with a simpler, prepaid system. They’re up to 50% cheaper than the old overage rates, roll over month to month, and remain valid for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also include Warp’s Zero Data Retention protection policy with all contracted LLM providers – no customer AI data is retained, stored, or used for training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Do credits rollover?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For existing users, plan credits on Pro, Turbo, and Lightspeed do not rollover. Neither will pay-as-you-go overage credits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Build plan, credits will not rollover but Reload credits will rollover and be valid for 12 months from the date of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What happens if I’m on an enterprise plan?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no changes to the existing enterprise plans. Our Sales team is ready to help anyone interested in Enterprise plans: please reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I bring my own key on my current plan (Pro, Turbo, Lightspeed)?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, Bring-your-own API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google is only available to users on the Warp Build plan. You can choose to switch your existing plan to Warp Build at any time before your applicable renewal date to access BYOK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How does the monthly spend limit work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your monthly spend limit is the maximum amount you can spend on AI credits within a calendar month. Once you reach that limit, additional purchases won’t be processed until you either increase your limit or select a smaller Reload Credit amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A monthly spend limit only applies if you’ve enabled auto-reload, which automatically purchases Reload Credits whenever your balance is low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Auto-reload settings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New users who enable auto-reload start with a $200 monthly spend - limit by default.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Existing paid plan users who enable auto-reload will have their limit set to match their previous overages spend limit (if configured; otherwise $200).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What about other Warp features? Will those still be accessible?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the rest of Warp’s features remained unchanged. You have unlimited Warp Drive objects, 100K file codebase context, and other terminal and collaborative features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Should I subscribe to the Build plan or the Business plan?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re an individual developer or part of a small team, the Build plan is the best fit. It includes 1,500 monthly AI credits, discounted Reload Credits for additional usage, and the ability to bring your own API key (BYOK) for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google models. You’ll also get unlimited Warp Drive objects, collaboration tools, and the highest codebase indexing limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re part of a larger team (up to 50 members) that needs advanced administrative and security controls, choose the Business plan. It includes everything in Build, plus SSO, enforced Zero Data Retention (ZDR), shared Reload Credits that can be used by all team members, and centralized billing – ideal for organizations that need stronger security, compliance, and team-wide management.&lt;/p&gt;
