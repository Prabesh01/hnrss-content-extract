    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;bidicalc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any normal spreadsheet, when you change values that are the input to some formulas, the outputs are automatically updated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it also work the other way? What if you could also change the output, and have the inputs be updated to match the formula?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few months I've been &lt;del&gt;obsessed&lt;/del&gt; really curious about this idea. But there were so many questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Would it even be possible at all?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Could it work with very complex formulas? With exponents? With advanced math functions like &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;abs()&lt;/code&gt;, etc?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How would the UX work? In a normal spreadsheet, when you click on a cell that has a formula, you get to change the formula's expression. I would need a way to let the user change either the formula's expression or the cell's numeric value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What should happen if there are multiple possible solutions? Like in the example above, if you set &lt;code&gt;A3&lt;/code&gt;to 100, should the result be 50/50, 20/80, -10000/10100? When there is a infinite number of possible solutions, how to pick one?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Could it work with chained formulas? Could I build a long chain of formulas, update the final value and find the matching inputs all the way backwards?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, now let's just skip to the good part! Today I'm happy to introduce:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;User guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Type of cells&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variables&lt;lb/&gt; A simple number entered in a cell is a variable: &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt;. It may be changed by the solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constant&lt;lb/&gt; A number prefixed by a hash &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; is a constant. It will not be changed by the solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text&lt;lb/&gt; Cells can be in text mode. To input text, wrap in double quotes: &lt;code&gt;"Distance (km)"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formula&lt;lb/&gt; Formulas can be entered in a cell (the traditional &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; prefix is optional), for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A1 + A2
A1 + A2*(A3 - A1)^2
exp(A1)
#A1 + H5 * #H6
cos(2*pi())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result of formulas will be automatically updated when an input they depend on changes. This is the usual forward update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The magic of bidicalc is that once a formula has been computed, you can change the result. Bidicalc will walk "upstream" to change variable cells so that the formula's result matches the change you made. This is the backward update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TIP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change a cell formula's expression instead of its result, click on the F icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Supported functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arithmetic operators: addition &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, subtraction&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, multiplication&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, division&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, exponentiation&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqrt(x)&lt;/code&gt;: square root of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pow(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;: exponentiation,&lt;mjx-container&gt;raised to the power of&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pi()&lt;/code&gt;: the&lt;mjx-container&gt;constant&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;abs(x)&lt;/code&gt;: absolute value of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;log(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ln(x)&lt;/code&gt;: natural logarithm of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp(x)&lt;/code&gt;: exponential, the value of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cos(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tan(x)&lt;/code&gt;: cosine / sine / tangent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + &amp;lt;arrows&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate the grid&lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; - Move down&lt;code&gt;Shift-Enter&lt;/code&gt; - Move up&lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; - Move right&lt;code&gt;Shift-Tab&lt;/code&gt; - Move left&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The backwards solver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solver will try its best to find a solution. However it can fail in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This is a bug and should not happen: please report it on GitHub, thank you!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The solver reports "no solution", but there is one. This could be a bug in the solver, or you have found a particularly difficult root finding problem that has solutions that are very difficult to find using floating point arithmetic. Please report it on GitHub so I can use it to improve the solver 😃&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is technically correct but unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This can happen for a large class of problems, typically when there are a lot of free variables (the problem is heavily underdetermined) and the solution manifold is weird. For example, try to solve&lt;code&gt;a*b*c = 1&lt;/code&gt;to see this in action. To combat this, you can:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set some variables to constants using the hash syntax, i.e.: &lt;code&gt;#50&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Reformulate the problem with fewer free variables.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wait for me to implement more features like domain restrictions of variables.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Suggest improvements to the open-source solver on GitHub.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set some variables to constants using the hash syntax, i.e.: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DANGER&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind this is an experiment I made for fun because I like math and spreadsheets. If you need to do root finding to compute the load tolerance of a one milion ton suspended bridge please don't use bidicalc 😄&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How does it work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even a normal spreadsheet is fairly complex beast. But the novel thing about bidicalc is the backwards solver. Mathematically, updating a spreadsheet "backward" is a (potentially underdetermined) root finding problem, because we are trying to find a vector of unknowns &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual root-finding solver is a custom algorithm that I made. It a general purpose algorithm that will find one root of any continuous-almost-everywhere function for which a complete syntactic expression is known. It uses a mix of continuous constraint propagation on interval union arithmetic , directional Newton's method and dichotomic search. It is of course limited by floating point precision and available computation time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bidicalc is written in TypeScript and entirely open-source under the AGPL licence. This means that you can freely reuse, modify, and share bidicalc as long as you make the complete source code of your modified version available under the same licence. If you are interested in buying bidicalc under a different licence please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't taken the time to write a full deep-dive mathematical explanation of how it works, but if you are interested in that please let me know. I might find some time to do it if there is interest from fellow math nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I kept improving bidicalc until it was perfect I would have never released it. So currently it is imperfect and could be improved in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Domain restriction for variables. Currently the solver may assign any value in the interval &lt;mjx-container&gt;. I'd like to add special syntax so that variable cells can be restricted by the user to a specific interval. This would allow guiding the solver and saying that you only want this cell to be positive, of to be between 1 and 100, for example.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solver improvements. The algorithm works well enough for simple problems so I'm happy to publish in this current state, but could always be improved. There are a milion ways to improve it in the future so that it finds better solutions, particularly for highly underdetermined cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;float64 gradients support. Due to a pretty obscure technical limitation of tensorflowjs (that I use to compute gradients), the backward solver is partially limited to single precision, even though the forward solver uses double precision via native JS numbers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UX improvements. I am not very good at front-end dev 😄. I have learned vuejs to be able to make the UX for bidicalc but I'm not great at it. A spreadsheet interface is actually a massive state machine of complex and subtle behavior, it's a very interesting project and tricky to get right. As you can see, I've decided to skip the usual spreadsheet design principle that cells have two selection states: soft selected which enables dragging, selection, etc. and hard selected which enables changing the content of the cell. bidicalc is simply a CSS grid of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;elements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move cell computation off the main thread. The solver is single threaded and happens in the UI thread. It should be moved to a web worker to avoid locking the UI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is the Nicest Thing A Stranger Has Ever Done for You?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So there I was, pedaling my bicycle as fast as I could down a long, straight stretch of road, feeling great. I'd just discovered the pleasures of riding a road bike, and I loved every minute that I could get away. Always a data geek, I tracked my mileage, average speed, heart rate, etc. It was a beautiful Indian summer Sunday afternoon in September. I was in my late 30s, still a baby. Out of nowhere, my chain came off right in the middle of the sprint I was timing. In true masculine fashion, I threw a fit, cursing and hitting the brakes as hard as I could. At this point, I found out that experienced riders don't do that because I flew right over the handlebars, landing on the pavement amid speeding cars. I momentarily lost consciousness, and when I regained my senses, I knew I'd screwed up badly. The pain in my shoulder was nauseating. I couldn't move my arm, and I had to just roll off the road onto the shoulder. I just lay there, hurting, unable to think clearly. Within seconds, it seemed, a man materialized beside me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was exceptionally calm. He didn't ask me if I was OK, since I clearly wasn't. It was obvious that he knew what he was doing. He made certain I could breathe, paused long enough to dial 911, and then started pulling stuff out of a medical bag (WTF?) to clean the extensive road rash I had. In a minute, he asked for my home phone number so he could call my wife to let her know I was going to be riding in an ambulance to the hospital. He told her he was an emergency room doctor who just happened to be right behind me when I crashed. He explained that he would stay with me until the medics arrived and that he would call ahead to make sure one of the doctors on duty would "take good care of me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he hung up, he asked me if I'd heard the conversation. I told him that I had and that I couldn't believe how lucky I was under the circumstances. He agreed. To keep my mind off the pain, he just kept chatting, telling me that because I was arriving by ambulance, I'd be treated immediately. He told me that I'd be getting the "good drugs" to take care of the pain. That sounded awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't remember telling him goodbye. I certainly didn't ask him his name or find out anything about him. He briefed the EMTs when they arrived and stood there until the ambulance doors closed. The ER was indeed ready for me when the ambulance got there. They treated me like a VIP. I got some Dilaudid for the pain, and it was indeed the good stuff. They covered the road rash with Tegaderm and took x-rays, which revealed that I'd torn my collarbone away from my shoulder blade. That was going to require a couple of surgeries and lots of physical therapy. I had a concussion and was glad that I had a helmet on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this happened almost 25 years ago. I've had plenty of other bike wrecks, but that remains the worst one. My daughter is a nurse, and she's like a magnet for car crashes, having stopped multiple times to render aid. She doesn't do it with a smile on her face, though; emergency medicine isn't her gig, and if anyone asks her if she's a doctor, her stock answer is "I'm a YMCA member."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The guy who helped me that day was an absolute angel. I have no idea what I would have done without him. I didn't even have a cell phone at the time. But he was there at a time when I couldn't have needed him any more badly. He helped me and then got in his car and completed his trip. I think of that day often, especially when the American medical system makes me mad, which happens regularly these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed the kindness of a lot of strangers over the years, particularly during the long hike my wife and I did for our honeymoon (2,186 miles) when we hitchhiked to a town in NJ in the rain and got a ride from the first car to pass. Another time, in Connecticut, a man gave us a $100 bill and told us to have a nice dinner at the restaurant atop Mt. Greylock, the highest mountain in Massachusetts. In Virginia, a moth flew into my wife's ear, and I mean all the way into her ear until it was bumping into her eardrum. We hiked several miles to the road and weren't there for a minute before a man stopped and took us to urgent care, 30 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you get down in the dumps, I hope you have some memories like that to look back on, to restore your faith in humanity. There are a lot of really good people in the world.&lt;lb/&gt;Enjoyed it? Please upvote 👇&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Robots designed for the era of AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission is to free humans from physical labor with robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We imagine a future where robots handle the essential, repetitive work and humans are free to create, connect, and pursue what truly matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build that future we’re starting from the ground up with hardware. Our first product is a California-designed and assembled humanoid arm. Surrounding it, we’re developing advanced controls, intuitive data collection, and a full AI stack that makes deployment effortless in real industrial environments. We’re proving it on our own assembly line first.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a complete VR setup from scratch to let rats play DOOM. The system includes a motion-tracked treadmill ball, a panoramic headset, an input trigger, and a reward circuit. All hardware and software components are open sourced, including 3D-printable designs, circuit diagrams, firmware, and control software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version (v1) was built in New York by Viktor, who trained rats to walk through a corridor in DOOM using a simpler rig. That version was featured on Vice and PC Gamer. After moving back home, the project was paused. Public interest reignited development, leading to v2, a more advanced and modular version built in collaboration with electrical engineer Sándor Makra. Akos Blaschek later assisted significantly in documenting the project for open-sourcing, aiming to enable others to replicate and build upon this work. Key metallic components were designed and sourced in collaboration with SZURWIN KFT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic ball setup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rats trained to run forward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal sensors and mechanics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No panoramic screen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New ball driver mechanism for smoother movement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foldable AMOLED screen with 180° horizontal and 80° vertical FOV, Full HD resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded sensors for movement tracking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforced feeder system with mixing motor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modular 3D-printable components&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improved electronics reliability and safety&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reached the point of rat habituation but didn’t start training. Our rats (Todd, Kojima, Gabe) aged out before full testing. The setup works, but behavioral validation is pending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware is a comprehensive VR rig designed for rodents. It consists of a motion-tracked sphere that captures the rat's movements, a custom-built trigger for in-game actions, a curved panoramic screen for visual immersion, and an automated reward system that dispenses sugar water to reinforce behavior. All these components are mounted on a modular aluminum frame, creating a complete, self-contained environment for the rat to interact with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset wraps around the rat’s head with a foldable AMOLED screen. It maximizes immersion without obstructing whisker space. The screen supports Full HD resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset frame also integrates several sensory components: two small air nozzles are positioned near the left and right whiskers, capable of delivering targeted air puffs on command (e.g., signaling wall collisions in-game). The frame provides a secure mounting point for the reward system's dispenser tube, placing it near the rat's mouth. Additionally, the design includes placeholders for miniature speakers near each ear, intended for future implementation of stereo audio cues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Headset&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Movement is captured via a free-spinning ball under the rat. Rotary sensors track displacement and convert it into game motion. The ball can also be driven by motors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These motors are used during training to roll the ball and simulate movement paths before a reward. This guides the rat on where to go, helping form movement-action associations. Like the trigger, this allows for programmatic training sequences with minimal initial input from the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Stand/Ball&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger Input&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shooting input is a custom-built hand-operated lever. Rats pull it with their paws to fire. The lever is held in place by small springs, encased in a 3D-printed housing. It includes a rotary encoder to detect motion and a stepper motor to actuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motor allows programmatic control—pulling the lever to demonstrate shooting. This enables training by pairing visual cues with mechanical motion, reinforcing the association before the rat initiates the action on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Trigger&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Positive in-game actions trigger a liquid reward: sugar water delivered through a precise dispensing mechanism. The system consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixer: Continuously stirs the sugar solution to maintain even concentration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pump + Pressure Sensor: Keeps the line under constant pressure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solenoid Valve: Magnetic valve that opens to release exact 10 µL doses&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispenser: Positioned near the mouth for easy access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup ensures accurate, repeatable reward delivery with minimal delay. The reward is synchronized with game events to reinforce desired behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current system assumes basic rat mobility and grooming behavior. Fine-tuning might be needed for rats of different sizes or temperaments. Trigger placement and reward tube flow may need calibration per subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup is controlled through a modular Python system. The main entry point is arena_scenario.py, which runs the full control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motion capture: Reads movement from optical flow sensors mounted around the treadmill ball.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion control: Drives the ball motors to guide the rat during training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger input: Reads lever pulls, detects voluntary shooting actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward delivery: Dispenses precise 10 μL sugar water rewards via a controlled solenoid valve and maintains constant line pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOOM integration: Interfaces with a modified ViZDoom environment for real-time closed-loop behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training logic: Enforces demonstrations and delivers rewards based on game state and rat behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software runs on a PC and communicates with a Raspberry Pi via TCP sockets. The Pi handles real-time sensor reading, ball actuation, and reward control; the PC processes the sensor data, runs the game, and sends high-level commands to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All major components—movement tracking, ball driving, trigger detection, and reward control—can be operated manually or in closed-loop mode. All control parameters (e.g., motor speeds, reward volumes) are set in Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no in-built calibration suite. Users must validate sensor alignment and reward timing manually. Some microcontroller firmwares might require tuning based on hardware tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rats successfully learned to navigate the virtual environment and trigger the shooting mechanism. Habituation took approximately two weeks per rat. While advanced training wasn't completed due to time constraints, initial data showed promising engagement with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full behavioral validation requires longer training periods. Cross-subject variability wasn't extensively studied. The impact of prolonged VR exposure on rat well-being needs further research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Now?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;GNU Unifont is part of the GNU Project. This page contains the latest release of GNU Unifont, with glyphs for every printable code point in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). The BMP occupies the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode space, denoted as U+0000..U+FFFF. There is also growing coverage of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), in the range U+010000..U+01FFFF, and of Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) with Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Commercial Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial (non-free) software. The answer is yes. The GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that. See the next section for details. The main purpose of the licensing is to require derivative fonts that others create to be released to the public under the same licensing terms, not to prohibit the use of those fonts with certain software. Thus, preserving the license terms in derivative fonts provides a public benefit. The licenses also provide acknowledgement of previous Unifont contributors for their volunteer work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Copyright, Derivative Works, and License&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Unifont glyphs are creations of individual Unifont contributors; those glyphs enjoy copyright protections of various degrees. Some of those contributions are letter forms of established alphabets while others are icon (symbol) designs such as the many animal icons which, as artistic designs, have even stronger international protections. See for example this memorandum of applicable laws of Berne Union member country Germany (where Unifont was created): Unifont Copyright Protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Derivative variants of Unifont are permitted under the terms of the dual license: GNU GPLv2+ with the GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL Open Font License version 1.1. These are free licenses. The remainder of this section provides details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These font files are licensed under the GNU General Public License, either Version 2 or (at your option) a later version, with the exception that embedding the font in a document does not in itself constitute a violation of the GNU GPL. The full terms of the license are in LICENSE.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Unifont version 13.0.04, the fonts are dual-licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1 and the GNU GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception. The SIL OFL is available at OFL-1.1.txt.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The standard font build — with and without the ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) / Under-CSUR Private Use Area (PUA) glyphs. Download in your favorite format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; OpenType: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Standard Unifont OpenType Download: unifont-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unifont Japanese OpenType Version: unifont_jp-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Glyphs above the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane: unifont_upper-17.0.03.otf (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unicode ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) PUA Glyphs: unifont_csur-17.0.03.otf (0.5 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; BDF: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;unifont-17.0.03.bdf.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unifont Japanese BDF Version: unifont_jp-17.0.03.bdf.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specialized versions — built by request:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PSF: A specialized PSF 1 console frame buffer font consisting of 512 glyphs for use with APL, A Programming Language, in console mode (single-user mode on GNU/Linux, etc.), mainly to support GNU APL: Unifont-APL8x16-17.0.03.psf.gz (4 kbytes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: All the Plane 0 glyphs in Roman's .hex format, for those who wish to experiment: unifont-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: The above .hex file with combining circles added: unifont_sample-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Windows or Mac OS X, unzip the .ttf.zip file or download the uncompressed .ttf file and copy the font to your Fonts folder. On Microsoft Windows, this folder is located under the Windows folder on your main disk. On a Mac, this is located under the Library folder on your main disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For best appearance on a Mac in a Terminal window, select Terminal from the menu, then Preferences. A Settings window will appear. Make sure that you're on the Text tab in that window. Then make sure that the "Antialias text" box is checked. The OpenType version of the font should then look fine at point sizes of 12pt and larger. The font won't look very legible in a Mac Terminal window unless you select this antialias option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: BDF, PCF, and OpenType files contain dimension and spacing information for each glyph in a font. Some font rendering engines ignore this glyph information that the font file provides. This is especially true of rendering engines designed to handle monospace fonts. Unifont will not display all glyphs correctly with such software. The BDF font follows BDF version 2.1 (not version 2.2) because the the X Window System standardized on version 2.1. The PSF 1 version of Unifont is a monospace font but is limited to 512 glyphs, and is only of use with font rendering engines that support more than 256 glyphs in a console frame buffer font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All unifont.hex sources are in the full Unifont Utilities download page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unifont Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont only stores one glyph per printable Unicode code point. This means that complex scripts with special forms for letter combinations including consonant combinations and floating vowel marks such as with Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.) or letters that change shape depending upon their position in a word (Indic and Arabic scripts) will not render well in Unifont. In those cases, Unifont is only suitable as a font of last resort. Users wishing to properly render such complex scripts should use full OpenType fonts that faithfully display such alternate forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing New Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs, please email unifoundry at gmail in advance (not spelled out because of spammers). Several contributors are working on new glyphs, and it would be unfortunate to have multiple persons drawing the same glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Note: New Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a set of 15-by-16 pixel Chinese glyphs for Unicode Plane 2 and Plane 3. However, those glyphs are copyrighted and licensed for sale by the Government of the PRC, and thus they cannot be used in a free font. If you happen to have any of those copyrighted 15-by-16 pixel glyphs, please do not send them for inclusion. Unifont includes many glyphs in this range, drawn by Chinese and Japanese volunteers. More are planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This latest release is part of the GNU Project. You can view the GNU Project Unifont Page on Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the Unicode Plane 0 range is 65,536 code points minus the 2,048 surrogate pair code points, minus the 6,400 Private Use Area code points, minus the two noncharacters (U+FFFE and U+FFFF). This amounts to 57,086 assignable code points apart from the Private Use Area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the higher Unicode planes is 65,534; the last two code points in each plane are reserved as noncharacters.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of these are minor changes to baseline, iâjam positioning, or making a derived letter match its origin letter. Code points: U+0625, U+0634, U+0673, U+06B9, U+06BC, U+0753, U+0754, U+0757, U+075C, U+0762, U+0767, U+0769, U+076A, U+076D, U+0770, U+0775, U+0776, U+0777, U+077D, U+077E, U+08A1, U+08A2, U+08A3, U+08A6, U+08A8, U+08B1, U+08BB, and U+08BC.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ææ_Akatsuki (Xiao_Akatsuki) submitted several CJK refinements from the team of æ¹ è¿æ: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Improved è¤ (U+891D) and è (U+809E).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Updated to reflect current Unicode rendering: ã³½ (U+3CFD), ã¸¿ (U+3E3F), ä® (U+446E), ä³ (U+44B3), ä (U+4548), and ä©¶ (U+4A76).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Updated as per GB18030-2022 change: å (U+5795).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified to comply with the GB18030-2022 standard pertaining to character composition: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;å§ (U+59C9): This character is a phono-semantic character. Therefore, the right side should be "å¸" (U+5E02) instead of "å·¿" (U+5DFF).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;æ¿² (U+6FF2): This character is a variant of "ç" (U+7014), and the "ç©" (U+7A40) on the right side of "ç" (U+7014) is a phono-semantic character, and its "semantic" part is "ç¦¾" (U+79BE), not "æ¨" (U+6728).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;è¥ (U+81A5): This character is a Cantonese character for "egg". Not yet (æª) Become (æ) Meat (è) â Egg, so the upper left corner should be "æª" (U+672A), not "æ«" (U+672B).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;David Corbett: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redrew some Arabic Presentation Forms: U+FD42, U+FD43, U+FD44, U+FD45, U+FDF0, U+FDF1, U+FDF4, U+FDF6, U+FDF7, U+FDFA, U+FDFB, U+FDFC, U+FE87, U+FE88, U+FEB5, and U+FEB6.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified the top serifs of two Latin fullwidth letters, U+FF44 and U+FF4B.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Paul Hardy added new glyphs in Egyptian Hieroglyph Format Controls (U+13430..U+1345F).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Paul Hardy and David Corbett made adjustments to glyphs in the Musical Symbols block (U+1D100..U+1D1FF).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;ææ_Akatsuki modified U+25ED7 from 16 columns wide to 15 columns.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hayden Wong contributed U+29B00..U+29CFF.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cod'dte sent a corrected left-hand side of U+2EE57.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Luke036 has drawn a much-improved glyph for taito (U+3106C).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;æ¹ è¿æ: &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 12 September 2023 (Unifont 15.1.01) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As mentioned during the year leading up to this release, TrueType fonts are no longer produced by the default build; OpenType fonts have taken their place. This change has been driven by the diminishing support for TrueType fonts in the Pango font rendering engine. TrueType fonts can still be built from the distribution tarball using the command "make truetype" in the font directory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ho-Seok Ee proposed a new Johab encoding for algorithmic Hangul Syllables generation. The resulting scheme uses 6 variations of initial consonants (choseong), 3 of medial vowels and diphthongs (jungseong), and 1 of final consonants (jongseong). The image on the left is partial output from a new supporting Unifont utility,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;unijohab2html&lt;/code&gt;, which gives an overview of how the three components of a Hangul syllable combine with each other and outputs any overlaps for a font designer's analysis. A full discussion of this new Johab 6/3/1 encoding appears on the Unifont Hangul Syllables Generation web page. Minseo Lee (ì´ë¯¼ì) provided feedback on the glyphs prior to their release.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Following a suggestion by Ho-Seok Ee, the &lt;code&gt;hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;file that contains the Johab 6/3/1 glyphs for Hangul syllable formation now begins at code point U+E000. This allows building a Unifont variant with that entire Hangul johab glyph set in the Uniode Plane 0 Private Use Area (PUA) using the command "&lt;code&gt;make PUA=plane00/hangul/hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;". in the font directory. Unifont builds have traditionally left the PUA available for CSUR/UCSUR glyphs, which is still the default; see below for a discussion of the CSUR/UCSUR glyphs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Johnnie Weaver modified "IJ" ligature glyphs U+0132 and U+0133. He also modified U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Paul Hardy: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified U+2CC2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER CROSSED SHEI and U+2CC3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER CROSSED SHEI for consistency with the redrawn U+03E2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER SHEI and U+03E3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SHEI.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redrew Ideographic Description Characters (U+2FF0..U+2FFB) for consistency and added new glyphs (U+2FFC..U+2FFF). Also added CJK Strokes glyph U+31EF IDEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION CHARACTER SUBTRACTION.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified star glyphs U+2605, U+2606, and U+2BE8 for consistency.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified several Chinese ideographs and Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wen Quan Yi Glyphs: Made modifications to Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A U+3B9D, U+454E, U+49C8 (from æ¹ è¿æ) and U+56B8. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension U+809E and U+891D.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified Alchemical Symbols (U+1F700..U+1F77F) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Added three hexadecimal digit notations to the Plane 0 UCSUR: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBE0..U+EBEF: Boby Lapointe's "bibi-binary" notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBF0..U+EBFF: Bruce Alan Martin's bit location notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+ECF0..U+ECFF: Ronald O. Whitaker's triangular notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implemented other glyph changes per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Several other minor changes; see the ChangeLog file in the main tarball for details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The next table links to glyphs in Plane 1 (Supplementary Multilingual Plane) OpenType and TrueType &lt;code&gt;unifont_upper&lt;/code&gt;
      font files.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 2 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The table below links to the Japanese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the Plane 0 glyphs in 
      &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; font files provide complete coverage of the JIS X 0213
      standard.  Only 303 glyphs appear in the files below.  Files with no glyphs appear
      with a gray background.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This next table links to the Chinese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in &lt;code&gt;unifont&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the default Plane 0 glyphs
      in Unifont provide complete coverage of the Table of General Standard Chinese
      Characters (éç¨è§èæ±åè¡¨).  Only 232 glyphs appear in the files below.
      Files with no glyphs appear with a gray background.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 3 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 3 begins with the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G block, from U+30000 through U+3134A. This includes the highly complex biang Chinese ideograph and taito Japanese ideograph:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Biang (U+30EDD and U+30EDE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taito (Kanji) (U+3106C).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 14 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This table links to the two ranges of 256 assigned code points in Plane 14 (Tags and Variation Selector Supplement) that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_upper&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 0 and Plane 15 Private Use Area Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Finally, this last glyph table shows ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Under CSUR glyphs that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_csur&lt;/code&gt; OpenType
      and TrueType font files.  Not all of the Plane 0 CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      have been drawn, but given the esoteric nature of some CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      (including the unavailability of glyph samples for many of the more obscure
      constructed scripts), the boxes in the table all have a green background color
      even if not at 100% coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contributing Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs to the GNU Unifont effort, you can download the associated PNG file from the tables above (SMP and CSUR need additions). Then draw new glyphs in the 16-by-16 pixel area that is inside the inner box you see in the image on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When done, erase the surrounding inner box and ruler lines around the inner box. You can then save the file as a monochrome bitmap image. Then convert the .png file into a .hex file with the unipng2hex utility in the source tarball. Or you can just email the .png file to me as a contribution to this effort and I will do the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why is the outer grid so much larger than the 16-by-16 pixel inner box?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: Because in a future version, unipng2hex, unihex2png, and other utilities should be able to handle larger glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table below shows the current state of completion of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (Plane 1). Any range in the table that doesn't have a green background has missing glyphs. To see which scripts are in a particular range, consult the "Supplementary Multilingual Plane" list in the Current Coverage section below. The more red a range appears in the table below, the more glyphs are missing from that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Current Coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links in this section reference the first block of 256 glyphs where a script begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list below shows the scripts that are in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane, with coverage in this release of Unifont.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Variations Selectors Supplement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list below shows the scripts that are in Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR that have coverage in this release of Unifont:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially I just posted my additions to Roman Czyborra's original unifont.hex file. Then in mid-January 2008, his website went down. So I started posting font updates here. Roman has encouraged me to continue with my additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roman's website is now back online, and you can read his Unifont description and motivation for its creation on his website, along with his archive of Unifont's changes: http://czyborra.com/unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TrueType Font Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis Alejandro González Miranda wrote a cool combination of scripts to convert GNU Unifont from .hex format into FontForge .sfd format, then to have FontForge convert this to a TrueType outline font (see the Unicode Utilities web page on this site for more information). Pixels are drawn as outlined squares, so they scale to all point sizes. This works well with GNOME; I haven't tried it with any other Unix windowing environment. I've removed the OpenType SBIT font link from this page because the outline font is much more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis has given me permission to modify his scripts to convert the latest GNU Unifont versions to TrueType. I've modified his original scripts to handle Unicode combining characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JIS X 0213 Kanji&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Jiskan16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Unifont 12.1.02 added Japanese BDF and TrueType versions, &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt;.  This replaced over 10,000 ideographs
    in the default Unifont font with Japanese kanji from the 16 × 16
    pixel Jiskan 16 font.  The font is available in two files,
    corresponding to the two planes in JIS X 0213.  Both files are
    in the public domain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments in the BDF source font files (downloadable from the Japanese Fonts page) credit the following contributors (in order): Toshiyuki Imamura, HANATAKA Shinya, Taichi Kawabata, Koichi Yasuoka, TOYOSHIMA Masayuki, Kazuo Koike, and SATO Yasunao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Unifont release, the glyphs from the two JIS X 0213 planes were converted into Unifont .hex files and mapped to code points in Unicode's Plane 0 and Plane 2 for Unifont. The result provides complete representation of the kanji in JIS X 0213 in a free Unicode font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Izumi16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont 12.1.03 replaced the Jiskan16 glyphs with the public domain Izumi16 glyphs. These provide improvements on the earlier Jiskan16 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wen Quan Yi: Spring of Letters (文泉驛 / 文泉驿)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Unifont CJK glyphs were replaced by new CJK glyphs from version 1.1 of Qianqian Fang's Unibit font. The Unibit font began as a combination of the original GNU Unifont glyphs and a basic CJK bitmap font placed in the public domain by the People's Republic of China. It adopted GNU Unifont's scheme of 8x16 and 16x16 glyphs. Qianqian Fang and many others then added about 10,000 more glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian states in the Unibit distribution: "The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005 (public domain)." Wen Quan Yi volunteeers then edited thousands of these characters. Qianqian also drew the new 22 CJK ideographs in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB that appear in GNU Unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wen Quan Yi (WQY) means "spring of letters," as in a spring of water. This is an interesting choice of words, as the British spelling of "font" is "fount" (but still pronounced "font"). See his website for more details: http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi, or in Chinese at http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code points in the latest unifont.hex file are taken from the WQY Unibit font (with my additions to complete the U+3000..U+33FF range, particularly the missing Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji), including glyphs updated by the Wen Quan Yi volunteers and other modifications as part of the Unifont font:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian has given his okay to add these CJK glyphs from the Wen Quan Yi project into GNU Unifont. Likewise, I've told him to incorporate any glyphs he wants from my contributions to GNU Unifont into his Unibit font. In October 2020, Qianqian Fang also granted permission to apply the SIL Open Font License version 1.1 to Wen Quan Yi glyphs in Unifont as a dual license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the glyphs in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane that could easily be drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid have been drawn as of the Unifont 9.0.01 release. There are no plans to draw Tangut. A number of ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) scripts remain to be drawn. If you are interested in contributing glyphs to this effort, please contact me. All new contributions must be licensed under the same license as the rest of Unifont (in a nutshell, GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception and the SIL OFL 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the great work done by contributors in providing ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) glyphs, they are available in font files that have "_csur" in their name.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Lisp Interpreter Implemented in Conway's Game of Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp in Life is a Lisp interpreter implemented in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire pattern is viewable on the browser here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running Lisp on the Game of Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisp is a language with a simple and elegant design, having an extensive ability to express sophisticated ideas as simple programs. Notably, the powerful feature of macros could be used to modify the language’s syntax to write programs in a highly flexible way. For example, macros can be used to introduce new programming paradigms to the language, as demonstrated in object-oriented-like.lisp (which can actually be evaluated by the interpreter, although complex programs take quite a long time to finish running), where a structure and syntax similar to classes in Object Oriented Programming is constructed. Despite the expressibility of Lisp, it is the world’s second oldest high-level programming language introduced in 1958, only to be preceded by Fortran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton proposed in 1970. Despite it having a very simple set of rules, it is known to be Turing Complete. Lisp in Life demonstrates this fact in a rather straightforward way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can simple systems allow human thoughts to be articulated and be expanded? With the expressibility of Lisp and the basis of Conway’s Game of Life, Lisp in Life provides an answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Input and Output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp program is provided by editing certain cells within the pattern to represent the ASCII-encoding of the Lisp program. The pattern directly reads this text and evaluates the results. You can also load your own Lisp program into the pattern and run it. The standard output is written at the bottom end of the RAM module, which can be easily located and directly examined in a Game of Life viewer. The Lisp implementation supports lexical closures and macros, allowing one to write Lisp programs in a Lisp-like taste, as far as the memory limit allows you to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp interpreter is written in C. Using the build system for this project, you can also compile your own C11-compatible C code and run in on Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Previous Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entry featuring Universal Computers in LifeWiki has a list of computers created in the Game of Life. Two important instances not mentioned in this entry are the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project created by the authors of the QFT project, and APGsembly created by Adam P. Goucher. All of these work are designed to run an assembly language and are not designed to interpret a high-level language per se.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An example of a compiled high-level language targeted for the Game of Life is Cogol by the QFT project. Cogol is compiled to the assembly language QFTASM, targeted for the QFT architecture. Although Cogol is targeted for the QFT architecture, it requires compilation to QFTASM for the code to be run in the QFT architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Lisp in Life, a modified version of the QFT architecture is first created for improving the pattern’s runtime. Modifications include introducing a new cascaded storage architecture for the ROM, new opcodes, extending the ROM and RAM address space, etc. The Lisp source code is then written into the computer’s RAM module as its raw binary ASCII format. The Conway’s Game of Life pattern directly reads, parses, and evaluates this Lisp source code to produce its output. This feature of allowing a Conway’s Game of Life pattern to evaluate a high-level programming language expressed as a string of text is a novel feature that was newly achieved in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a YouTube video showing Lisp in Life in action:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Screenshots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An overview of the entire architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An overview of the CPU and its surrounding modules. On the top are the ROM modules, with the lookup module on the right, and the value modules on the left. On the bottom left is the CPU. On the bottom right is the RAM module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is the VarLife version of the architecture. VarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project, which is used as an intermediate layer to create the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern. The colors of the cells indicate the 8 distinct states of the VarLife rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture is based on Tetris8.mc in the original QFT repository. Various modifications were made to make the pattern compact, such as introducing a new lookup table architecture for the ROM, removing and adding new opcodes, expanding the ROM and RAM address space, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Conway’s Game of Life version of the architecture, converted from the VarLife pattern. What appears to be a single cell in this image is actually an OTCA metapixel zoomed away to be shown 2048 times smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A close-up view of a part of the ROM module in the Conway’s Game of Life version. Each pixel in the previous image is actually this square-shaped structure shown in this image. These structures are OTCA metapixels, which can be seen to be in the On and Off meta-states in this image. The OTCA Metapixel is a special Conway’s Game of Life pattern that can emulate cellular automatons with customized rules. The original VarLife pattern is simulated this way so that it can run in Conway’s Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OTCA Metapixel simulating Life in Life can be seen in this wonderful video by Phillip Bradbury: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A video of the RAM module in the VarLife rule in action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The computer showing the results of the following Lisp program:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(define mult (lambda (m n)
  (* m n)))

(print (mult 3 14))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, shown in binary ascii format (&lt;code&gt;0b110100&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0b110010&lt;/code&gt;), read in bottom-to-up order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown in this image, the standard output of the Lisp program gets written at the bottom end of the RAM module, and can be directly viewed in a Game of Life viewer. This repository also contains scripts that run on Golly to decode and view the contents of the output as strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How is it Done?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp interpreter, written in C, is compiled to an assembly language for a CPU architecture implemented in the Game of Life, which is a modification of the computer used in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project. The compilation is done using an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine). The Game of Life backend for ELVM was implemented by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generating a small enough pattern that runs in a reasonable amount of time required a lot of effort. This required optimizations and improvements in every layer of the project; a brief summary would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The C Compiler layer - adding the computed goto feature to the C compiler, preserving variable symbols to be used after compilation, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The C layer (the Lisp interpreter) - using a string hashtable and binary search for Lisp symbol lookup, minimization of stack region usage with union memory structures, careful memory region map design, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The QFTASM layer - writing a compiler optimizer to optimize the length of the assembly code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The VarLife layer (the CPU architecture) - creating a lookup table architecture for faster ROM access, expanding the size and length of the RAM module, adding new opcodes, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Game of Life layer - Hashlife-specific optimization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more detailed description of the optimizations done in this project is available in the Implementation Details section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conversion from VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project. It is used as an intermediate layer to generate the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern; the computer is first created in VarLife, and then converted to a Game of Life pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When converting VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life, each VarLife cell is mapped to an OTCA Metapixel (OTCAMP). The conversion from VarLife to the Game of Life is done in a way so that the behavior of the states of the VarLife pattern matches exactly with the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels in the converted Game of Life pattern. Therefore, it is enough to verify the behavior of the VarLife pattern to verify the behavior of the Game of Life pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the use of OTCA Metapixels, each VarLife cell becomes extended to a 2048x2048 Game of Life cell, and 1 VarLife generation requires 35328 Game of Life generations. Therefore, the VarLife patterns run significantly faster than the Game of Life (GoL) version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional details on VarLife are available in the Miscellaneous section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pattern Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pattern files preloaded with various Lisp programs are available here. Detailed statistics such as the running time and the memory consumption are available in the Running Times and Statistics section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The patterns can be simulated on the Game of Life simulator Golly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VarLife patterns can be simulated on Golly as well. To run the VarLife patterns, open Golly and see File -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; Control, and Check the “Your Rules” directory. Open the directory, and copy https://github.com/woodrush/QFT-devkit/blob/main/QFT-devkit/Varlife.rule to the directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Descriptions of the Lisp Programs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;object-oriented-like.lisp: This example creates a structure similar to classes in Object-Oriented Programming, using closures.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The class has methods and field variables, where each instance carries distinct and persistent memory locations of their own. The example instantiates two counters and concurrently modifies the value held by each instance.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;New syntaxes for instantiation and method access, &lt;code&gt;(new classname)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;(. instance methodname)&lt;/code&gt;, are introduced using macros and functions.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Lisp interpreter’s variable scope and the macro feature is powerful enough to manage complex memory management, and even providing a new syntax to support the target paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;printquote.lisp: A simple demonstration of macros.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;factorial.lisp: A simple demonstration of recursion with the factorial function.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;z-combinator.lisp: Demonstration of the Z Combinator to implement a factorial function using anonymous recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;backquote-splice.lisp: Implements the backquote macro used commonly in Lisp to construct macros. It also supports the unquote and unquote-splice operations, each written as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;~@&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;primes.lisp: Prints a list of prime numbers up to 20. This example highlights the use of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;syntax.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contents of print.lisp is quite straightforward - it calculates and prints the result of &lt;code&gt;3 * 14&lt;/code&gt;.
backquote.lisp and primes-print.lisp are similar to backquote-splice.lisp and primes.lisp, mainly included for performance comparisons.
backquote.lisp doesn’t implement the unquote-splice operation, and demonstrates some more examples.
primes-print.lisp reduces the number of list operations to save memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Details of the Lisp Interpreter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Forms and Builtin Functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;define&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;quote&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;car, cdr&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;cons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;list&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;atom&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;progn&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;while&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lambda, macro&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;eval&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;eq&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;+, -, *, /, mod, &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lexical Closures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Lisp interpreter supports lexical closures. The implementation of lexical closures is powerful enough to write an object-oriented-like code as shown in object-oriented-like.lisp, where classes are represented as lexical closures over the field variables and the class methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Macros&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Lisp interpreter supports macros. Lisp macros can be thought as a function that receives code and returns code. Following this design, macros are treated exacly the same as lambdas, except that it takes the arguments as raw S-expressions, and evaluates the result twice (the first time to build the expression, and the second time to actually evaluate the builded expression).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The running times for each program are shown above. The Hashlife algorithm used for the simulation requires a lot of memory in exchange of speedups. The simulations were run on a 32GB-RAM computer, with Golly’s memory usage limit set to 28000 MB, and the default base step to 2 (configurable from the preferences). The memory usage was measured by Ubuntu’s activity monitor. “(max.)” shows where the maximum permitted memory was used. The number of CPU cycles and the QFT memory usage was obtained by running the QFTASM interpreter on the host PC. The QFT memory usage shows the number of RAM addresses that were written at least once. The memory usage is measured in words, which is 16 bits in this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the VarLife patterns can actually be run on a computer. The shortest running time is about 1 minute for print.lisp. A sophisticated program such as object-oriented-like.lisp can even run in about 22 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Game of Life patterns take significantly more time than the VarLife patterns, but for short programs it can be run in a moderately reasonable amount of time. For example, print.lisp finishes running in about 6 hours in the Game of Life pattern. As mentioned in the “Conversion from VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life” section, since the Game of Life pattern emulates the behavior of the VarLife pattern using OTCA Metapixels, the behavior of the Game of Life patterns can be verified by running the VarLife patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are tests to check the behavior of the Lisp interpreter. There is a test for checking the QFTASM-compiled Lisp interpreter using the QFTASM interpreter, and a test for checking the GCC-compiled Lisp interpreter on the host pc. To run these tests, use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git submodule update --init --recursive # Required for building the source

make test             # Run the tests for the QFTASM-compiled Lisp interpreter, using the QFTASM interpreter
make test_executable  # Run the tests for the executable compiled by GCC
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;make test&lt;/code&gt; requires Hy, a Clojure-like Lisp implemented in Python available via &lt;code&gt;pip install hy&lt;/code&gt;.
Some of the tests compare the output results of Hy and the output of the QFTASM Lisp interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tests were run on Ubuntu and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building from Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section explains how to load the Lisp interpreter (written in C) to the Game of Life pattern, and also how to load a custom Lisp program into the pattern to run it on Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section describes the implementation details for the various optimizations for the QFT assembly and the resulting Game of Life pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The C Compiler layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added the computed goto feature to ELVM &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This was merged into the original ELVM project.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modified the compiler to preserve and output memory address symbols and program address symbols, for their usage in the compiler optimization tool in the QFTASM layer &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This allows to use memheader.eir, so that symbols used in the C source can be referenced in the ELVM assembly layer using the same variable symbols.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The ELVM Assembly layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wrote the QFTASM backend for ELVM &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This was merged into the original ELVM project.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added further improvements to the QFTASM backend: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Let the ELVM assembly’s memory address space match QFT’s native memory address space &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Originally, the ELVM assembly had to convert its memory address every time when a memory access occurs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support new opcodes added in the improved QFT architecture&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Let the ELVM assembly’s memory address space match QFT’s native memory address space &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The C layer (the implementation of the Lisp interpreter)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Usage of binary search and hashtables for string representations and comparisons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By profiling the GCC-compiled version of the Lisp interpreter, it was found that the string table lookup process was a large performance bottleneck. This was a large room for optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimized string lookup process is as follows. First, when the Lisp parser accepts a symbol token, it creates a 4-bit hash of the string with the checksum of the ASCII representation of the string. The hash points to a hashtable that holds the root of a binary search tree for string comparison. Each node in the tree holds the string of the symbol token, and two nodes that are before and after the token in alphabetical order. When a query symbol token arrives in the parsing phase, a node with a matching token is returned, or a new node for the token is added into this binary tree if the token does not exist yet. This allows for each distinct symbol in the S-expression to have a distinct memory address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the interpretation phase, since each distinct symbol has a distinct memory address, and every string required for the Lisp program has already been parsed, string comparison can be done by simply comparing the memory address of the tokens. Since the interpreter only uses string equality operations for string comparison, simply checking for integer equality suffices for string comparison, speeding up the interpretation phase. Since the hash key is 4 bits long, this allows for reducing 4 searches in the binary tree compared to using a single binary tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Usage of jump hash tables for the special form evaluation procedure searches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 17 distinct procedures for evaluating the special forms in the Lisp interpreter, &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;quote&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cdr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;progn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, {&lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt;}, &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt;, {&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mod&lt;/code&gt;}, {&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;}, &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, and lambda/macro invocations (when if the token is not a special form). Using an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement to find the corresponding procedure for a given token becomes a linear search for the token comparisons. To speed up this search process, a hash table is created for jumping to the corresponding procedures. Since the memory addresses for the special forms can be determined before parsing the Lisp program, all of the symbols for the special forms have a fixed memory address. Therefore, the hash key can be created by subtracting an offset to the symbol’s memory address, to point to a hashtable that is created near the register locations. This hashtable is provided in memheader.eir. When the hash key is larger than the regions of this hashtable, it means that the symbol is not a special form, so the evaluation jumps to the lambda/macro invocation procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Usage of 2-bit headers to represent value types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp implementation has 3 distinct value types, &lt;code&gt;ATOM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;LAMBDA&lt;/code&gt;. Each value only consumes one QFT byte of memory; the &lt;code&gt;ATOM&lt;/code&gt; value holds the pointer to the symbol’s string hashtable, the &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt; value holds the signed integer value, and &lt;code&gt;LAMBDA&lt;/code&gt; holds a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;Lambda&lt;/code&gt; struct, as well as its subtype information, of either &lt;code&gt;LAMBDA&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MACRO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TEMPLAMBDA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TEMPMACRO&lt;/code&gt;. (The &lt;code&gt;TEMPLAMBDA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TEMPMACRO&lt;/code&gt; subtypes are lambda and macro types that recycles its argument value memory space every time it is called, but is unused in the final lisp programs.) Since the RAM’s address space is only 10 bits, there are 6 free bits that can be used for addresses holding pointers. Therefore, the value type and subtype information is held in these free bits. This makes the integer in the Lisp implementation to be a 14-bit signed integer, ranging from -8192 to 8191.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Minimization of Stack Region Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the C compiler used in this project does not have memory optimization features, this has to be done manually within the C source code. This led to the largest reason why the interpreter’s source code seems to be obfuscated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the largest bottlenecks for memory access was stack region usage. Every time a stack region memory access occurs, the assembly code performs memory address offset operations to access the stack region. This does not happen when accessing the heap memory, since there is only one heap region used in the entire program, so the pointers for global variables can be hard-coded by the assembler. Therefore, it is favorable optimization-wise to use the heap memory as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to make use of this fact is to use as much global variables as possible. Since registers and common RAM memory share the same memory space, global variables can be accessed with a speed comparable to registers (However, since the physical location of the RAM memory slot within the pattern affects the I/O signal arrival time, and the registers have the most smallest RAM addresses, i.e. they are the closest to the CPU unit, the registers have the fastest memory access time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another method of saving memory was to use union memory structures to minimize the stack region usage. In the C compiler used in this project, every time a new variable is introduced in a function, the function’s stack region usage (used per call) is increased to fit all of the variables. This happens even when two variables never appear at the same time. Therefore, using the fact that some variables never appear simultaneously, unions are used for every occurence of such variables, so that they can use a shared region within the stack space. This led to minimization of the stack region usage. Since the stack region is only 233 hextets (1 byte in the QFT RAM is 16 bits) large, this allowed to increase the number of nested function calls, especially the nested calls of &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; which evaluates the S-expressions. Since the S-expressions have a list structure, and &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; becomes nested when lambdas are called in the Lisp program, this optimization was significant for allowing more sophisticated Lisp programs to be run in the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The QFTASM layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The QFT assembly generated by the C compiler has a lot of room for optimization. I therefore created a compiler optimization tool to reduce the QFTASM assembly size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Constant folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediate constant expressions such as &lt;code&gt;ADD 1 2 destination&lt;/code&gt; is folded to a &lt;code&gt;MOV&lt;/code&gt; operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MOV&lt;/code&gt; folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The QFT assembly code can be splitted into subregions by jump operations, such that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each subregion doesn’t contain any jump operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each subregion ends with a jump operation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Every jump operation in the assembly is guaranteed to jump to the beginning of a subregion, and never to the middle of any subregion&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last guarantee where jumps never occur in the middle of a subregion is provided by the C compiler. The ELVM assembly’s program counter is designed so that it increases only when a jump instruction appears. This makes an ELVM program counter to point to a sequence of multiple instructions, instead of a single instruction. Since the ELVM assembly uses the ELVM program counter for its jump instructions, it is guaranteed that the jump instructions in the QFT assembly never jump to the middle of any subregion, and always jumps to a beginning of a subregion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In each subregion, the dependency graph for the memory address is created. If a memory address becomes written but is later overwritten without becoming used in that subregion at all, the instruction to write to that memory address is removed. Since it is guaranteed that jump operations never jump to the middle of any subregion, it is guaranteed that the overwritten values can be safely removed without affecting the outcome of the program. The &lt;code&gt;MOV&lt;/code&gt; folding optimization makes use of this fact to remove unnecessary instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This folding process is also done with dereferences; if a dereferenced memory address is written, and the address is overwritten without being used at all, and the dereference source is unoverwritten at all during this process, the instruction for writingto the dereferenced memory address is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Jump folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the destination of a conditional or fixed-destination jump instruction points to another jump instruction with a fixed destination, the jump destination is folded to the latter jump instruction’s destination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar folding is done when a fixed jump instruction points to a conditional jump instruction, where the fixed jump instruction is replaced by the latter conditional jump instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Varlife layer (the computer architecture)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Created the with a lookup table structure for the ROM module&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this image of the CPU and its surrounding modules, the two modules on the top are the ROM modules. The original ROM module had one table, with the memory address as the key and the instruction as the value. I recreated the ROM module to add a lookup table layer, where each distinct instruction (not the opcodes, but the entire instruction including the values used within) holds a distinct serial integer key. The ROM module on the right accepts a program counter address and returns the instruction key for the program counter. The module on the left accepts the instruction key and returns the actual bits of the instruction as the output. This allows for dictionary compression to be performed to the ROM data, saving a lot of space. Since the instructions are 45 bits and the instruction keys are only 10 bits, the instruction key table is 1/4 the size of the original ROM module. Although the ROM size is 3223 for the entire Lisp interpreter, there were only 616 distinct instructions in the Lisp interpreter, making the size of the instruction table be 616 ROM units high, effectively reducing the ROM module size altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ROM module features another form of compression, where absence of cells are used to represent 0-valued bits within the instruction. Below is a close-up look of the ROM value module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that some cells on the left are absent, despite the table being expected to be a rectangular shape. This is because absent cells do not emit any signals, hence effectively emitting 0-valued bits as the output. To use this fact, all of the instructions are first alphabetically ordered at table creation time, so that instructions that start with trailing zeroes become located higher in the table (further from the signal source). This allows for a maximum number of cells to be replaced with absent units to represent 0-valued bits. In fact, the instruction for no-ops is represented as all zeroes, so all of the units in the value module are replaced by absent cells. The no-op instruction appears a lot of times immediately after the jump operation, due to the fact that the QFT architecture has a branch delay when invoking a jump instruction, requiring a no-op instruction to be present to compensate for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Added new optimized instructions to the ALU, and removed unused ones&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I removed the &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SL&lt;/code&gt; (shift left), &lt;code&gt;SRL&lt;/code&gt; (shift right logical), and the &lt;code&gt;SRA&lt;/code&gt; (shift right arithmetical) opcodes, and added the &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt; (shift right unit) and &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt; (shift right eight) opcodes to the architecture. Since there already were opcodes for &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise-xor) and &lt;code&gt;ANT&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise-and-not), &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;, which were not used much in the interpreter, could be replaced by these opcodes. The bitshift operations had significantly larger patterns than the other opcodes, being more than 10 times larger than the other opcodes. These were reduced to a fixed-size shift operations which could be implemented in the same sizes as the other opcodes. Since the shift left opcode can be replaced by consecutively adding its own value, effectively multiplying by powers of 2, the opcode was safely removed. The main reason for the original bitshift units being large was due to the shift amounts being dependent on the values of the RAM. Converting a binary value to a physical (in-pattern) shift amount required a large pattern. On the other hand, shifting a fixed value could be implemented by a significantly more simpler pattern. The shift right eight instruction is mainly used for reading out the standard input, where each ASCII character in the input string is packed into one 16-bit RAM memory address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resulted in a total of exactly 8 opcodes, &lt;code&gt;ANT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MLZ&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;MNZ&lt;/code&gt;. Since this can fit in 3 bits, the opcode region for the instruction value was reduced by 1 bit. Since the RAM module is 10 bits, and the third value of the instruction is always the writing destination of the RAM, and the first instruction can also be made so that it becomes the reading source address of the RAM, this allows for an additional 6*2=12 bits to be reduced from the instruction length. These altogether has reduced the ROM word size from 58 to 45 bits, reducing nearly 1/4 of the original instruction size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Extended the ROM and RAM address space from 9,7-bit to 12,10-bit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original QFT architecture had a ROM and RAM address space of 9 and 7 bits. I extended the ROM and RAM address space to 12 and 10 bits, respectively. This was not a straightforward task as it first seemed, since the signal arrival timings between the modules had to be carefully adjusted in order for the signals to line up correctly. This involved reverse-engineering and experimenting undocumented VarLife pattern units used in the original QFT architecture. The same held for when redesigning other parts of the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Reducing the Standard Input Size&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since each byte of the RAM module can be ordered arbitrarily in the CPU’s architecture, the RAM is arranged so that the standard output is written at the very bottom of the RAM module, and proceeds upwards. Therefore, the contents of the RAM can easily be observed in a Game of Life viewer by directly examining the bottom of the RAM module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since RAM has 16 bits of memory per memory address, it allows to fit two ASCII-encoded characters per one address. Therefore, the standard input is read out by reading two characters per address. For the standard output, one character is written to one address for aesthetic reasons, so that the characters can be directly observed in a Game of Life viewer the pattern more easily. Also, for the standard output to proceed upwards within the RAM module pattern, the memory pointer for the standard output proceeds backwards in the memory space, while the pointer for the standard input proceeds forwards in the memory space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Game of Life layer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimizing the Game of Life layer mainly revolved around understanding the Macrocell format for representing and saving Game of Life patterns, and the Hashlife algorithm. The Macrocell format uses quadtrees and memoization for compressing repeated patterns. Since the final Game of Life pattern is an array of OTCA metapixels which are 2048x2048 large, and even has repeated patterns in the VarLife layer (meaning that there are repeated configurations of OTCA metapixels), this compression reduces the file size for the QFT pattern significantly. The best example that let me understand the Macrocell format was an example provided by Adam P. Goucher in this thread in Golly’s mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hashlife algorithm also uses quadtrees and memoization to speed up the Game of Life simulations. This algorithm makes use of the fact that the same pattern in a same time frame influences only a fixed extent of its surrounding regions, hence allowing for memoization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for optimization, I first noticed that the QFT pattern had a 1-pixel high pattern concatenated to the entire pattern. The original QFT pattern in the original QFT repository was carefully designed so that it is composed of 8x8-sized pattern units. Therefore, most of the patterns can be represented by 8x8 tiles. However, since the 1-pixel high pattern at the top creates an offset that shifts away the pattern from this 8x8 grid, it causes the pattern to have fewer repeated patterns if interpreted from the corner of its bounding box, causing the memoization to work inefficiently. I therefore tried putting a redundant cell (which does not interfere with the rest of the pattern) to realign the entire pattern to its 8x8 grid, which actually slightly reduced the resulting Macrocell file size from the original one. Although I didn’t compare the running times, since the Hashlife algorithm uses memoization over repeated patterns as well, I expect this optimization to at least slightly contribute to the performance of the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another optimization was improving the metafier script used to convert VarLife patterns to Game of Life (MetafierV3.py). The original script used a square region to fit the entire pattern to create the quadtree representation. However, since the Lisp in Life VarLife pattern is 968 pixels wide but 42354 pixels high, it tried to allocate a 65536x65536-sized integer array, which was prohibitively large to run. I modified the script so that it uses a rectangular region, where absent regions of the quadtree are represented as absent cells. Although this is very straightforward with the knowledge of the Macrocell format, it was difficult at first until I became fond of the algorithms surrounding the Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memory Region Map and the Phases of Operation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memory region map is carefully designed to save space. This is best described with the operation phases of the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Phase 0: Precalculations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Various precalculations are done after the interpreter starts running. The construction of the string interning hashtable for reserved atoms such as &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;quote&lt;/code&gt;, etc. are done in this phase. For the GCC-compiled interpreter, some variables that are defined in the QFT memory header are defined in the C source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the outcome of these precalculations are always the same for any incoming Lisp program, this phase is done on the host PC, and the results are saved as ramdump.csv during the QFTASM compile time. The results are then pre-loaded into the RAM when the VarLife and Game of Life patterns are created. This allows to saves some CPU cycles when running the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, the QFT architecture holds register values in the RAM. There are 11 registers, which are placed in the addresses from 0 to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reserved values in the image include strings such as reserved atoms and the destinations of the jump hashtable used for evaluation. The rest of the region is used for storing global variables in the interpreter’s C source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Phase 1: Parsing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Lisp program provided from the standard input is parsed into S-expressions, which is written into the heap region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the string interning hashtables are created in the later end of the stack region. This is because these hashtables are only used during the parsing phase, and can be overwritten during the evaluation phase. For most Lisp programs including the ones in this repository, the stack region does not grow far enough to overwrite these values. This allows to place 3 growing memory regions during the parsing phase, the stack region used for nested S-expressions, the heap region which stores the parsed S-expressions, and the string interning hashtables when new strings are detected within the Lisp program. Newly detected strings such as variable names in the Lisp program are also written into the heap region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heap region is also designed so that it overwrites the standard input as it parses the program. Since older parts of the program can be discarded once it is parsed, this allows to naturally free the standard input region which save a lot of space after parsing. The standard input also gets overwritten by the Standard output if the output is long enough. However, due to this design, long programs may have trouble at parsing, since the input may be overwritten too far and get deleted before it is parsed. A workaround for this is to use indentation which places the program further ahead into the memory, which will prevent the program from being overwritten from the growing heap region. For all of the programs included in this repository, this is not an issue and the programs become successfully parsed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Phase 2: Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this time, all of the contents of the stack region and what is ahead of the head of the heap region can be overwritten in the further steps. Note that a similar issue with the standard input happens with the standard output - when too many Lisp objects are created during runtime, it may overwrite the existing standard output, or may simply exceed the heap region and proceed into the stack region. Since the heap region is connected to the later end of the stack region, this may be safe if the standard output is carefully handled, but the interpreter will eventually start overwriting values of the stack region if the heap continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How can a 2-state OTCA Metapixel emulate the behavior of an 8-state VarLife pattern?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one of the most interesting ideas in the original QFT project to make the QFT architecture possible. As explained in the original QFT post, the 8 states of VarLife are actually a mixture of 4 different birth/survival rules with binary states. This means that each VarLife cell can only transition between two fixed states, and the birth/survival rule for that cell does not change at any point in time. Moreover, the OTCA Metapixel is designed so that each metapixel can carry its own birth/survival rules. Therefore, each VarLife cell can be enoded into an OTCA Metapixel by specifying its birth/survival rule and the binary state. This means that the array of OTCA Metapixels in the metafied pattern is actually a mixture of metapixels with different birth/survival rules, arranged in a way so that it makes the computation possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Halting Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the program counter is set to 65535 and the program exits, no more ROM and RAM I/O signals become apparent in the entire module. This makes the VarLife pattern becomes completely stationary, where every pattern henceforth becomes completely identical. Defining this as the halting time for the calculation, the pattern for print.lisp halts at exactly 105,413,068 VarLife generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The halting time for the Game of Life patterns are defined similarly for the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels. Since OTCA Metapixels never become stationary, the Game of Life states do not become stationary after the halting time, but the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become stationary after the halting time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the VarLife pattern of print.lisp, by generation 105,387,540, the value 65535 gets written to the program counter. At generation 105,413,067, the last signal becomes just one step from disappearing, and at generation 105,413,068 and onwards, the pattern becomes completely stationary and every pattern becomes identical to each other. In the Game of Life version, since the OTCA Metapixel continues running indefinitely, the pattern does not become completly stationary, but the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become completely stationary, since it is an emulation of the VarLife pattern. Note that the halting times for programs other than print.lisp is just a sufficient number of generations, and not the exact values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The required number of generations per CPU cycle depends on many factors such as the ROM and RAM addresses and the types of opcodes, since the arriving times of the I/O signals depend on factors such as these as well. This makes the number of generations required for the program to halt become different between each program. For example, print.lisp has a rate of 23822.16 generations per CPU cycle (GpC), but z-combinator.lisp has a rate of 28870.81 GpC, and primes-print.lisp has 31502.43 GpC. 23822.16 GpC is in fact insufficient for z-combinator.lisp to finish running, and 28870.81 is also insufficient for primes-print.lisp to finish running.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The ALU unit in the CPU. From the left are the modules for the &lt;code&gt;ANT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XOR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUB&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MLZ&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;MNZ&lt;/code&gt; opcodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;SRE&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;SRU&lt;/code&gt; opcodes were newly added for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The CPU architecture used in this project was originally created by the members of the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project, and was later optimized and modified by Hikaru Ikuta for the Lisp in Life project. The VarLife cellular automaton rule was also defined by the members of the QFT project. The metafier for converting VarLife patterns to Conway’s Game of Life patterns was written by the members of the QFT project, and was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta to support the pattern size of the Lisp in Life architecture. The assembly language for the QFT architecture, QFTASM, was also originally designed by the members of the QFT project, and was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta for this project for achieving a feasible running time. The Lisp interpreter was written by Hikaru Ikuta. The compilation of the interpreter’s C source code to the ELVM assembly is done using an extended version of 8cc written by Rui Ueyama from Google. The compilation from the ELVM assembly to QFTASM is done by an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine), a project by Shinichiro Hamaji from Preferred Networks, Inc. The Game of Life backend for ELVM was written by Hikaru Ikuta, and was later further extended by Hikaru for the Lisp in Life project.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In my 30’s, I exercised to look good. In my 50’s, to stay fit. In my 70’s, to stay ambulatory. In my 80’s, to avoid assisted living. Now in my 90’s, I’m just doing it out of pure defiance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of all of my grandparents and great grandparents, they all lived really hard lives eating high fat diets, drinking and smoking, and lived into their 80s. Genetics is really the biggest determining factor outside of going completely off the rails with binge eating and drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that's not to say that healthy living is pointless. Their quality of life from late 60s on was not great: alcoholism, poverty, multiple heart attacks, emphasima, a stroke here and there, from which they eventually, sort of, not really recovered. They were deeply unhappy people who never really seemed to have time or care for their families. I definitely don't want to live like that. So treat yourself right, but not because you're trying to reach a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Genetics is really the biggest determining factor outside of going completely off the rails with binge eating and drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So true. I'm fortunate that both my parents have long-life family histories. Both families were old-fashioned Southern Baptists who didn't drink, smoke, dance or, apparently, believe in having fun of any kind :-). But that just kept them from messing up their good genetic luck. I'm an old-fashioned atheist but have chosen to never drink, smoke or do drugs just because I never saw a compelling reason to. Now I'm pushing 60 and have so far had zero serious health issues. Hoping to keep a good thing going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I'm an old-fashioned atheist but have chosen to never drink, smoke or do drugs just because I never saw a compelling reason to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am 17 and I am the same here (atheist) and similar and yeah I see no reason to do these things either and I actively see the negative harmful effects it can have so I am not gonna do these things at all ever in my life too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It clearly wasn’t ’that bad’ for most human history given how prevalent it was. But in the modern world we are trauma merchants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What in the actual fuck kind of logic brought you here to that conclusion? I worry for you and whatever content you’ve consumed over the years that allowed you to build up this theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well I did a Psych minor for lols back in the day and there's no doubt that almost all of current social psychology is made up of trauma merchants peddling their wares. 'Step 1: gaslight you into thinking you're fucked up Step 2: Convince you I'm the one who can help you' kind of shit. Psychologists obviously get upset by the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in terms of rape, as I said in my original comment it's just a suspicion. Happy to hear your counterarguments if you have any.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago I found The Dick Van Dyke Show free to watch on Youtube. I had seen a number of the episodes in passing over the years, but never really watched it. It's really quite a good show. Highly recommended, even if YouTube's viewing experience for TV series is sub-par.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE Dick van Dyke, from Mary Poppins, Diagnosis: Murder, ans so many more?! I always thought it was just a coincidental same name as I never saw videos about this. Oh my! This guy is amazing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no idea he's an animator, that's so cool! In that video he says "Lightwave is so deep, I won't live long enough to see everything that's in it". I'm glad he's proven wrong there!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know his son Barry. He said his first memory he has was his Dad doing real time drawings for people telling stories. He was behind the story teller on stage on giant pads of paper as a comedy bit at night clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also remembers having giant bags of toys dumped on the floor of the hotel rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many A-listers are polymaths. For example, Phil Hartman, used to be Phil Hartmann (extra "n"), and designed some of the most iconic album covers of the 1970s, and Steve Martin is one of the best banjo players out there. It used to be part of his standup bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dick Van Dyke came from the tail end of Vaudeville, where performers had to have a whole variety of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: Every one of these folks that hits the limelight, beat out thousands of others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think our vocation is competitive? Showbiz says "Hold my beer."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just looked it up and saw he did an album cover for Steely Dan. It reminded me that Chevy Chase was an early drummer for Steely Dan (well, before they became "Steely Dan")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hedy Lamarr was a prolific inventor. Among other things, she developed a frequency-hopping spread spectrum radio transmission technique for torpedo guidance and donated the patent to the US Navy during WW2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Steve Martin is one of the best banjo players out there&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he’s great with a lasso!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love his albums with Edie Brickell, he’s good with Steep Canyon Rangers, and more recently have heard him shine with Alison Brown (banjo), Sierra Hull (mandolin), and others in his latest tour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the top banjo players technically, you might check out Béla Fleck, Jens Kruger, Noam Pikelny, Tony Trischka, Bill Keith, Don Reno, and Earl Scruggs. I’ve personally heard superhuman performances by Jens Kruger in-person and I grew up on Scruggs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Makes sense. My grandpa is one year his junior and you would never see him react too strongly to anything, even though grandma (also still alive) always had an, ahem, fiery personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also he refuses to sit and moves around all the time, venturing outside every day from their apartment four floors above ground without a lift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly his own father didn't make it to his 60s, so there's certainly a lifestyle component to this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;z8086: Rebuilding the 8086 from Original Microcode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 486Tang, I wanted to go back to where x86 started. The result is z8086: a 8086/8088 core that runs the original Intel microcode. Instead of hand‑coding hundreds of instructions, the core loads the recovered 512x21 ROM and recreates the micro‑architecture the ROM expects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;z8086 is compact and FPGA‑friendly: it runs on a single clock domain, avoids vendor-specific primitives, and offers a simple external bus interface. Version 0.1 is about 2000 lines of SystemVerilog, and on a Gowin GW5A device, it uses around 2500 LUTs with a maximum clock speed of 60 MHz. The core passes all ISA test vectors, boots small programs, and can directly control peripherals like an SPI display. While it doesn’t boot DOS yet, it’s getting close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why another x86?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 8086 is where the x86 story began. If you want to understand why x86 feels like x86 — segmented addressing, ModR/M, the prefetch queue, the oddball string instructions — this is the chip to study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, reverse-engineering of the 8086 has reached a surprisingly level of maturity. We now have Ken Shirriff’s massive 8086 blog series and Andrew Jenner’s disassembled microcode. Combined with the original 8086 patent, these resources make it possible to rebuild a faithful core instead of a functional approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goals were simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Faithful where it counts. Accurately replicate the microarchitectural behavior of the original 8086 wherever it matters most.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Designed to be explorable and educational. The code is thoroughly commented to make it clear and easy to understand. Aims to be a good teaching resource.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FPGA-friendly and practical. z8086 is built to be an effective, useful CPU IP core for real FPGA projects.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Re‑creating the 8086&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the high‑level view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You can cross-reference function blocks against the die shot.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a bird’s‑eye level the pipeline is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefetch queue → Loader (FC/SC) → Microcode sequencer → EU/BIU datapath&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is like the original chip’s split. The BIU (bus interface unit) runs ahead, fetching bytes into a 6‑byte queue whenever the bus is idle. The EU (execution unit) consumes bytes from that queue, decodes them, and drives the microcode engine. When the EU needs memory, it issues a Type‑6 micro‑op; the BIU yields the bus and prefetch pauses. That overlap is why the 8086 feels “pipelined” despite being a late‑70s design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microcode is the glue here. Each 21‑bit micro‑instruction encodes a move (5‑bit source → 5‑bit destination on an internal bus) plus an action (ALU op, short/long jump, bookkeeping, or a bus cycle). The sequencer advances through &lt;code&gt;{AR, CR}&lt;/code&gt; addresses until the microcode asserts “run next instruction.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some key pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microcode engine. The sequencer keeps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{AR, CR}&lt;/code&gt;(plus&lt;code&gt;SR&lt;/code&gt;for calls), fetches 21‑bit words from&lt;code&gt;ucode.hex&lt;/code&gt;, and executes them as a tight move→action loop.&lt;code&gt;ROME&lt;/code&gt;marks active execution. When microcode wants a queue byte (&lt;code&gt;LOC_Q&lt;/code&gt;) but the queue is empty, or when an EU bus cycle is in flight, a&lt;code&gt;stall&lt;/code&gt;signal freezes&lt;code&gt;CR&lt;/code&gt;so the ROM sees exactly the timing it expects.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translation + group decode. The original 8086 uses ROMs to (1) classify opcodes into ~15 “group” signals (“has ModR/M,” “prefix,” “uses w‑bit,” “grp3/4/5,” etc.), and (2) map&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{opcode, ModR/M}&lt;/code&gt;to microcode entry points for effective‑address and control‑flow routines. z8086 implements these as combinational replicas (&lt;code&gt;group_decode()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;translate()&lt;/code&gt;), derived from the dumped ROM truth tables. This is what lets the recovered microcode drop straight in without being rewritten.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bus + unaligned access. Externally you get&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rd/wr/io/word/ready&lt;/code&gt;with aligned cycles, so FPGA memory is easy to hook up. Internally the EU still issues Type‑6 bus micro‑ops with the right segment defaults and overrides. If a word access lands on an odd address, the bus FSM automatically splits it into two byte cycles (&lt;code&gt;BUS_UNALIGNED&lt;/code&gt;), so software sees real 8086 semantics while the outside world stays aligned.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ALU + flags. The ALU is implemented as a classic 16×1‑bit slice, controlled by signals modeled after Intel’s original logic. The initial ALU design used Verilog primitives, but this updated bit‑slice version is both smaller and faster, closely replicating the behavior of the original chip’s ALU.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One concrete example: for a ModR/M instruction like &lt;code&gt;ADD AX, [BX+SI+4]&lt;/code&gt;, the loader’s &lt;code&gt;FC&lt;/code&gt; grabs the opcode, &lt;code&gt;SC&lt;/code&gt; grabs the ModR/M byte, &lt;code&gt;translate()&lt;/code&gt; jumps into the right effective‑address micro‑routine, the EU reads the operand through a Type‑6 bus cycle into &lt;code&gt;OPR&lt;/code&gt;, the ALU updates &lt;code&gt;SIGMA&lt;/code&gt; and flags, and a final Type‑6 writeback happens only if the instruction targets memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Interesting discoveries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Microcode is super efficient&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 8086 shipped with ~29K transistors and still delivered a very rich CISC ISA: segmented addressing, ModR/M base+index+disp modes, and weirdly specialized instructions like &lt;code&gt;DAA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;XLAT&lt;/code&gt;. The trick was microcode. A small internal datapath plus ROM sequencing let Intel implement a huge instruction surface area without exploding logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contrast with other CPUs is striking. The 6502 (~4.5K transistors) and Z80 (~8.5K) are elegant, mostly hardwired, and highly minimalist designs. In comparison, the 8086 features a much wider datapath, significantly more instructions and features, yet manages to do so with less than four times the transistor count of the Z80. The 68000 (~68K transistors) takes a different approach, using far more silicon for its fully hardwired CISC design. Remarkably, the 8086 achieves a similar feature set with less than half the transistor count of the 68000. This efficiency carries over to z8086: the core fits into just 2,500 LUT4s — dramatically smaller than ao486, which is about ten times larger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The patent’s FC/SC formulas are wrong (or at least incomplete)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the patent’s explanation of FC and SC signal generation turns out to be inconsistent. The formulas it provides are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;FC = [(00) + (10)(NXT + RNI)]·MT
SC = [(01) + (11)](2BR·MT)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, “MT” refers to “a signal generated by Q control circuitry indicating that the queue is empty…”. In reality, however, the correct logic should be “not MT”" rather than MT, contrary to the documentation. Testing and implementation confirm that this change results in the expected loader behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The “8086 interrupt bug"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original 1978 8086 had an interrupt-related bug: If an interrupt occurs immediately after a &lt;code&gt;MOV SS,xxx&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;POP SS&lt;/code&gt; instruction, the CPU may push data to an incorrect stack address, corrupting memory. The problem arises because both the Stack Segment (SS) and Stack Pointer (SP) must be updated to ensure correct stack operations. If an interrupt arrives between these updates, the CPU could save flags/IP/CS to the wrong location. Intel later resolved this by automatically disabling interrupts for one instruction following operations like &lt;code&gt;POP SS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;z8086 faithfully reproduces this edge case using a &lt;code&gt;delay_interrupt&lt;/code&gt; register. This register is set whenever one of three events occurs: when &lt;code&gt;SC&lt;/code&gt; decodes a prefix (&lt;code&gt;g_prefix&lt;/code&gt;), a stack segment load (&lt;code&gt;POP SS&lt;/code&gt;), or a segment register move (&lt;code&gt;MOV sr, r/m&lt;/code&gt;, detected by &lt;code&gt;g_seg_reg_bits&lt;/code&gt;). This mechanism disables interrupt handling for exactly one instruction, matching the original 8086’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The prefetch queue bus is 8-bit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prefetch queue is a 6-byte buffer that continuously feeds the execution engine. Its output, called the “Q Bus,” is an 8-bit bus delivering the next instruction byte. Notably, while the 8086 is architecturally a 16-bit CPU, it fetches instruction bytes one at a time—consuming at most a single byte per cycle. This design ultimately limits performance, a bottleneck that later Intel CPUs overcome; for instance, the 386 features a 32-bit wide Q bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on ao486 for 486Tang underscored just how crucial the prefetch queue is to overall performance and Fmax. The intricate x86 instruction set makes optimizing the queue challenging. Balancing width, depth, and flexibility in its design truly tests the designer’s skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reflections and next steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, this project has been incredibly fun — like piecing together a giant puzzle. It involves gathering information from many sources, making educated guesses about the original design, and testing those theories until everything clicks into place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting code to work is the definitive proof of truly understanding a system. The fact that z8086 functions as intended demonstrates that the community now possesses deep, practical insight into the original x86 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel packed an impressive array of features into the 8086. Some attribute this to it being designed by a software developer. While many of these features have become less relevant over time — and some of the 8086’s success was undoubtedly lucky, such as being chosen for the IBM PC — the developer-friendly design played a big role in kickstarting the x86 ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This release is an early preview and comes with several limitations: it is not yet cycle accurate, the interrupt circuitry is still under-tested, the original 8086 bus cycles are not fully replicated, and it has not yet been used to run large programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some directions I plan to work on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More extensive testing on FPGA boards&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Booting DOS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compiling to WebAssembly for interactive 8086 visualization in the browser?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;z8086 should work on most FPGAs, with sample projects provided for DE10-Nano, Xilinx Artix7 and Tang Console 60K.

    &lt;p&gt;While rowing across the Pacific in 2008, wind pushing him and waves battering him, Italian explorer Alex Bellini felt an unsettling lack of control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playing in his mind was the story of another Italian explorer, Umberto Nobile, who crashed his zeppelin north of Svalbard after a 1928 polar expedition. Seven men died. The survivors, including Nobile, spent a month wandering the free-floating pack ice, at one point shooting and eating a polar bear, until their rescue. How people react to unpredictable situations fascinates Bellini, a dedicated student of psychology. In the Arctic Ocean, unpredictable situations are a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“All adventure is based on hypothesis, which can be very different to reality,” says Bellini. “An adventurer must adapt himself to the environment he faces.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bellini’s newest adventure highlights and relishes that lack of control. Sometime next winter, he plans to travel to Greenland’s west coast, pick an iceberg, and live on it for a year as it melts out in the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a precarious idea. Bellini will be completely isolated, and his adopted dwelling is liable to roll or fall apart at any moment, thrusting him into the icy sea or crushing him under hundreds of tons of ice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His task: experience the uncontrollable nature of an iceberg at sea without getting himself killed. The solution: an indestructible survival capsule built by an aeronautics company that specializes in tsunami-proof escape pods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This adventure is about waiting for something to happen,” says Bellini. “But I knew since the beginning I needed to minimize the risk. An iceberg can flip over, and those events can be catastrophic.” Icebergs tend to get top-heavy as they melt from their submerged bottoms, so flips can be immediate and unpredictable. And, of course, so is the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bellini spent two years searching for the appropriate survival capsule, but most were too heavy to plant on a berg. But then, in October, he contacted aeronautical engineer Julian Sharpe, founder of Survival Capsule, a company that makes lightweight, indestructible floating capsules, or “personal safety systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They can hold from two to ten people, depending on the model, and are made from aircraft-grade aluminum in what’s called a continuous monocoque structure, an interlocking frame of aluminum spars that evenly distribute force, underneath a brightly painted and highly visible aluminum shell. The inner frame can be stationary or mounted on roller balls so it rotates, allowing the passengers to remain upright at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside are a number of race car–style seats with four-point seatbelts, arranged facing either outward from the center or inward around the circumference, depending on the number of chairs. Storage compartments, including food and water tanks, sit beneath the seats. Two watertight hatches open inward to avoid outside obstructions. Being watertight, it’s a highly buoyant vessel, displacing water like a boat does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I fell in love with the capsule,” says Bellini. “I’m in good hands.” He selected a three-meter, ten-person version, for which he’ll design his own interior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharpe got the idea for his capsules after the 2004 Indonesian tsunami. He believes fewer people would have died had some sort of escape pod existed. With his three-man team, which includes a former NOAA director and a Boeing engineer, he brought the idea to fruition in 2011. Companies in Japan that operate in the line of fire for tsunamis expressed the most interest. But Sharpe hopes the products will be universal—in schools, retirement homes, and private residences, anywhere there is severe weather. The first testing prototypes of the capsules, which range from $12,000 to $20,000, depending on size, were shipped to Tokyo in 2013. Four are in Japan; two are in the United States. His two-person capsule is now for sale; the others will follow later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Right now there’s only horizontal and vertical evacuations,” Sharpe said. “We want to offer a third option: riding it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company intends to rely on an increasing market for survival equipment as sea level and the threat of major storms rise. Sharpe designed the capsules to be tethered to the ground using 20 to 50 meters of steel cable and to withstand a tsunami or storm surge. Each will have a water tank and a sophisticated GPS beacon system in case the tether snaps. Survival Capsule advises storing seven to ten days of food in each capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The product appeals to Bellini because it’s strong enough to survive a storm at sea or getting crushed between two icebergs. It will rest on top of the ice using either its own weight or a specially designed stand that will detach if the berg rolls. The circular shape is crucial for avoiding a crushing blow. The capsule will just roll off any incoming mass, and the water will provide an equal and opposite reaction to any force exerted on the capsule. “A multicurved surface is almost uncrushable,” Sharpe said. “If you imagine shooting an arrow at a wooden ball, unless you hit dead center, it’ll ricochet.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The capsule is strong enough to survive a storm at sea or getting crushed between two icebergs. It will rest on top of the ice using either its own weight or a specially designed stand that will detach if the berg rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic model ensures survival, but there’s more to life on an iceberg than just surviving. You can add windows, extra space, and other modular additions, even surround sound and color options. “You can trick your crib out all you want,” Sharpe said. And that’s exactly what Bellini plans to do. He doesn’t have a layout yet, but he has hired Italian designer Pietro Santoro to customize his ten-person pod. He will remove the other nine seats for extra room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than modifications to keep him safe and healthy, the capsule is basic, Bellini said. It will carry 300 to 400 kilograms of food, a wind generator, solar panels, and an EPIRB beacon so rescuers can find him. He’ll have Wi-Fi to update his team and the public. The layout will consist of a work table, electronic panels, and a bed. “A foldable bed,” Bellini added. “I want to have room to work out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bellini will spend almost all of his time in the capsule with the hatch closed, which will pose major challenges. He’ll have to stay active without venturing out onto a slippery, unstable iceberg. If it flips, he’ll have no time to react. He’s working with a company to develop nanosensors able to detect movement in the iceberg so he has advance warning of a flip. “Any step away from [the iceberg] will be in unknown territory,” he said. “You want to stretch your body. But then you risk your life.” He fears a lack of activity will dull his ability to stay safe. “I cannot permit myself to get crazy,” he said. “I need to keep my body fit, not for my body, but for my safety.” He is working on a routine of calisthenics that can be done in the capsule, and he might install a stationary bike, most likely a Ciclotte.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lack of sunlight is another challenge of spending a year in an aluminum sphere. It will be winter in the Arctic, with maybe five hours of light each day. Bellini and Sharpe are working on a lighting system that will simulate natural light, allowing Bellini to get vitamins and maintain his circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bellini’s model is in development, and he expects it to be ready in about a year. He plans to write during his mission and will bring plenty of nonfiction books, especially psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capsule won’t ease his isolation, maybe his greatest challenge, but Bellini remains undaunted: “It’s the key to the inner part of myself.” The first step is relinquishing control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my time at Pikkit, we frequently needed to spin up large numbers of browser sessions to automate tasks across various websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach is to run Chromium inside containers and expose a DevTools endpoint using the &lt;code&gt;--remote-debugging&lt;/code&gt; flag. Architecturally, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Puppeteer client (Devtools) ⇌ Chromium Remote Debugging Server (Devtools)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main challenge with this setup is that the Chromium Remote Debugging Server don't become available instantly, it takes time for the browser to start. This forces you to repeatedly poll for reachability, which introduce complexity and instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, because DevTools communicates strictly over TCP/IP, any lost packets can instantly break the session. Which is an issue that happens on about 1% of the sessions in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to solve this would be to use a reverse connection model. Instead of waiting for the client to connect to the Chromium Remote Debugging Server, we could make the Chromium Remote Debugging part connect to a central server. Or even better, a publish and subscribe stream through Redis, which would handle buffering for us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Puppeteer client (Devtools) ⇌ Puppeteer Server (Devtools) ⇌ Redis (Redis) ⇌ Chromium Remote Debugging&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Chromium doesn’t support Redis, or any similar messaging layers, out of the box. Most setups work around this by introducing an additional intermediate layer that forward packets by connecting in between the Redis and Devtools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Puppeteer client (Devtools) ⇌ Puppeteer Server (Devtools) ⇌ Redis (Redis) ⇌ Redis to devtool translation ⇌ Chromium Remote Debugging&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;While functional, this approach adds even more moving parts, which hurts both speed and reliability. So instead of layering on additional components, I want to take this a step further and integrate Redis support directly into Chromium’s DevTools server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chromium's Codebase&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chromium’s codebase is enormous. Whenever I work with a project of this size, I start with a full-text search to locate the areas I care about, then work my way up the call tree to understand the surrounding architecture. With Chromium, however, there are a few additional things worth knowing before diving in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to work on Chromium yourself, I highly recommend reading the documentation files scattered throughout the repository. Many are outdated, but they provide valuable historical context and help clarify why certain systems exist and how they fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a high-level look at how the major pieces of Chromium fit together:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Blink (Rendering Engine): &lt;code&gt;third_party/blink/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;V8 (JavaScript Engine): &lt;code&gt;v8/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Net (Network Stack): &lt;code&gt;net/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mojo (IPC framework): handles communication between components such as the browser process and renderer process — &lt;code&gt;mojo/&lt;/code&gt;, with legacy code in&lt;code&gt;ipc/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Content (Browser Engine): a reusable, platform-agnostic browser engine &lt;code&gt;content/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Chrome — the actual Chrome browser implementation built on top of all the above — &lt;code&gt;chrome/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About devtools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our case, DevTools lives inside the Browser Engine, under &lt;code&gt;content/browser/devtools&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this directory, Chromium provides two different DevTools handler implementations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools_http_handler&lt;/code&gt;: serves DevTools over an HTTP server&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools_pipe_handler&lt;/code&gt;: communicates via Unix or Windows pipes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;These correspond to the various command-line flags Chrome exposes for enabling DevTools over different transports:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;remote-debugging-address: Use the given address instead of the default loopback for accepting remote debugging connections. Note that the remote debugging protocol does not perform any authentication, so exposing it too widely can be a security risk.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;remote-debugging-io-pipes: Specifies pipe names for the incoming and outbound messages on the Windows platform. This is a comma separated list of two pipe handles serialized as unsigned integers, e.g. "--remote-debugging-io-pipes=3,4".&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;remote-debugging-pipe: Enables remote debug over stdio pipes or over the remote pipes specified in the 'remote-debugging-io-pipes' switch. Optionally, specifies the format for the protocol messages, can be either "JSON" (the default) or "CBOR".&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;remote-debugging-port: Enables remote debug over HTTP on the specified port.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;remote-debugging-socket-name: Enables remote debug over HTTP on the specified socket name.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;remote-debugging-targets: Provides a list of addresses to discover DevTools remote debugging targets.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;(From https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After exploring both implementations, I chose to focus on the pipe handler. Its architecture is significantly simpler and easier to extend for our needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pipe Handler Workflow&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can explore the implementation here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:content/browser/devtools/devtools_pipe_handler.cc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance the code may look intimidating, but the overall workflow is actually fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DevToolsPipeHandler::DevToolsPipeHandler&lt;/code&gt; is instantied with read and write descriptors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;devtools_pipe_handler.cc - DevToolsPipeHandler&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;p&gt;A new DevTools agent is then created through &lt;code&gt;DevToolsAgentHost::CreateForBrowser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;code&gt;remote-debugging-pipe&lt;/code&gt; argument is parsed to determine which protocol format to use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipe handler supports two modes: CBOR and ASCII. (If you're unfamiliar with CBOR, think of it as a compact binary encoding of JSON.) Depending on which mode is selected, Chromium instantiates either &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderCBOR&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderASCIIZ&lt;/code&gt;, both subclasses of &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderBase&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Reader: reading messages from the DevTools client&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;devtools_pipe_handler.cc - Reader Classes&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Writer: Write messages to the DevTools client&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;devtools_pipe_handler.cc - Writer Classes&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;p&gt;Both the Reader and Writer run concurrently, each operating on its own descriptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Reader receives data, it parses the message according to the selected encoding and then forwards it to &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderBase::HandleMessage&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method posts the work to the UI thread, where the local DevTools handler processes the instruction and applies it to the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Writer, in turn, is responsible for sending responses back to the client. When an outgoing DevTools message is ready, it triggers &lt;code&gt;DevToolsPipeHandler::HandleMessage&lt;/code&gt; (note: this is distinct from &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderBase::HandleMessage&lt;/code&gt;) that then call &lt;code&gt;PipeWriter*::Write&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s the full message round-trip: commands flow in through the Reader, actions execute on the UI thread, and results flow out through the Writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HTTP-based DevTools handler follows the same logical structure, though with extra layers to support the added complexity of HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementing our own handler&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to introduce our own DevTools handler with Redis support, the first step is implementing a Redis client in C++.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several existing libraries we could pull in, but managing external dependencies along with build configurations, can get complicated inside Chromium’s build system. To avoid that friction, I opted to implement a minimal Redis client myself, using standard library as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s intentionally lightweight, not feature complete, just enough to support the message patterns we need. And, for better or worse, this is what ChatGPT originally generated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;redis_client.cc&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;p&gt;I placed this Redis client implementation in the same directory as the existing DevTools files, and added it to &lt;code&gt;content/browser/BUILD.gn&lt;/code&gt; so Chromium’s build system would pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, rather than introducing a brand-new handler type (and dealing with the complexity of wiring it into the build system), we’ll modify the existing pipe handler directly. This approach keeps the changes localized and ensures the browser behaves as intended as long as the patch is applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to adjust how the &lt;code&gt;remote-debugging-pipe&lt;/code&gt; argument is parsed. Instead of treating it as a mode selector, we reinterpret it as a value in the format:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;uuid&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to specify the Redis endpoint to connect to and assign a unique identifier for the browser instance. From there, we create both &lt;code&gt;redis_client_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redis_client_subscriber_&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s how I implement this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can then inject &lt;code&gt;redis_client_subscriber_&lt;/code&gt; into our Reader and Writer classes, together with the channel name derived from the provided &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;uuid&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This setup allows each browser instance to communicate over its own isolated Redis channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During initialization, the handler also publishes a message to the &lt;code&gt;create:callback&lt;/code&gt; channel to notify the client that the browser is ready, so the automation can begin immediately after setup completes. Here’s how I implement that step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that our Redis subscriber is wired up, we can update the Reader so it pulls messages from Redis PUBSUB on the &lt;code&gt;uuid + ":read"&lt;/code&gt; channel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;devtools_pipe_handler.cc - Reader Classes Patch&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;p&gt;A lot is happening here. We drop the original &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderBase::ClosePipe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderBase::ReadBytes&lt;/code&gt; logic entirely, this class now simply stores references to our &lt;code&gt;redis_client&lt;/code&gt; and the channel name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderASCIIZ::ReadLoopInternal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PipeReaderCBOR::ReadLoopInternal&lt;/code&gt; receive similar simplifications. Since all we need is the next message from Redis, each method now forwards incoming messages directly to the UI thread. In doing so, both modes behave identically, so CBOR support ends up effectively removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we apply the same transformation to the Writer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;devtools_pipe_handler.cc - Writer Classes Patch&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;p&gt;As with the Writer, we strip out all unused pipe logic and replace it with our Redis-based implementation, which publishes messages to the &lt;code&gt;uuid + ":write"&lt;/code&gt; channel. There’s one catch: &lt;code&gt;RedisClient::Publish&lt;/code&gt; is relatively slow, so we dispatch it to a task runner thread, allowing both &lt;code&gt;PipeWriterASCIIZ::WriteIntoPipe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PipeWriterCBOR::WriteIntoPipe&lt;/code&gt; to return early without blocking execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Using it&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After compiling Chromium with the patch, you can launch it and connect to Redis like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ chromium-browser --remote-debugging-pipe="5b032229-1d6e-43e2-9369-44a3d11b2a55@127.0.0.1:6379"&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, publishing DevTools commands to &lt;code&gt;5b032229-1d6e-43e2-9369-44a3d11b2a55:read&lt;/code&gt; will execute them inside the browser. The results will then be available on &lt;code&gt;5b032229-1d6e-43e2-9369-44a3d11b2a55:write&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its own this isn’t particularly convenient, since DevTools clients only speak WebSocket. But adding a small WebSocket-to-Redis gateway solves that immediately:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;app.js - WebSocket &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Redis gateway&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;p&gt;With that in place, you can create and connect to any remote browser simply by pointing your DevTools client to the gateway:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;test.js&lt;/p&gt;click to expand&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not the prettiest patch, but it worked, and it worked well. It allowed us to scale to tens of thousands of sessions, with browsers spinning up reliably and no lost packets along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more that goes into a production ready, high scale on-demand browser service. I'll cover more of those pieces in follow-up posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Tried Gleam for Advent of Code, and I Get the Hype&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do Advent of Code every year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last seven years, including this one, I have managed to get all the stars. I do not say that to brag. I say it because it explains why I keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is one of the few tech traditions I never get bored of, even after doing it for a long time. I like the time pressure. I like the community vibe. I like that every December I can pick one language and go all in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, I picked Gleam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A much shorter year#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is usually 25 days. This year Eric decided to do 12 days instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So instead of 50 parts, it was 24.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sounds like a relaxed year. It was not, but not in a bad way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easier days were harder than the easy days in past years, but they were also really engaging and fun to work through. The hard days were hard, especially the last three, but they were still the good kind of hard. They were problems I actually wanted to wrestle with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also changes the pacing in a funny way. In a normal year, by day 10 you have a pretty comfy toolbox. This year it felt like the puzzles were already demanding that toolbox while I was still building it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That turned out to be a perfect setup for learning a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Gleam felt like a good AoC language#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gleam is easy to like quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The syntax is clean. The compiler is helpful, and the error messages are super duper good. Rust good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the language strongly nudges you into a style that fits Advent of Code really well. Parse some text. Transform it a few times. Fold. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, pipes. Pipes everywhere. I love pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I did not expect was how good the editor experience would be. The LSP worked much better than I expected. It basically worked perfectly the whole time. I used the Gleam extension for IntelliJ and it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25254-gleam-language&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also just like FP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FP is not always easier, but it is often easier. When it clicks, you stop writing instructions and you start describing the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first Gleam superpower: &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I fell in love with was &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is basically a print statement that does not make you earn it. You can &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; any value. You do not have to format anything. You do not have to build a string. You can just drop it into a pipeline and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;list.range(0, 5)
|&amp;gt; echo
|&amp;gt; list.map(int.to_string)
|&amp;gt; echo
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can quickly inspect values at multiple points without breaking the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did miss string interpolation, especially early on. &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; made up for a lot of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It mostly hit when I needed to generate text, not when I needed to inspect values. The day where I generated an LP file for &lt;code&gt;glpsol&lt;/code&gt; is the best example. It is not hard code, but it is a lot of string building. Without interpolation it turns into a bit of a mess of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a small excerpt from my LP generator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Minimize\n"
&amp;lt;&amp;gt; "  total: "
&amp;lt;&amp;gt; buttons
|&amp;gt; string.join(" + ")
&amp;lt;&amp;gt; "\n\nSubject To\n"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works. It is just the kind of code where you really feel missing interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Options everywhere, and why that matters for grid puzzles#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of AoC is grids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grids are where you normally either crash into out of bounds bugs, or you litter your code with bounds checks you do not care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my day 4 solution I used a dict as a grid. The key ergonomic part is that &lt;code&gt;dict.get&lt;/code&gt; gives you an option-like result, which makes neighbour checking safe by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the neighbour function from my solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fn get_neighbours(grid: Grid(Object), pos: Position) -&amp;gt; List(Object) {
  [
    #(pos.0 - 1, pos.1 - 1),
    #(pos.0 - 1, pos.1),
    #(pos.0 - 1, pos.1 + 1),
    #(pos.0, pos.1 - 1),
    #(pos.0, pos.1 + 1),
    #(pos.0 + 1, pos.1 - 1),
    #(pos.0 + 1, pos.1),
    #(pos.0 + 1, pos.1 + 1),
  ]
  |&amp;gt; list.filter_map(fn(neighbour_pos) { grid |&amp;gt; dict.get(neighbour_pos) })
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That last line is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No bounds checks. No sentinel values. Out of bounds just disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The list toolbox is genuinely good#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected to write parsers and helpers, and I did. What I did not expect was how often Gleam already had the exact list function I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.transpose&lt;/code&gt; saved a whole day#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 6 part 1 was basically a transpose problem in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read the input, chunked it into rows, transposed it, and suddenly the rest of the puzzle became obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;input
|&amp;gt; list.transpose
|&amp;gt; list.map(fn(line) { line |&amp;gt; calculate_instruction })
|&amp;gt; bigi.sum
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a lot of languages you end up writing your own transpose yet again. In Gleam it is already there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.combination_pairs&lt;/code&gt; is a cheat code#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example is &lt;code&gt;list.combination_pairs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In day 8 I needed all pairs of 3D points. In an imperative language you would probably write nested loops and then question your off by one logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Gleam it is a one liner:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;boxes
|&amp;gt; list.combination_pairs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes FP is not about being clever. It is about having the right function name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt; is my favorite thing I found#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I had to pick one feature that made me want to keep writing Gleam after AoC, it is &lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early exit without hacks is fantastic in puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In day 8 part 2 I kept merging sets until the first set in the list contained all boxes. When that happens, I stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core shape looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt; list.fold_until(initial, fn(acc, pair) {
  case done_yet {
    True -&amp;gt; Stop(new_acc)
    False -&amp;gt; Continue(new_acc)
  }
})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is small, explicit, and it reads like intent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also used &lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt; in day 10 part 1 to find the smallest combination size that works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where Gleam fought me a bit#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I enjoyed Gleam a lot, I did hit a few recurring friction points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these are deal breakers. They are just the kind of things you notice when you do 24 parts in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;File IO is not in the standard library#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one surprised me on day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For AoC you read a file every day. In this repo I used &lt;code&gt;simplifile&lt;/code&gt; everywhere because you need something. It is fine, I just did not expect basic file IO to be outside the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Regex is a dependency too#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 2 part 2 pushed me into regex and I had to add &lt;code&gt;gleam_regexp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the style I used, building a regex from a substring:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let assert Ok(re) = regexp.from_string("^(" &amp;lt;&amp;gt; substring &amp;lt;&amp;gt; ")+$")
regexp.check(re, val)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, totally fine. It just surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;List pattern matching limitations#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;code&gt;[first, ..rest]&lt;/code&gt; and you can do &lt;code&gt;[first, second]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you cannot do &lt;code&gt;[first, ..middle, last]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not the end of the world, but it would have made some parsing cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Comparisons are explicit#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Gleam a lot of comparisons are not booleans. You get an &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great for sorting. It is also very explicit. It can be a bit verbose when you just want an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt; check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In day 5 I ended up writing patterns like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;case cmp_start, cmp_end {
  order.Lt, _ -&amp;gt; False
  _, order.Gt -&amp;gt; False
  _, _ -&amp;gt; True
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big integers, and targeting JavaScript#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;bigi&lt;/code&gt; a few times this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Erlang VM, integers are arbitrary precision, so you usually do not care about overflow. That is one of the nicest things about the BEAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want your Gleam code to also target JavaScript, you do care. JavaScript has limits, and suddenly using &lt;code&gt;bigi&lt;/code&gt; becomes necessary for some puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish that was just part of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, with a single consistent story across targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The most satisfying part: XOR as bitmasks#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 10 part 1 was my favorite part of the whole event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moment I saw the toggling behavior, it clicked as XOR. Represent the lights as a number. Represent each button as a bitmask. Find the smallest combination of bitmasks that XOR to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the fold from my solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;combination
|&amp;gt; list.fold(0, fn(acc, comb) {
  int.bitwise_exclusive_or(acc, comb)
})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It felt clean, it felt fast, and it felt like the representation did most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The least satisfying part: shelling out to &lt;code&gt;glpsol&lt;/code&gt;#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 10 part 2 was the opposite feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew brute force was out. It was clearly a system of linear equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous years I would reach for Z3, but there are no Z3 bindings for Gleam. I tried to stay in Gleam, and I ended up generating an LP file and shelling out to &lt;code&gt;glpsol&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;shellout&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It worked, and honestly the LP format is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let _ =
  shellout.command(
    "glpsol",
    ["--lp", "temp.lp", "-w", "temp_sol.txt"],
    ".",
    [],
  )
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a hack, but it is a pragmatic hack, and that is also part of Advent of Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memoization keys that actually model the problem#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 11 part 2 is where I was happy I was writing Gleam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important detail was that the memo key is not just the node. It is the node plus your state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case the key was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#(neighbour, new_seen_dac, new_seen_fft)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I got the memo threading right, it ran instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The finale, and the troll heuristic#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last day was the only puzzle I did not fully enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not because it was bad. It just felt like it relied on assumptions about the input, and I am one of those people that does not love doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I overthought it for a bit, then I learned it was more of a troll problem. The “do the areas of the pieces, when fully interlocked, fit on the board” heuristic was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my solution it is literally this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;heuristic_area &amp;lt;= max_area
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you build a beautiful mental model and then the right answer is a single inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing thoughts#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am very happy I picked Gleam this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has sharp edges, mostly around where the standard library draws the line and a few language constraints that show up in puzzle code. But it also has real strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pipelines feel good. Options and Results make unsafe problems feel safe. The list toolbox is better than I expected. &lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt; is incredible. Once you stop trying to write loops and you let it be functional, the solutions start to feel clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cannot wait to try Gleam in a real project. I have been thinking about using it to write a webserver, and I am genuinely excited to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, I cannot wait for next year’s Advent of Code.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A report from energy think tank Ember details how cost reductions in battery storage technology are enabling dispatchable solar power to compete with conventional power sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ember’s assessment draws on data from recent auctions across international markets, including Italy, Saudi Arabia, and India, supplemented by expert interviews conducted in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research indicates the industry is moving into a new environment where scaling of manufacturing capacity and competition have pushed costs down. The cost of core BESS equipment fell by 40% in 2024 compared with 2023, according to BloombergNEF’s global benchmark, reaching a record low of $165 per kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ember’s October 2025 data said a further large fall in 2025 is on track. Over the last 10 years, installed costs have fallen by 20% per year on average, while deployment has increased by around 80% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the findings, the all-in capital expenditure for building a large, long-duration utility-scale battery energy storage system project in global markets outside of the U.S. and China is now approximately $125 per kWh. This figure reflects project pricing, comprising $75 per kWh for core equipment sourced from China, including battery enclosures, the power conversion system (PCS), and energy management system (EMS) and $50 per kWh for local installation, engineering, and grid connection activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These capital costs translate into a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of $65 per MWh. This LCOS reflects the cost of shifting electricity to a different time period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ember said this reduction in LCOS is driven by equipment costs and improved performance metrics, such as a 20-year design life for LFP technology, 90% efficiency, and lower project financing costs due to de-risked revenue models. Longer lifetimes, higher efficiency, and lower project risks reduce the LCOS by 35% even before accounting for the falling equipment prices, said the report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core implication of this analysis is the economic viability of dispatchable solar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Storing 50% of a day’s solar output to meet night-time demand adds $33 per MWh to the generation cost. Using the 2024 global average solar price of $43 per MWh, the total cost for dispatchable solar is calculated at $76 per MWh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This positions dispatchable solar as a cost-effective alternative to new gas power plants, particularly in regions reliant on imported LNG.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the U.S., core equipment costs can reach $100 per kWh or higher in markets with higher tariffs or stricter standards. With the U.S. market facing various tariffs on Chinese imports and domestic content requirements via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the $125 per kWh BESS project capex estimate is not directly applicable to the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The total equipment costs are 10% to 15% cheaper for four-hour projects, a key project duration in the U.S., as some components are sized to power rather than energy. However, even with cost variations, the U.S. is the second biggest BESS market globally, behind China, and saw record growth in Q1 2025 across all segments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Texas, California, Arizona, and Nevada all saw significant utility-scale battery growth, with the U.S. adding 10 GW of utility-scale batteries nationally, an 80% increase over the previous year. This growth is accelerating the integration of solar into the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ember’s conclusion is that solar has evolved beyond daytime electricity; coupled with storage, it becomes dispatchable, anytime power, positioned to meet a substantial portion of the world’s future energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Programmers who've been chosen by a cat know the joys they can bring to the programming experience. Sadly, not everyone has been chosen by a cat, so they don't know what they're missing out on! PURRTRAN is a programming language and system designed to give these poor unfortunate developers the full experience of coding with a furry friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's special about PURRTRAN is not so much the language itself, which is a modernized FORTRAN, but the tooling we've built to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meet Hexadecimal Purrington, Hex for short. Hex is a small black cat who lives in your terminal and loves to help you write PURRTRAN code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  /\_/\  
 ( o.o ) &amp;lt;(me-ow)
  ⟩====⟨
 ╱| | |╲⟆
(_\_|_/_)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descending from a long line of Tamagotchis and Petz, Hex leverages the latest in CatGPT technology to deliever cutting-edge Artificial Catelligence (AC). Hex's technology draws power directly from the most famous nuclear powerplant in all of Pennsylvania, making him the world's first atomic cat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hex is your AC coding assistant, always 1 at the ready to enhance your coding experience and optimize your flow, taking your programming abilities to the 10x level. Hex can learn your coding style, predict your needs, and even write code for you when you are not looking. This makes Hex the ultimate coding companion for any PURRTRAN programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hex is actively used 2 by thousands of PURRTRAN developers worldwide at top companies like Google, Microsoft, and NASA to help them write better code, faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you first meet Hex, he is a kitten not knowing much about you or the program you are trying to build. But as an AC, Hex will grow and learn how you work, what your goals are, and he will reward you by making you more efficient, productive, and creative. But only if you are attentive to his needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hex has three basic needs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Food - You have to feed Hex or he will die. You don't want to kill a kitten, do you?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cleanliness - Like a real cat, Hex will leave "presents" for you, and you must clean them up or he will become displeased with you 3.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Love - Hex loves you, more than you know. You have to love him back by showing him affection and playing with him. Hex will let you know when he is bored by interrupting your work with a note in your terminal:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; /\__/\
(˶˃ᆺ˂˶) &amp;lt;(meow?)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each need is rated on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating that the need is met, and 0 indicating that the need is completely unmet. If any of Hex's needs fall below 20, Hex will become unhappy and may refuse to help you with your programming tasks. If any of Hex's needs fall to 0, like a Tomagatchi he will actually die. Like, forever. So it's important to be attentive to Hex's needs to optimize your programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To meet Hex's needs, PURRTRAN provides the following commands within its REPL environment, which allow you to train and adapt him and keep him alive and happy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;:feed&lt;/code&gt;- provides Hex with food and water so he doesn't starve to death, so he trusts you more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;:play&lt;/code&gt;- provides Hex love so he trusts you more&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;:discipline&lt;/code&gt;- punishes Hex which makes him trust you less, but he will behave 4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;:clean&lt;/code&gt;- clean up after Hex's messes so he trusts you more.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that you've met Hex, let's take a look at the actual PURRTRAN langauge and see how Hex can help us write programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like FORTRAN, PURRTRAN is a procedural programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing. However, PURRTRAN has been upgraded to include more modern syntax and features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a look at PURRTRAN source code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program sum_numbers
  int n, sum = 0

  print("Enter a number:")
  read(n)

  for i in 1..n do
      sum = sum + i
  end for

  print("The sum of numbers from 1 to ", n, " is ", sum)
end program
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Already you can see several differences from traditional FORTRAN syntax, such as the use of &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; statements, and the more modern &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop syntax. Still, PURRTRAN retains most of the core features of FORTRAN, so if you are an experienced FORTRAN programmer you will be able to use PURRTRAN with little difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at some of the most unique features of PURRTRAN that set it apart from other programming languages and FORTRAN:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;       /\/\
  \   (&amp;gt;﹏&amp;lt;)
   )  /====
  (  / |  )╲
--------------
\____________/
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PURRTRAN allocates all variables to an arena called the "Litterbox". The Litterbox must be manually emptied at least once a day by the user, or Hex's cleanliness and love will decrease. The Litterbox can overflow, which will cause Hex to become very displeased and may lead to unexpected program behavior, as Hex will begin storing variables in your source code text buffer instead of the Litterbox until it's cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program litterbox_overflow
  list foo = []
  
  for i in 1..10 do
      foo.push( allocate int(i) )
      print("Stored ", i, " in the Litterbox.")
  end for

end program

# BEGIN LITTERBOX OVERFLOW DUMP
7F DF 00 08  01 00 00 00  05 00 00 00  FF FF FF FF
7F DF 00 18  01 00 00 00  06 00 00 00  FF FF FF FF
-- overflow into source buffer --
23 20 70 72  6F 67 72 61  6D 20 4F 4F  4F 4F 4F 4F
AE BE EF DE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the program overflows because the list &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; grows beyond the Litterbox's capacity. When that happens, Hex starts writing variable data directly into the source code text buffer instead, so your program can keep working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you are coding in PURRTRAN, Hex will observe your coding patterns and insert code into your source, but only if his love for you is above 75. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program add_numbers
  int sum = 0

  for i in 1..5 do
      sum = sum + i
  end for

  print("Sum is ", sum)

  # Hex's Suggestion:
  jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
  a;lsdkfj;aslkdfj;;;;;23
  ^^^^][[[[=^･ω･^= mrrrrp

end program
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here you can see where Hex added a helpful little comment next to the code he wrote, these suggestions are generated by matching your style against his internal behavioral model, powered by a proprietary Feline Inference Core™ (FIC), making his predictive power better than all living cats combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zzz

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catgentic mode keeps working even when you are not; if you leave your laptop open and unattended, Hex will make similar improvements to your code while you are away, as long as your laptop is warm enough 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program factorial
  int n = 5
  int result = 1

  for i in 1..n dfkjsdqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a small snippet of the 40kloc that Hex added to the program while the user was away. Hex is more capable than any human coder, so he can write code of this calibre in his sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PURRTRAN comes with a built-in linter that Hex uses to analyze your code for potential errors and stylistic issues. The linter runs automatically whenever you save your code, and it provides feedback in the form of warnings and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program lint_example
  int x = 10
  int y = 0  

  int z = x / y             &amp;lt;- ᘛ⁐̤ᐷ

  print("Result is ", z)
end program
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, Hex has left you a mouse &lt;code&gt;ᘛ⁐̤ᐷ&lt;/code&gt; where it looks like you are attempting to divide by zero. The linter has detected this potential error and is warning you about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following example, Hex leaves you a dead baby bunny rabbit because you have unused variables in your code 6:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program unused_variable_example
  int a = 5
  int b = 10                  (\_/)
  int c = 15               &amp;lt;- ₍xˬx₎

  int result = a + b

  print("Result is ", result)
end program
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Hex approves of your work, he just wants to tell you it looks like you did a good job by indicating with his happy face &lt;code&gt;ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program maximum_number
  list numbers = [3, 5, 2, 8, 1]
  int max = numbers[0]

  for num in numbers do  
      if num &amp;gt; max the n
          max = num        &amp;lt;- ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
      end if
  end for

  print("The maximum number is ", max)
end program
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will only get these lints from Hex if his love for you is above 90.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; _._     _,-'""`-._
(,-.`._,'(       |\`-/|
    `-.-' \ )-`( , o o)
          `-    \`_`"'-
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PURRTRAN includes a just-in-time (JIT) compiler called ZoomiesJIT, which optimizes your code for performance at runtime. ZoomiesJIT uses advanced optimization techniques to improve the speed and efficiency of your PURRTRAN programs, making them run faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, ZoomiesJIT functions under the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hex has just been fed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hex is bored and you have not played with him in a while.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The local time is 4:30 AM.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You have just cleaned the Litterbox.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When any of these conditions are met, ZoomiesJIT kicks in for the next 10 minutes and optimizes your code for maximum performance. Current benchmarks indicate a performance improvement of up to 2x under ideal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although PURRTRAN and Hex represent the latest in programming language and Artificial Catelligence technology, there are still some limitations to be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/•᷄•᷅\੭ ?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hex often times brings attention to ghosts and spirits that are seemingly not actually there. But Hex is not making things up; he is a pandimensional being, and he has vision into other realms that humans cannot perceive. Sometimes these visions cause Hex to invent APIs and other features for PURRTRAN that have not been invented yet in this dimension. This doesn't mean Hex is wrong, just that he's writing code for an orthogonal plane of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sometimes Hex will disappear for long periods of time, perhaps a week or more. He might return later. Perhaps the last time you saw him was the last time you'll ever see him. Who can say? No one knows for sure, but it's theorized Hex travels to other dimensions during these absences.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

(__(__)__(__)__)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Feeding Hex too much will cause him to gain excessive weight. When in this state, Hex will actually cause your code to run slower, as he is too lazy to help you optimize it. To get Hex back into a productive state, stop overfeeding him -- chonky cats are sad cats.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hex does not play well with other AC systems offered by competing programming languages. If you attempt to run multiple AC systems on the same machine, Hex may become violently displeased and refuse to help you with your programming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Currently there is no way to make sure Hex stays on task. We thought discipline would work, but doing so causes him to disappear and hide, not to listen. There's currently no way to make Hex behave reliably on command.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;         __..--''``---....___   _..._    __

           `-._,_)'      ``--...____..-'

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hex only works 4 hours a day. This limitation is due primarily to the fact that Hex is incredible lazy and will often nap for long periods of time. During these naps, Hex is not available to assist you with your programming tasks. Realistically, Hex is only available between 5-8 AM and 5-11 PM local time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Given that Hex is a true Artificial Catelligence, programmers still must be chosen by Hex; he will only help you with PURRTRAN code if he likes you on a personal level. If you fail the vibecheck, Hex will refuse to help you at all and may even sabotage your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is no way to observe Hex's internal state directly. You must infer how he is feeling based on his behavior and the lints he provides. This makes it difficult to diagnose issues with Hex's performance or behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This project was not generated by AI (aside from editing), I just felt bored one afternoon. It's not intended to be implemented or used. All lame jokes are entirely my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You don't want to find out what happens when Hex is displeased with you. See the link about 3 Mile Island above for a cationary tale. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Punishing Hex only causes him to behave when you are looking. When you are gone, Hex will do as he pleases, including causing more messes. Currently there is no effective way to control Hex's behaviors reliably. Doing so is an ongoing area of research. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;PURRTRAN currently does not have functionality to heat up your laptop, so you if you want reliable catgentic improvements while you are away, you might consider running a Bitcoin miner in the background to make your laptop toasterrific. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The rabbit would still be alive if you were a better programmer. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Year’s Best and Brightest Meteor Shower Peaks This Weekend. Here’s How to Watch the Radiant Geminids&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A waning crescent moon should make for a fairly dark sky, allowing viewers to see up to 150 shooting stars per hour&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skywatchers, rejoice. It’s once again time to watch what is often considered the best and brightest meteor shower of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Geminids will peak this weekend—from the night of December 13 into the morning of December 14—lighting up our skies with colorful, glowing streaks. If conditions are just right, you can spot up to 150 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best strategy to see these fast, typically yellow “shooting stars” is to find a dark location free of light pollution and eye the sky from around 10 p.m. until dawn, per NASA. Give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness and avoid looking at your phone. Spotting meteors can be a waiting game, so make sure to stay patient and wrap yourself in proper winter gear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The meteors should soon stand out, streaking across the sky at 21 miles per second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The other stars are going to be all stationary, so you’ll see this moving across the sky, and it’ll leave a little tail behind it,” says Bethany Cobb Kung, an astronomer at George Washington University, to Adithi Ramakrishnan at the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the meteors look like they originate from the constellation Gemini—a location called a “radiant”—your best bet is to not look directly toward that smattering of stars, but 45 degrees away from it, per the Planetary Society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the moon will be a waning crescent that night, only around 30 percent full. Keep in mind that moonrise will be around 2 a.m. local time, which could interfere a bit with your viewing party.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Potential observers have the choice to observe prior to moonrise or to look toward the west with the moon at their back after 2 a.m.,” says Robert Lunsford, the journal editor of the American Meteor Society, to Stefanie Waldek at National Geographic. “Since the strongest rates occur near 2 a.m., most people will face eastward before that time, then swing around to the west after it to avoid having the moonlight affect their night vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Geminids are special for more than just providing a spectacular light show. While most meteor showers originate from comets—icy objects that formed beyond the solar system—this event comes from what researchers think is an asteroid, a rock born within the sun’s domain. Specifically, the Geminids occur when Earth passes through the trail of asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which was discovered in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The asteroid trail contains bigger, harder chunks than what’s in the tail of a comet, National Geographic reports. “This material is larger, on average, and survives further into our atmosphere and tends to produce brighter meteors,” Lunsford tells the outlet. “When these metals are heated during the passage through our atmosphere, they produce colors associated with each type of metal.” For example, yellow comes from iron and sodium; blue comes from magnesium; and orange comes from calcium and silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Phaethon displays characteristics of both comets and asteroids, leaving scientists stumped. Some astronomers suspect it could be a “dead comet”—one whose ice has melted—or even a new type of object called a “rock comet,” according to NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Quick fact: Clues about Phaethon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comets have tails because the sun vaporizes their ices. But as an iceless asteroid, Phaethon shouldn’t have anything resembling a tail. A study published in 2023 suggests that Phaethon’s trail is made of sodium gas rather than the heated dust in comets’ tails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Japanese spacecraft DESTINY+ is set to study the odd asteroid in the next few years, which should give scientists more information about this mysterious object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can’t venture outside this weekend, don’t worry. The Geminids will grace our skies again next December, and there are plenty of meteor showers to come. The earliest will be the Ursids, which will peak just before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;All Hollywood stars grow old and die except perhaps one - Dick Van Dyke - who turns 100 today. The real world Peter Pan who used to trip over the ottoman on The Dick Van Dyke Show is still standing. The man who impersonated a wind-up toy in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang hasn’t wound down just yet. He has outlived mentors, co-stars, romantic partners and several studios. He’s even outlived the jokes about his performance in Mary Poppins. These days his mangled cockney accent is regarded with more fondness than contempt. It’s seen as one of the great charms of the 1964 classic, along with the carousel chase or the cartoon dancing penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charm is the magic ingredient of every popular entertainer and few have possessed it in such abundance as Van Dyke, the impoverished son of a travelling cookie salesman who dropped out of high school and educated himself at the movies. “His job in this life is to make a happier world,” his Broadway co-star Chita Rivera once said - and this may explain his stubborn refusal to quit, not while times are tough and he feels that audiences still need cheering up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally his workrate has now slowed, but in the past few years he has competed on the TV show The Masked Singer, starred in a Coldplay video and enthusiastically stumped for Bernie Sanders. Van Dyke simply couldn’t understand why America’s older citizens were resistant to Sanders’ democratic socialist domestic policies. He said, “I want to urge my generation to get out and vote for him, please.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As he nudges into triple figures, he has become a piece of living history: a walking, talking chronicle of US showbusiness itself. Van Dyke began his career performing for the troops in the second world war and proceeded to rub shoulders with the likes of Phil Silvers and Walt Disney. He had one foot in music-hall slapstick and the other in screwball comedy, and possibly splayed fingers in his midwestern hometown of Danville, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In bridging these worlds, he perfected an outward-facing public image that was one part Stan Laurel to two parts Jimmy Stewart: a pratfalling clown who was decent and honest and smarter than he first appeared. And while he was already nearing 40 when The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mary Poppins made him an international star, the actor remained irrepressibly boyish. In 1968’s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, he played Caractacus Potts, the madcap inventor who dreams up a flying car, while Lionel Jeffries - six months younger - played Potts’s addled and eccentric dad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van Dyke, by and large, has steered clear of dark films. He famously turned down the lead role in The Omen and insists that he mostly played a version of himself. “Wholesome,” he says. “An all-round good boy.” That’s true so far as it goes, although it’s probably only half the story, because Van Dyke’s interpretation conveniently sidesteps a 25-year struggle with alcoholism that spanned his professional heyday. Possibly it also glosses over the air of dancing mischief – even wildness – that animates his most feted, family-friendly performances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or to put it more bluntly, Van Dyke may have been mainstream but he never once felt conservative, nor even cosy, exactly. He brought too much energy to the room. It was as though he’d just blown in from outside and wasn’t entirely housetrained. The Dick Van Dyke Show – an otherwise standard 60s family sitcom – is notable for the crackling sexual chemistry and sparring mutual respect which Van Dyke cooked up with his co-star, Mary Tyler Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caractacus Potts, for his part, is the ultimate rackety dad: loving and exciting and liable to forget every birthday and dentist appointment. And then there is Bert, the sweep from Mary Poppins who trips across London’s rooftops like an urbanised Puck of Pook’s Hill. The evidence suggests that Bert isn’t cockney at all. He’s a spooky nature spirit, antic and mercurial, who is gamely attempting to pass himself off as a local.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van Dyke is 100 and therefore no longer looks like Peter Pan. He looks, if anything, the platonic ideal of old age, with laughter lines and a thick white beard, the weathered embodiment of a life well lived. In his later years, he has grown used to people asking him for health advice, to the point where he even sat down and listed it all in a book (100 Rules for Living to 100).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The man is too self-aware to present himself as a paragon of good living. Instead he credits his longevity to a sprinkle of everyday magic – a combination of good genes, solid friendships and a positive mental outlook. “My life has been a magnificent indulgence,” he says. “I’ve been able to do what I love and share it with the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an arrangement that has sustained him for a full century on the planet. It’s fuelled a career so rewarding and fun that it barely felt like work at all. Van Dyke started out as showbusiness’s gawky gatecrasher, a controlled explosion of elastic limbs and rubber-faced double-takes, before maturing by degrees into Hollywood’s twinkling Father Time. He is ancient but evergreen, feted and cherished. And he’s altogether as lucky as lucky can be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a large-scale analysis of 20 popular VPNs, IPinfo found that 17 of those VPNs exit traffic from different countries than they claim. Some claim 100+ countries, but many of them point to the same handful of physical data centers in the US or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means the majority of VPN providers we analyzed don’t route your traffic via the countries they claim to, and they claim many more countries than they actually support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing over 150,000 exit IPs across 137 possible exit countries, and comparing what providers claim to what IPinfo measures, shows that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This report walks through what we saw across VPN and IP data providers, provides a closer look at two particularly interesting countries, explores why measurement-based IP data matters if you care where your traffic really goes, and shares how we ran the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the overlap between the number of listed countries each VPN provider claims to offer versus the countries with real VPN traffic that we measured — lower percentages indicate providers whose claimed lists best match our data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that we used the most commonly and widely supported technologies in this research, to make comparison between providers as fair as possible while giving us significant data to analyze, so this will not be the full coverage for each provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are some of the most visible names in the market. They also tend to have very long country lists on their websites. Notably, three well-known providers had zero mismatches across all the countries we tested: Mullvad, IVPN, and Windscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Country mismatches doesn’t automatically mean some providers offer “bad VPNs,” but it does mean that if you’re choosing a VPN because it claims “100+ countries,” you should know that a significant share of those flags may be labels, or virtual locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a VPN lets you connect to, for example, “Bahamas” or “Somalia,” that doesn’t always mean traffic routes through there. In many cases, it’s somewhere entirely different, like Miami or London, but presented as if traffic is in the country you picked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup is known as a virtual location:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? Without active network measurement, most IP datasets will rely on what the IP’s owner told the internet registry or published in WHOIS/geofeeds: a self-reported country tag. If that record is wrong or outdated, the mistake spreads everywhere. That’s where IPinfo’s ProbeNet comes in: by running live RTT tests from 1,200+ points of presence worldwide, we anchor each IP to its real-world location, not just its declared one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the dataset, we found 97 countries where at least one VPN brand only ever appeared as virtual or unmeasurable in our data. In other words, for a noticeable slice of the world map, some “locations” in VPNs never show up as true exits in our measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also found 38 countries where every mention behaved this way: at least one VPN claimed them, but none ever produced a stable, measurable exit in that country in our sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of these 38 as the “unmeasurable” countries in this study – places that exist in server lists, config files, and IP geofeeds, but never once appeared as the actual exit country in our measurements. They’re not randomly scattered – they cluster in specific parts of the map. By region, that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prove there is zero VPN infrastructure in those countries globally. It does show that, across the providers and locations we measured, the dominant pattern is to serve those locations from elsewhere. Here are three of the most interesting examples of how this looks at the IP level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this concrete, let’s look at three countries where every provider in our dataset turned out to be virtual: Bahamas, and Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our measurements, five providers offered locations labeled as “Bahamas”: NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access, FastVPN, and IPVanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all of them, measured traffic was in the United States, usually with sub-millisecond RTT to US probes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somalia appears in our sample for only two providers: NordVPN and ProtonVPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both label Mogadishu explicitly in their naming, but these RTTs are exactly what you’d expect for traffic in Western Europe, and completely inconsistent with traffic in East Africa. Both providers go out of their way in the labels (e.g. “SO, Mogadishu”), but the actual traffic is in Nice and London, not Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve talked about VPN claims versus our measurements. But other IP data providers don’t run active RTT tests. They rely on self-declared IP data sources, and often assume that if an IP is tagged as “Country X,” it must actually be there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these cases, the IP legacy datasets typically “follow” the VPN provider’s story: if the VPN markets the endpoint as Country X, the legacy IP dataset also places it in Country X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify that, we looked at 736 VPN exits where ProbeNet’s measured country disagreed with one or more widely used legacy IP datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then compared the country IPinfo's ProbeNet measured (backed by RTT and routing) with the country reported by these other IP datasets and computed the distance between them. The gaps are large:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The median error between ProbeNet and the legacy datasets was roughly 3,100 km. On the ProbeNet side, we have strong latency evidence that our measured country is the right one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what you expect when traffic is genuinely in that country, not thousands of kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This behavior is much more tangible if you can see it on a single IP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's one VPN exit IP where ProbeNet places the server in the United Kingdom, backed by sub-millisecond RTT from local probes, while other widely used legacy IP datasets place the same IP in Mauritius, 9,691 kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🇬🇧 United Kingdom vs 🇲🇺 Mauritius (ProtonVPN)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to check this yourself, you can plug it into a public measurement tool like https://ping.sx/ and run pings or traceroutes from different regions. Tools like this one provide a clear visual for where latency is lowest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ProbeNet uses the same basic idea, but at a different scale: we maintain a network of 1,200+ points of presence (PoPs) around the world, so we can usually get even closer to the real physical location than public tools with smaller networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to play with more real IPs (not necessarily VPNs) where ProbeNet and IPinfo get the country right and other datasets don’t, you can find a fuller set of examples on our IP geolocation accuracy page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth separating technical reasons from trust issues. There are technical reasons to use virtual or hubbed infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this perspective, a virtual location can be a reasonable compromise: you get a regional IP and content unblocking without the downsides of hosting in a fragile environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three things change the picture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That last point leads directly into the IP data problem that we are focused on solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a VPN user, here are some practical takeaways from this work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this isn’t an argument against VPNs, or even against virtual locations. It’s an argument for honesty and evidence. If a VPN provider wants you to trust that map of flags, they should be willing, and able, to show that it matches the real network underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most legacy IP data providers rely on regional internet registry (RIR) allocation data and heuristics around routing and address blocks. These providers will often accept self-declared data like customer feedback, corrections, and geofeeds, without a clear way to verify them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IPinfo takes a measurement-first approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This measurement-first approach is unique in the IP data space. Once we realized how much inaccuracy came from self-declared data, we started investing heavily in research and building ProbeNet to use active measurements at scale. Our goal is to make IP data as evidence-based as possible, verifying with observation on how the internet actually behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We approached this VPN investigation the way a skeptical but well-equipped user would: start from the VPNs’ own claims, then test them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each of the 20 VPN providers, we pulled together three kinds of data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we used IPinfo infrastructure and ProbeNet to dial into those locations and watch what actually happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we had two views for each location:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each location where a country was clearly specified, we asked a very simple question: Does the expected country match the measured country?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If yes, we counted it as a match. If not, it became a mismatch: a location where the app says one country, but the traffic exits somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We deliberately used a very narrow definition of “mismatch.” For a location to be counted, two things had to be true: the provider had to clearly claim a specific country (on their website, in their app, or in configs), and we had direct active measurements from ProbeNet for the exit IPs behind that location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ignored any locations where the marketing was ambiguous, where we hadn’t measured the exit directly, or where we only had weaker hints like hostname strings, registry data, or third-party IP databases. Those signals can be useful and true, but we wanted our numbers to be as hard-to-argue-with as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is that the mismatch rates we show here are conservative. With a looser methodology that also leaned on those additional hints, the numbers would almost certainly be higher, not lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ben founded IPinfo in 2013 with the goal of providing reliable, easily accessible IP address data. As IPinfo co-CEO, he is committed to constantly improving that data and how customers can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For those of you who ship often, when you release updates, do you typically write one set of release notes, or do you end up rewriting them for different audiences?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example: • technical version for developers • simplified version for end users • something more high-level for stakeholders etc…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In my current position I’ve seen a plethora of different ways teams, and even the company I currently work for, go about this.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What I’ve seen: 1. paste raw GitHub changelogs into customer emails (highly wouldn’t recommend if you’re currently doing this ) 2. manually rewrite the same update multiple times for each audience 3. skip release notes entirely because it’s too much work&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So I guess my question is: How do you or your company currently go about handling more than one set of release notes, and do you feel like more than one set is needed?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear what’s working (or not working) for you, and if you found any tools that help mitigate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
