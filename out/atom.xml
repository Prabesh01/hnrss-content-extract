  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love C. I could give you rational reasons for that. Like the fact that it works everywhere and how it goes fast. But mostly I love C because when I write C I feel an intimate connection with my computer. To me, C has soul. In fact all my personal project are written in C, like the graphics rendering engines that I'm currently writing. The problem is that C is dangerous and sharing new C projects to wider audiences is borderline malicious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today on hacker news a cool little web framework written in C was posted. As a security researcher I'm always trying to sharpen my skills so I thought I'd given the app a look. And yup sure enough, there's memory safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;HttpParser parseRequest(char *request) {
    HttpParser parser = {
        .isValid = true,
        .requestBuffer = strdup(request), // [0]
        .requestLength = strlen(request),
        .position = 0,
    };

    // ... irrelevant stuff

    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; parser.request.headerCount; i++) {
        if (strcasecmp(parser.request.headers[i].name, "Content-Length") == 0) {
            parser.request.bodyLength = atoi(parser.request.headers[i].value); // [1]
            break;
        }
    }
    
    parser.request.body = malloc(parser.request.bodyLength + 1); // [2]
    for (int i = parser.position; i &amp;lt; parser.position + parser.request.bodyLength; i++) {
        parser.request.body[i - parser.position] = parser.requestBuffer[i]; // [3]
    }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;line [1] takes Content-Length off the http packet. This is a non validated value basically straight from the socket. line [2] allocates based on that size. Line [3] copies data into that buffer based on that size. But it's copying out of a buffer of any size. So passing a &lt;code&gt;Content-Length&lt;/code&gt; Larger than the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; sent in will start copying heap data into the &lt;code&gt;parser.request.body&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another interesting choice in this project is to make lengths signed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    //...

    int        headerCount;
    int        headerCapacity;

    //...
    int        bodyLength;
} HttpRequest;

typedef struct {
    // ...
    
    int         position;
    //...
    int         requestLength;
} HttpParser;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to have a negative &lt;code&gt;headerCount&lt;/code&gt; or negative of anything here? Maybe there is a valid meaning, but we need to ask ourselves that question. Going back to the original code sample. A malicious user can pass &lt;code&gt;Content-Length&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;4294967295&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;malloc(parser.request.bodyLength + 1)&lt;/code&gt; which becomes &lt;code&gt;malloc(0)&lt;/code&gt; actually returns a  valid pointer in glibc. Now you won't immediately buffer overflow here because &lt;code&gt;i &amp;lt; parser.position + parser.request.bodyLength&lt;/code&gt; where i is initialized to &lt;code&gt;parser.position&lt;/code&gt; and it's basically &lt;code&gt;parser.position-1&lt;/code&gt; so &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will always be greater. But these mangled request body and length values get routed to the webdevs App. You'd better hope they catch the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love C it's simple, elegant but also so dang annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Lights Out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lights Out is a mathematical puzzle that lives on an $n \times n$ grid where each cell of the grid is one of two colors: either red or white. The goal is to eventually get all the cells in the grid to be red. You can play the game below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original setup involves a $5 \times 5$ board, on whose cells a user may “click.” Clicking a cell will not only flip the color of that cell, but also flip the color of all the neigbors to its north, east, south, and west (call this rule &lt;code&gt;Adjacent&lt;/code&gt;). But the original variant of the game introduced to me followed a different rule &lt;code&gt;Same Row &amp;amp; Col&lt;/code&gt;: any click flips the color of all cells sharing the same row or column as the clicked cell. Another variant involves all cells sharing the same diagonal (without any wrapping), called &lt;code&gt;Diagonals&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a general strategy for solving an $n \times n$ board following the &lt;code&gt;Same Row &amp;amp; Col&lt;/code&gt; rule whenever $n$ is odd. There’s a different strategy that works under the same rule but for $n$ being even. I’m not aware of general strategies otherwise… let me know if you find one!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implemented in TypeScript with strict mode enabled. The project utilizes static type-checking, union types, and interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watch the teaser video I made for Lights Out in Manim.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;🥳 Accepted by ICLR 2025&lt;lb/&gt;📝 Released a blog with added insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discrete Distribution Networks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel generative model with simple principles and unique properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This GIF demonstrates the optimization process of DDN for 2D probability density estimation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;blur_circles&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;QR_code&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;spiral&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;gaussian&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;blur_circles&lt;/code&gt; (same at beginning and end, completing a cycle)&lt;p&gt;Contributions of this paper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Left: Illustrates the process of image reconstruction and latent acquisition in DDN. Each layer of DDN outputs &lt;lb/&gt; Right: Shows the tree-structured representation space of DDN's latent variables. Each sample can be mapped to a leaf node on this tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews from ICLR:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the method novel and elegant. The novelty is very strong, and this should not be overlooked. This is a whole new method, very different from any of the existing generative models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very good paper that can open a door to new directions in generative modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel generative model, the Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN), that approximates data distribution using hierarchical discrete distributions. We posit that since the features within a network inherently capture distributional information, enabling the network to generate multiple samples simultaneously, rather than a single output, may offer an effective way to represent distributions. Therefore, DDN fits the target distribution, including continuous ones, by generating multiple discrete sample points. To capture finer details of the target data, DDN selects the output that is closest to the Ground Truth (GT) from the coarse results generated in the first layer. This selected output is then fed back into the network as a condition for the second layer, thereby generating new outputs more similar to the GT. As the number of DDN layers increases, the representational space of the outputs expands exponentially, and the generated samples become increasingly similar to the GT. This hierarchical output pattern of discrete distributions endows DDN with unique properties: more general zero-shot conditional generation and 1D latent representation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DDN and its intriguing properties through experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DDN enables more general zero-shot conditional generation. DDN supports zero-shot conditional generation across non-pixel domains, and notably, without relying on gradient, such as text-to-image generation using a black-box CLIP model. Images enclosed in yellow borders serve as the ground truth. The abbreviations in the table header correspond to their respective tasks as follows: “SR” stands for Super-Resolution, with the following digit indicating the resolution of the condition. “ST” denotes Style Transfer, which computes Perceptual Losses with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (a) The data flow during the training phase of DDN is shown at the top. As the network depth increases, the generated images become increasingly similar to the training images. Within each Discrete Distribution Layer (DDL), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numerical values at the bottom of each figure represent the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Due to phenomena such as “dead nodes” and “density shift”, the application of Gradient Descent alone fails to properly fit the Ground Truth (GT) density. However, by employing the Split-and-Prune strategy, the KL divergence is reduced to even lower than that of the Real Samples. For a clearer and more comprehensive view of the optimization process, see the 2D Density Estimation with 10,000 Nodes DDN page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text at the top is the guide text for that column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columns 4 and 5 display the generated results under the guidance of other images, where the produced image strives to adhere to the style of the guided image as closely as possible while ensuring compliance with the condition. The resolution of the generated images is 256x256.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the features of DDN conditional generation and Zero-Shot Conditional Generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained a DDN with output level &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncompressed raw backup of this video is here: DDN_latent_video&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following content contains personal opinions and is not included in the original paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the current state of DDN, we speculate on several possible future research directions. These include improvements to DDN itself and tasks suitable for the current version of DDN. Due to my limited perspective, some of these speculations might not be accurate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving DDN through hyperparameter tuning, exploratory experiments, and theoretical analysis:&lt;lb/&gt;The total time spent developing DDN was less than three months, mostly by a single person. Therefore, experiments were preliminary, and there was limited time for detailed analysis and tuning. There is significant room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling up to ImageNet-level complexity:&lt;lb/&gt;Building a practical generative model with Zero-Shot Conditional Generation as a key feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying DDN to domains with relatively small generation spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying DDN to non-generative tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using DDN's design ideas to improve existing generative models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying DDN to language modeling tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q1: Will DDN require a lot of GPU memory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DDN's GPU memory requirements are slightly higher than conventional GAN generator using the same backbone architecture, but the difference is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, generating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;samples is only to identify the one closest to the ground truth, and the&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;unselected samples do not retain gradients, so they are immediately discarded after sampling at the current layer, freeing up memory.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the generation phase, we randomly sample an index from&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;and only generate the sample at the chosen index, avoiding the need to generate the other&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;samples, thus not occupying additional memory or computation.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2: Will there be a mode collapse issue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. DDN selects the output most similar to the current GT and then uses the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mjx-container&gt;loss to make it even more similar to the GT. This operation naturally has a diverse tendency, which can "expand" the entire generation space.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, DDN supports reconstruction. Figure 14 in the original paper shows that DDN has good reconstruction performance on the test set, meaning that DDN can fully cover the target distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real issue with DDN is not mode collapse but attempting to cover a high-dimensional target distribution that exceeds its own complexity, leading to the generation of blurry samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mesh Shaders In The Current Year&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;It Happened.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a quick post to confirm that the OpenGL/ES Working Group has signed off on the release of GL_EXT_mesh_shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Credits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a monumental release, the largest extension shipped for GL this decade, and the culmination of many, many months of work by AMD. In particular we all need to thank Qiang Yu (AMD), who spearheaded this initiative and did the vast majority of the work both in writing the specification and doing the core mesa implementation. Shihao Wang (AMD) took on the difficult task of writing actual CTS cases (not mandatory for EXT extensions in GL, so this is a huge benefit to the ecosystem).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thanks to both of you, and everyone else behind the scenes at AMD, for making this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also we have to thank the nvidium project and its author, Cortex, for single-handedly pushing the industry forward through the power of Minecraft modding. Stay sane out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minecraft mod support is already underway, so expect that to happen “soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bones of this extension have already been merged into mesa over the past couple months. I opened a MR to enable zink support this morning since I have already merged the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, I’m planning to wait until either just before the branch point next week or until RadeonSI merges its support to merge the zink MR. This is out of respect: Qiang Yu did a huge lift for everyone here, and ideally AMD’s driver should be the first to be able to advertise that extension to reflect that. But the branchpoint is coming up in a week, and SGC will be going into hibernation at the end of the month until 2026, so this offer does have an expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, we’re done here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Igalia, Servo, and the Sovereign Tech Fund&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;"Weâre proud to help shape the future of web engines through public investment in accessibility, embeddability, and sustainability."&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Igalia is excited to announce a new commission from the Sovereign Tech Fund to advance the Servo web engine. As stewards of Servo, Igalia is honored to receive support for a multi-pronged effort focused on public interest, developer usability, and long-term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo is a modern, parallelized web engine written in Rust, a Linux Foundation Europe project which Igalia has been actively maintaining since 2023, Servo represents a bold rethinking of browser architecture. Its modular design has made it a valuable resource across the Rust ecosystem. But like many promising open source technologies, Servo needs sustained investment to reach its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to investment from the Sovereign Tech Fund, Igalia will focus some important work in the next year in three key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ð§ Initial Accessibility Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Servo adoption grows, so does the need for inclusive design. Today, Servo lacks the foundational accessibility features required to support screen readers and other assistive technologies. This limits its usability in many real-world scenarios, and doesnât match our values. Despite its importance, accessibility is often one of a few things that is difficult to find funding for. Weâre grateful that thanks to this investment, weâll be able to implement initial accessibility support to ensure that Servo can serve all users. This work is essential to making Servo a viable engine for public-facing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ð§© WebView API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Embedding Servo into applications requires a stable and complete WebView API. While early work exists, itâs not yet ready for general use. Weâll be finishing the WebView API to make Servo embeddable in desktop and mobile apps, unlocking new use cases and enabling broader adoption. A robust embedding layer is critical to Servoâs eventual success as a general-purpose engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ð§ Project Maintenance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Servo is more than a browser engineâitâs a collection of crates used widely across the Rust ecosystem. Maintaining these libraries benefits not just Servo, but the broader web platform. The project and the community have been growing a lot since weâve taken over stewardship. This funding will allow our work will include more issue triage, pull request review, version releases, and governance support. All of this helps ensure that Servo remains active, responsive, and well-maintained for developers and users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Igalia has long championed open source innovation in the browser space, from our work on Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko to our leadership in standards bodies and developer tooling. We believe Servo has a unique role to play in the future of web engines, and weâre thrilled to help guide its next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the Sovereign Tech Fund for recognizing the importance of this work. We look forward to sharing progress as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;All-Natural Geoengineering with Frank Herbert's Dune&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can We Terraform the Earth Using Life Itself?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Science fiction understood something fundamental before science caught up. Frank Herbert’s Dune imagined the Fremen attempting to terraform Arrakis. They succeeded technically but discovered too late (though Paul Atreides and the God Emperor Leto knew exactly what they were doing) they’d destroyed the desert ecology their entire civilization depended on. The sandworms died. The spice disappeared. Their power evaporated. Half a century after Herbert, The Expanse imagined the Protomolecule, alien biotechnology designed to hijack existing “self replicating systems” and reorganize it into building the Ring Gates. Both stories grasped the same insight: life is technology. Self-replicating, self-maintaining, infinitely adaptable. Deploy living systems at planetary scale and you’ll discover reciprocal dependencies you can’t escape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1965, James Lovelock proposed this same idea as scientific hypothesis while working for NASA’s Viking missions. Earth’s atmosphere appeared too far from chemical equilibrium to be explained by geology alone. Life wasn’t simply adapting to planetary conditions. It was actively regulating them as much as it was responding to them. The Gaia hypothesis suggested that living organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings to maintain conditions suitable for life, effectively operating as a self-regulating system at planetary scale (though shocks like giant meteors and system disruptions can still collapse it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see this with other creatures besides ourselves. Beavers are recognized as quintessential ecosystem engineers, with remarkable abilities to modify ecosystems profoundly through dam construction, altering river corridor hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and ecosystems. The southern Amazon rainforest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves, providing observational evidence that forests actively create their own weather systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the practical sense? Citizens already pay environmental costs whether governments acknowledge it or not: flooded basements, insurance spikes, hurricane damage, wildfire smoke. Municipal budgets hemorrhage money on disaster recovery that grows more expensive each year. People worry about the future.&lt;lb/&gt;The governance choice is simpler than climate debates suggest: exam to see if deploying biological infrastructure providing one or multiple services at once (mangrove forests that reduce storm surge, support fisheries, and maintain themselves for decades etc etc ). &lt;lb/&gt;The bottleneck isn’t only knowledge about what works and what not. They lack procurement frameworks, trained contractors, and political authorization to fund infrastructure maturing over five years instead of delivering ribbon-cutting photo opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Hydrology: Water That Engineers Itself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Beavers: 60 Million Years of Autonomous Watershed R&amp;amp;D&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beavers (Castor fiber and Castor canadensis) are among the most influential mammalian ecosystem engineers, heavily modifying river corridor hydrology and geomorphology primarily through dam construction, which impounds flow and increases open water extent. Simulations show beaver dam construction can result in a 90% increase in groundwater discharge from wetland ponds in systems connected to regional groundwater flow. The dams create stepped water tables that slow floods during storms and extend groundwater availability during droughts: natural water storage infrastructure that adjusts dynamically to conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineering is sophisticated. Dams trap sediment, creating rich substrate for vegetation while filtering water. Oyster reefs and beaver structures share similar mechanics: both attenuate wave energy and reduce estuarine currents while stabilizing seabed sediments. Their modifications increase water storage and create wildfire refugia. A 2018 technical report documented native riparian vegetation persisting unburnt during Idaho’s Sharps Fire where active beaver dams were present. Beaver wetland ecosystems have persisted throughout the Northern Hemisphere during numerous prior periods of climatic change, demonstrating remarkable adaptive capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where beavers can’t return immediately, humans build like beavers. BDAs are low-tech, cost-effective stream restoration tools built with natural materials like willow and aspen, using vertical posts woven with brushy vegetation and packed with mud to mimic beaver dams. Two years after the National Forest Foundation built beaver dam analogues along Colorado’s Trail Creek, beavers moved back and began building dams of their own. The structures don’t replace beavers. They create conditions for beavers to return and take over maintenance, converting capital expenditure into self-maintaining biological infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA uses satellite Earth observations through a program with Boise State University to track how reintroduced beavers change Idaho’s landscape, producing images from space showing areas with reintroduced beavers are greener than areas without them. Recent research using explanatory modeling of 87 beaver pond complexes found that dam length, woody vegetation height, and stream power index explained 74% of the variation in pond area, providing empirical foundations for site selection in beaver restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations Leading BDA Implementation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beaver Institute: Runs BeaverCorps, the only professional non-lethal beaver management training program&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ecotone, Inc.: Ecological restoration company implementing BDAs across Maryland&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anabranch Solutions: River restoration company that documented beaver fire mitigation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beaver Deceivers International: Company focused on infrastructure protection while allowing beaver habitat improvement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bioswales: Engineered Filtration Systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bioswales are the most effective type of green infrastructure in slowing runoff velocity and cleansing water while recharging groundwater. These linear wetlands function through multiple pathways. A Davis, California study eight years after construction found treatment bioswales reduced surface runoff by 99.4%, nitrogen, phosphate, and total organic carbon loading by 99.1%, 99.5%, and 99.4% respectively. The engineered soil mix (75% native lava rock and 25% loam) replaced native soil to maximize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The physical design matters. Bioswales feature gently sloped sides (ideally 4:1, maximum 3:1) with slight longitudinal slopes that move water along the surface, allowing sediments and pollutants to settle while localized groundwater recharge occurs through infiltration. Studies documented temperature reductions of 2-4°C in and around bioswale elements, contributing to urban heat island mitigation. In water-scarce regions with declining aquifer levels, bioswales help replenish groundwater resources, offsetting impacts of impervious surfaces on the hydrologic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 500 residential areas with bioswales are spread across the Netherlands, especially in newer districts. Research shows bioswales continue functioning well even in extreme weather conditions and in low-lying areas with high groundwater levels and low soil permeability. Gdańskie Wody adopted a pioneering strategy starting construction of the first rain garden in 2018, with organizational policy now stipulating construction of nature-based solutions in new housing estates without building rainwater drainage, creating systematic deployment through regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rain Gardens: Strategic Stormwater Interception&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rain gardens are shallow, landscaped depressions designed to capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff as it moves downstream, sized to treat the “first flush” (the first and most polluted volume from storm events). Compared to conventional lawn, one rain garden allows approximately 30% more water to infiltrate into the ground and contribute to regional underground aquifer recharge. A 2021 study using gradient boosting machine learning found that vegetation type, plant density, and flow conditions significantly affect infiltration rates, with models achieving 97.6% correlation accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two types serve different contexts. Infiltration rain gardens allow runoff to pass through mulch and soil layers, slowly dispersing water into native soils and controlling runoff volumes. Filtration rain gardens use similar processes but pipe water elsewhere, used where infiltration to underlying soils is unsafe due to contamination concerns. Recent modeling based on Darcy’s law found that filtration coefficients and layer thickness are the main parameters affecting saturation depth and water column height. When the top layer’s filtration coefficient is 7.0 cm/h, complete saturation doesn’t occur within 2 hours, allowing continuous storm event management without overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The largest sustainable drainage system in Norway was built at Bryggen, Bergen to raise and stabilize groundwater levels, protecting UNESCO World Heritage cultural layers. Full-scale infiltration testing showed capacity of 510-1600 mm/h, with immediate groundwater response in wells within 30m and 2-day delayed response 75-100m away. Rain gardens can recharge aquifers at distance from the installation site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Johads: Community-Owned Water Harvesting&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Johads are crescent-shaped earthen dams built across contours to slow monsoon runoff. The structures are simple mud-and-rubble barrier check dams with high embankments on three sides, collecting and storing water for groundwater recharge, washing, bathing, and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS), led by Rajendra Singh, has constructed 13,800 functioning rainwater harvesting systems and rejuvenated 13 rivers across India. By 2005, TBS counted 5,000 structures in 750 villages, covering 3,000 square miles over five districts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The river Arvari became perennial in 1995 after successive johads built along its watershed. Four more rivers (Sarsa, Ruparel, Bhagani, and Jahajwali) have become perennial following johad construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A survey of 970 wells in 120 villages found all were flowing, including 800 that had been dry just six years before. Alwar’s forest spread 33 percent in fifteen years, and groundwater levels rose by nearly 6 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBS enabled communities to form the River Arvari Parliament, comprising members from gram sabhas of 72 villages along the river (one of India’s first community-led river governance structures).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Xeriscaping: Water-Wise Native Landscaping&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xeriscaping can reduce water consumption by 60% or more compared to regular lawn landscapes. A Turkish study found that switching an average city park to more native vegetation lowered irrigation usage by 30-50%, saving roughly $2 million annually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Native plants have deep root systems that help manage rainwater runoff and maintain healthy soil, mitigating floods and preventing soil compaction. They resist damage from freezing, drought, common diseases, and herbivores without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Native plants attract other native species, including pollinators, keeping gardens healthy year after year. They require no soil amendments or fertilizer once established.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Coastal &amp;amp; Ecosystem Engineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster Reefs: Living Breakwaters That Filter and Protect&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster reefs provide ecosystem services including habitat provisioning, water filtration, and shoreline protection, representing one of the most dramatic declines of a foundation species worldwide. Under certain conditions, a single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day. A healthy reef processes enormous volumes, removing algae, nitrogen, and pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wave attenuation occurs through breaking, reflection, overtopping, and frictional dissipation, with wave breaking considered most essential for energy attenuation of submerged structures. Wave transmission decreases with increasing freeboard (difference between reef crest elevation and water level), with oyster reefs producing greatest wave attenuation when the crest is at or above still water level. When oyster reef exposure time exceeds 50%, wave height can be reduced by 68%, though this creates less favorable oyster growth conditions. Optimal design requires balancing wave attenuation with oyster inundation requirements (60-80% for optimal growth). Research now focuses on optimizing other reef parameters like width for wave attenuation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster reefs create complex three-dimensional habitat. A 4-inch square patch hosts more than 1,000 individual invertebrates from different biological groups, providing nursery habitat for commercially valuable fish species and supporting food webs that extend well beyond the reef itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple companies are developing technologies to accelerate reef restoration at scale:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Oyster Restoration Company (Scotland) launched Rapid Reef in 2025, an innovative product using recycled shells as substrate for native oyster spat. Each Rapid Reef bag contains approximately 15,000 oysters covering at least 5m² of seabed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coastal Technologies Corp developed a nature-inspired oyster reef system that raises oysters off the seafloor using vertical poles with plates, making reefs climate-change-proof since additional height can be added to account for rising sea levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oyster Heaven (Netherlands/UK) uses specially designed clay bricks called “Mother Reefs” pre-charged with at least 100 oysters each. Partnered with Purina to deploy 40,000 Mother Reefs (4 million oysters) off Norfolk coast by end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van Oord pilots oyster reef restoration integrated with offshore wind infrastructure using “remote setting” method, cultivating oyster larvae in hatcheries before transferring them into seawater-filled containers with rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Billion Oyster Project (New York) is restoring oyster reefs to New York Harbor with over 100 schools and nearly 15,000 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mangroves: Storm Surge Dampeners and Carbon Vaults&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mangroves provide an estimated $65 billion per year globally in storm protection services according to 2020 research, with a 2024 study updating this to $855 billion in flood protection services worldwide, accounting for increasing populations, wealth, and storms on coastlines. The dense root systems of mangrove trees can reduce large storm surges by over 50% as they flow through mangrove forests, with roots causing friction that dissipates energy and motion of water. The economic value of mangroves for services that rely on conserving them, such as flood protection, is typically not included within national budgets and wealth accounts, unlike services such as timber production. This creates a systematic undervaluation of preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mangroves store five times more carbon in their soils by surface area than tropical forests and ten times more than temperate forests. They also provide shelter for marine life and absorb microplastics. Mangroves trap sediment, build land through accretion, stabilize coastlines, create critical habitat for commercially valuable fisheries, and filter water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional hand-planting of mangroves is cumbersome in muddy terrain. Multiple organizations now deploy drone technology:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distant Imagery (UAE) was contracted by ADNOC to plant 2.5 million mangrove seedlings across Abu Dhabi using drones that can disperse over 2,000 mangrove seeds in roughly eight minutes. Has planted approximately 1.5 million mangrove trees and claims to be the first in the world to successfully restore mangroves with drones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dendra Systems (UAE) is completing a $27.3 million project to restore 27 million mangroves across 10,000 hectares in the UAE over 5 years. Their custom seeding drones can seed over 100,000 mangroves in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ReleaseLabs + Panama Flying Labs developed autonomous release systems carrying 750+ seed balls per load, distributing them accurately in less than five minutes over one hectare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UAVs coupled with AI and machine learning enable detailed mapping, 3D modelling, invasive species detection, and measurement of vital parameters like vegetation health, carbon storage, and mangrove changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Seaweed Farming: The Ocean’s Fast-Growing Carbon Sink&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seaweed grows remarkably fast, up to two feet per day, allowing rapid carbon dioxide absorption during photosynthesis. A 2025 study in Nature Climate Change found seaweed farming in depositional environments buries carbon in underlying sediments at rates averaging 1.87 ± 0.73 tCO2e ha-1 yr-1, twice that in reference sediments. For the oldest farm studied (300 years in operation), organic carbon stocks reached 140 tC ha-1. Seaweeds absorb dissolved inorganic carbon, converting it into biomass, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), or particulate organic carbon (POC), with offshore aquaculture achieving 94% sequestration rates at depths over 2,000 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seaweed absorbs CO2 more effectively than trees and improves water quality by extracting harmful nutrients. Adding certain seaweed types to cattle feed can reduce methane output by up to 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Climate Foundation is developing fully automated, solar-powered, floating kelp farms using deep cycling (lowering kelp 125 meters each night to nutrient-rich waters), making kelp grow three times faster than shallow-water farming. Sea6 Energy (India/Indonesia) is mechanizing tropical seaweed farming with ‘SeaCombine’, a tractor-like vehicle that sows seeds and harvests sea plants offshore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Dryland Regeneration and Integrated Systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nitrogen-Fixing Trees: Atmospheric Fertilizer Factories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nitrogen-fixing trees host Rhizobium bacteria on their roots that convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms absorbable by plant roots, a process called biological nitrogen fixation. These trees don’t just fix nitrogen for themselves. Some species like mesquite (Prosopis) fix nitrogen directly into soil rather than into root nodules, meaning other plants can use this nitrogen immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most suitable trees for dryland soil improvement are slow-growing nitrogen fixers with easily decomposing leaves low in allelochemicals, such as Acacia, Carob, or Albizia. Fast-growing trees like Eucalyptus do little for soil improvement and deplete topsoil humidity, out-competing other vegetation. Dryland trees recover nutrients from deep soil layers, subsequently contributing them as leaf litter to enrich topsoil, essential for returning minerals that have leached beyond reach of shallow-rooted plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acacia saligna is a nitrogen-fixing tree native to southwest Western Australia, planted in North Africa and the Middle East for fodder, fuelwood, sand stabilization, and windbreaks. It tolerates mean annual rainfall of 300-1,000mm and temperatures from 4°C to 36°C, though sensitive to frosts below -4°C. A site at Project Wadi Attir overlaid with organic matter displayed ten-fold productivity compared to nearby untreated degraded soil for at least eight years. Acacia woodland with closed leaf litter similarly showed ten-fold productivity compared to nearby degraded shrubland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Integrated Farming Systems: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Refinements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated rice-animal farming systems originated in Southeast Asia over 6,000 years ago. The Chinese rice-fish-duck symbiosis system has nearly a thousand years of history as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System. These systems manage water, nutrient cycling, and pest control through ecological design rather than chemical inputs (field-scale biological geoengineering).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In China’s Congjiang county, 12,600 hectares of rice-fish-duck fields cycle resources: rice shoots provide shade and organic food for fish and ducks, who feed on pests and produce manure, weeding, fertilizing and oxygenating fields without pesticides. Ecosystem services valuation for the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces totaled 3.316 billion CNY: 1.76 billion in provisioning services, 1.32 billion in regulation and maintenance, 230.85 million in cultural services. Ducks eat weeds preventing competition with rice, duck manure fertilizes fields, and dabbling in soil improves water parameters including nitrate, dissolved organic matter, and dissolved oxygen. Production rises compared to rice monoculture. Fish and the nitrogen-fixing aquatic fern azolla integrate for nutrient enhancement and feed supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern Refinements: The Furuno System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japanese farmer Takao Furuno refined traditional aigamo (duck-rice) methods in the 1980s, developing an integrated system that matches or surpasses conventional chemical-intensive yields while eliminating synthetic inputs. Through systematic experimentation, Furuno identified optimal parameters: ducklings released at 7 days old, 15-30 ducklings per tenth hectare, removal at 8 weeks to prevent rice grain consumption. Adding loaches (freshwater fish) and azolla to fields boosted rice and duck growth while supplying duck nutrition. Wire strung across fields deterred birds of prey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furuno’s 3.2-hectare farm generates US$160,000 annually from rice, organic vegetables, eggs, and ducklings(approximately $50,000 per hectare). Modern enclosure systems and artificial hatching on precise schedules reduced labor costs compared to traditional methods. Manual weeding requires 240 person-hours per hectare annually; integrated duck-rice systems eliminate this entirely while farmers gain time for family or other activities. Through writing, lectures, and cooperation with agricultural organizations and governments, Furuno’s methods spread to more than 75,000 farmers in Japan, Korea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Iran, and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even thousand-year-old systems face extinction. The Chinese rice-fish-duck system confronts threats: rural labor transfer, low marketization and industrialization, weakening cultural awareness, and climate change. Invasive golden apple snails now eat azolla, reducing its effectiveness. Ecological disruptions compound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indigenous North American agriculture developed complementary polyculture independently. The Three Sisters system (corn, beans, squash) uses niche complementarity: cornstalks serve as trellises for climbing beans, beans fix nitrogen in soil through Rhizobium bacteria, and wide squash leaves shade ground, keeping soil moist and preventing weed establishment. A modern experiment found Haudenosaunee Three Sisters polyculture provided both more energy and more protein than any local monoculture. Meta-analyses show intercropping provides 22-32% yield advantage compared to monocrops when normalized for land area. Intercropping with diverse plant resource acquisition strategies promotes efficient resource use, with positive belowground effects on soil biota.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intercropping creates complex canopy structures making mechanized harvesting very difficult. Close-knit intercropping often requires precise weed control and hand-harvesting, currently limiting it to smaller scales. Improvements in image-recognition software and robotics for automated management and harvesting may eventually enable large-scale intercropping. Three Sisters principles inform design of mechanizable integrated approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Automation Gradient&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hand labor required: Three Sisters simultaneous polyculture (complex canopy, irregular plant heights, intertwined root systems).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partially mechanizable: Rice-duck systems (mechanized rice planting/harvesting with standard equipment, manual duck management, temporal overlap during growing season).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fully mechanized: Rice-crawfish rotation (complete temporal separation, standard rice harvesting equipment, automated flooding cycles).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future potential: Advanced robotics enabling complex polyculture at scale (under development).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rice-Crawfish: Industrial-Scale Integration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Louisiana’s rice-crawfish rotation is the state’s most valuable aquaculture commodity: approximately 184,000 acres producing crawfish valued at approximately $170 million. Louisiana accounts for 96.4% of U.S. crawfish sales. The system scales industrially by solving constraints that limit other integrated approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Temporal separation: Rice is planted, grown, and harvested using standard equipment. Fields are then reflooded for crawfish, with no simultaneous crops requiring selective harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure compatibility: Fields suitable for rice production work for crawfish (flat soils, levees for water control, irrigation systems already in place). Many farmers in southern Louisiana already had flood irrigation systems favoring rice-crawfish over rice-soybean rotations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal equipment modification: Specialized crawfish harvesting boats and traps are additions, not replacements, for existing rice infrastructure. Rice harvesting proceeds exactly as in monoculture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revenue diversification without complexity: Crawfish provide income during off-peak periods using permanent farm labor and equipment. Crawfish “caught in Jeff Davis Parish in the morning can be consumed in Houston tonight”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-sustaining biology: Crawfish feed on rice stubble creating a detritus-based food chain, requiring no supplemental feeding. Natural reproduction eliminates need for hatcheries. Vegetation that grew during summer breaks down to support natural food web yielding 350-900 lb harvestable crawfish per acre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ecosystem benefits: Less disease pressure after crawfish compared to soybean rotation. Crawfish ponds serve as wetland habitat for waterfowl, wading birds, and furbearers. Water leaving ponds often equals or exceeds input quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rice-crawfish scales through temporal separation, infrastructure compatibility, simple logistics. Rice-fish and rice-duck systems have relatively higher ecological adaptability than other integrated systems, making them suitable for large-scale application across varied climates. Only rice-crawfish achieved widespread industrial adoption in Western contexts by solving the automation challenge through rotation rather than simultaneity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Atmospheric Systems: Trees as Rain Makers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biogenic Aerosols: How Trees Seed Clouds&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trees don’t just respond to weather. They create it through chemical signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important natural gases involved in cloud formation are isoprenes, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes: hydrocarbons mainly released by vegetation that are key components of essential oils we smell when grass is cut or during forest walks. When these substances oxidize (react with ozone) in air, they form aerosols. The oxidation of a natural mixture of isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in pure air produces Ultra-Low-Volatility Organic Compounds (ULVOCs) that form particles very efficiently, which can grow over time to become cloud condensation nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At equivalent concentrations, sesquiterpenes form particles at a rate ten times higher than monoterpenes or isoprenes. A single sesquiterpene molecule comprises 15 carbon atoms, while monoterpenes have ten and isoprenes merely five. The larger molecular structure enables more efficient particle formation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CERN’s CLOUD chamber (the purest sealed environment globally) simulates varied atmospheric conditions at extremely low sesquiterpene concentrations found in nature, allowing researchers to study biogenic particle formation under pre-industrial conditions (without anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions). CLOUD findings show that isoprene from forests represents a major source of biogenic particles currently missing in climate models, with isoprene now recognized as capable of forming new particles in the atmosphere, contrary to prior assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With tighter environmental regulations, sulfur dioxide concentration has declined significantly. Terpene concentration increases because plants release more when experiencing stress: higher temperatures, extreme weather, and droughts. Sesquiterpenes should be included as a separate factor in future climate models alongside isoprenes and monoterpenes, especially given the decrease in atmospheric sulfur dioxide concentrations and simultaneous increase in biogenic emissions due to climate stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Amazon: A Rain Machine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Amazon rainforest triggers its own rainy season 2-3 months before seasonal winds bring ocean moisture. NASA’s Aura satellite measurements show moisture high in deuterium (a heavy isotope signature proving transpiration rather than ocean evaporation). The deuterium content was highest at the end of the dry season during peak photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a typical day, trees release 20 billion tons of moisture into the atmosphere, with moisture recycled from sky to land five to six times as clouds move westward. As tree-induced rain clouds release rain, they warm the atmosphere, causing air to rise and triggering circulation large enough to shift wind patterns that bring in more ocean moisture. The forest essentially summons its own rainy season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “biotic pump theory” proposes the Amazon as the beating “heart of the Earth” (millions of trees working together releasing water vapor that circulates weather patterns globally). Flying rivers carry rainwater in atmospheric streams influencing rainfall as far as Argentina and potentially the Western United States. Evapotranspiration from the Amazon basin provides atmospheric moisture that influences weather patterns and rainfall as far away as the US, meaning forest loss may contribute to droughts and wildfire risks far beyond South America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over a large fraction of the southern Amazon, the dry season is now only a few weeks shorter on average than the transitional threshold between wet forest and savanna. There has already been some irreversible damage, with delayed wet season onset evidence that deforestation is playing a role in reducing the forest’s cloud-building capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Unintended Geoengineering Experiment: Ship Tracks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, UN International Maritime Organization regulations cut ships’ sulfur pollution by more than 80%, lessening the effect of sulfate particles in seeding and brightening ship track clouds (distinctive low-lying, reflective clouds that help cool the planet). Ship tracks were first observed as “anomalous cloud lines” in 1960s weather satellite images, formed by water vapor coalescing around small particles of pollution in ship exhaust, with highly concentrated droplets scattering more light and appearing brighter than non-polluted marine clouds seeded by larger particles like sea salt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 2024 PNNL study found that nearly 20 percent of 2023’s record warmth likely came from reduced sulfur emissions from shipping, with machine learning scanning over a million satellite images revealing a 25 to 50 percent reduction in visible tracks. The 2020 regulation led to a radiative forcing of +0.2±0.11 W/m² averaged over the global ocean, potentially doubling the warming rate in the 2020s compared with rates since 1980, with strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In shipping corridors where maritime traffic is particularly dense, the increased light represents a 50% boost to the warming effect of human carbon emissions (equivalent to losing the cooling effect from a fairly large volcanic eruption each year).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marine Cloud Brightening Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The irony: We accidentally discovered we’d been cooling the planet with pollution, stopped it for health reasons (correctly), and now multiple organizations are studying how to replicate the cooling effect using benign materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Marine Cloud Brightening Research Program at University of Washington, funded by SilverLining’s Safe Climate Research Initiative, is an open collaboration of atmospheric scientists studying how clouds respond to aerosols to investigate the feasibility and potential impacts of reducing climate warming by intentionally increasing reflection of sunlight from marine clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leading proposed method is generating a fine mist of sea salt from seawater (~200 nm particles) and delivering it into targeted marine stratocumulus clouds from ships traversing the ocean. Small-scale field tests were conducted on the Great Barrier Reef in 2024. Lowercarbon Capital, with over $800 million in assets, is supporting the nonprofit Marine Cloud Brightening Project alongside academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Marine Cloud Brightening Project team at University of Washington, PARC, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory developed effervescent nozzles that spray tiny droplets of saltwater. They see several key advantages: marine clouds over dark ocean surfaces yield highest albedo change, and clouds are conveniently close to the liquid they want to spray.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marine cloud brightening is based on phenomena currently observed in the climate system. Today, emissions particles like soot mix with clouds and increase sunlight reflection, producing a cooling effect estimated between 0.5 and 1.5°C (one of the most important unknowns in climate science). The National Academies of Sciences recommends the US invest $100-200 million in solar geoengineering research over 5 years to determine whether the technology should be on the table as potential climate change mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Failure Modes, Tradeoffs, and Scaling Challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples above demonstrate elegant natural systems. Scaling them requires confronting four categories of problems: ecological mismatches, governance failures, industrial constraints, and political fragility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ecological Mismatch: The Icelandic Lupin Lesson&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nootka lupine (Lupinus nootkatensis), native to Alaska and British Columbia, was introduced to Iceland in 1945 to combat erosion. As a nitrogen fixer hosting bacteria that gather atmospheric nitrogen, the plant successfully reversed catastrophic topsoil loss from centuries of overgrazing. Dense lupine cover and soil fertility can be gained within relatively short time spans where growth isn’t limited by droughts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem: Lupines now cover 0.4% of Iceland’s land surface. Under current climate change rates, lupine could colonize much of the highland interior within 30 years, potentially erasing naturally occurring landscapes. The species has been designated invasive, with tendency to create monocultures preventing other plant growth. The lupine case reveals a fundamental tension: biological solutions that work brilliantly at small scales can become problems at landscape scales if succession dynamics are misunderstood or if climate changes faster than ecosystems can adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Governance and Property Rights: Who Controls the Systems?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The River Arvari Parliament demonstrates one governance model. TBS enabled communities to form the River Arvari Parliament, comprising members from gram sabhas of 72 villages (one of India’s first community-led river governance structures). This works in Rajasthan because water scarcity creates immediate benefits to cooperation, village-level governance structures already existed, and Rajendra Singh spent years building trust before scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Netherlands offers a contrasting model with more than 500 residential areas with bioswales. Dutch success stems from national-level planning authority, clear liability frameworks, centuries of collective water management experience, and high population density making defection costly. Neither model transfers easily. Rajasthan’s approach requires social capital most places lack; Dutch centralized planning requires state capacity uncommon outside Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Industrial Bottlenecks and Political Fragility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The foundational constraint is energy capacity. No terraforming or geoengineering approach (biological or technological) can scale without abundant, decarbonized energy at sufficient overcapacity to power both deployment and ongoing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reality precedes any discussion of biological versus engineered systems. Scaling biological geoengineering requires industrial capacity that most discussions ignore. Drone-seeding 27 million mangroves demands manufacturing infrastructure. Deploying 40,000 Mother Reefs needs fabrication facilities. All require massive energy inputs. The limiting factor isn’t biological knowledge or technical standardization. It’s industrial throughput, energy availability, and the political will to sustain both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Three Industrial Constraints&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;California pays ~$0.24/kWh for industrial electricity; China’s Pearl River Delta pays ~$0.09/kWh. Manufacturing oyster reef components, seeding drones, or kelp farm infrastructure at 2.7x energy costs makes projects economically unviable. Texas achieves ~$0.06/kWh, but American electricity prices rise sharply near concentrations of human capital—precisely where technical expertise concentrates. High voltage direct current transmission could move gigawatts across continents; failure to deploy transmission infrastructure is purely policy failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China deployed more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined. Between 2017 and 2023, China increased robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers from 97 to ~470—a 5x increase. Over the same period, America’s robot density grew &amp;lt;0.5x for a shrinking workforce. Chinese manufacturers can tool up production lines with 6-axis robot arms at $8,250 per unit (Borunte, 10kg payload, 0.05mm repeatability). No comparable Western alternative exists at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial capital flows to high-return financial engineering while physical capital accumulation stagnates. Biological geoengineering provides diffuse public benefits (flood protection, carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge) over decades, not concentrated private returns over quarters. Private capital won’t fund these systems at necessary scale. Public capital flows through procurement processes designed for conventional infrastructure, not living systems that mature over 5-20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Productive Overcapacity: The Marshall Plan Framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martin Sandbu’s analysis of China’s surplus provides the solution framework. Post-WWII America ran external surpluses exceeding 2% of GDP, yet industrial production grew strongly in both surplus America and deficit Europe simultaneously. US surplus earnings funded productive investments in European infrastructure through Marshall Plan structures that directed capital toward growth-enhancing uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world faces massive infrastructure deficits while China manufactures restoration infrastructure components (solar panels, battery systems, precision sensors) at 30-50% of Western costs. This surplus production could be productively absorbed by biological geoengineering deployment—if financing mechanisms existed to direct it there. What’s needed: Infrastructure financing institutions specifically capitalized for biological geoengineering procurement, technology transfer frameworks allowing joint ventures, long-term purchase agreements giving manufacturers certainty to invest in automated production lines, and performance-based financing that pays for outcomes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political Fragility: The Fate of Successful Programs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if industrial capacity could be built, sustaining it requires political will that historically evaporates once systems succeed. Successful infrastructure becomes invisible, and invisible infrastructure becomes vulnerable. When systems work, citizens don’t see the research apparatus, maintenance programs, or policy coordination that made success possible. Politicians see “expensive programs” consuming budget without visible output. Budget cuts deliver immediate fiscal savings. The costs (system degradation, lost competitiveness, technological stagnation) materialize slowly over years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern repeats across successful public goods. American interstate highways, built in the 1950s-60s, enabled trillions in economic activity yet crumble from deferred maintenance because functional infrastructure generates no political urgency. NASA’s Apollo program put humans on the moon; its current budget is one-third of 1960s levels as percentage of federal spending. The Internet emerged from DARPA and NSF funding; once successful, both faced budget cuts as politicians questioned why government should fund “established” technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biological geoengineering faces this same trap. If oyster reefs successfully protect coastlines, will politicians maintain funding for reef restoration research and deployment 20 years later? Or will successful coastal protection be taken for granted, making restoration programs easy targets during the next fiscal crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relying solely on institutional models creates political vulnerability. Successful programs become targets for cuts precisely because they work well enough to be taken for granted. This argues for embedding biological geoengineering in physical capital and industrial capacity rather than purely institutional structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Wageningen Model: Success in Agricultural Applications (and Its Limits)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research (WUR) demonstrates how to scale biological interventions, but only for agricultural and agritech applications, representing perhaps 15-20% of biological geoengineering’s total scope. Widely regarded as the world’s top agricultural research institution, WUR is the nodal point of Food Valley, an expansive cluster of agricultural technology start-ups and experimental farms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Netherlands is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter, with agricultural exports reaching €128.9 billion in 2024 (remarkable for a country holding only 0.04% of global agricultural land). This success stems from research and development resources that tripled over three decades. A radical 1998 restructuring merged diverse research instituteswith agricultural research institutes of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, enabling systematic translation of research into policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WUR’s approach integrates four elements: applied research at commercial scale (1,200 hectares of research farms identifying economic bottlenecks); public-private partnerships structuring funding; extension services training agricultural consultants; and policy integration informing Dutch and EU agricultural policy. This model works brilliantly for agricultural interventions (disease-resistant crop varieties, fertilizer optimization, efficient irrigation). It does not solve manufacturing oyster reefs at scale, producing seeding drones, or building automated kelp farm infrastructure. Seed breeding requires laboratory facilities and experimental plots. Manufacturing Mother Reefs requires kilns, automated production lines, biosecure hatcheries, and coastal logistics networks (fundamentally different challenges requiring different institutional structures).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet even Wageningen faces vulnerability. WUR announced in July 2024 it must cut spending by €80 million. A 2019 Rabobank analysis found that every €1 of research and development capital resulted in €4.20 of added value for society. The institution that enabled the Netherlands to become the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter faces budget cuts because successful infrastructure becomes invisible. Politicians see “expensive universities” consuming budget without visible output. The €4.20 return per €1 invested is diffuse (spread across thousands of farms, millions of consumers, decades of incremental improvement). This reveals a perverse dynamic: successful programs become targets for cuts precisely because they work well enough to be taken for granted. This argues for embedding biological geoengineering in physical capital and industrial capacity rather than purely institutional structures. A functioning oyster reef production line (with invested capital, trained workers, established supply chains, and purchase contracts) is harder to dismantle through budget cuts than a university research program. Manufacturing capacity has political economy advantages over knowledge institutions: it’s visible, employs workers who vote, generates revenue, and involves private capital that resists expropriation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Applying the Wageningen Model to Biological Geoengineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies like Oyster Heaven and Coastal Technologies Corp have proven technical feasibility of oyster reef restoration. Economic barriers remain: oyster reefs need 5-10 years to provide comparable wave attenuation to traditional breakwaters; existing engineering liability insurance doesn’t cover biological systems; traditional infrastructure budgets don’t include line items for ecological monitoring. Wageningen’s approach suggests solutions: establish demonstration reefs at scale (10+ hectares) generating performance data for insurers and engineers; create public-private partnerships sharing risk and revenue from avoided coastal damages; train coastal managers in ecological engineering; integrate living shorelines into infrastructure codes. The Netherlands now requires nature-based solutions be evaluated alongside traditional engineering for any coastal project over €5 million, creating guaranteed market demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Speed Problem and Integration Challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate impacts accelerate while biological systems require time to mature, from fast interventions like bioswales and seaweed farming (1-5 years) through medium-term oyster reef and mangrove restoration (5-20 years) to slow forest establishment for climate regulation (20+ years). Three responses address this mismatch: combine biological and engineered systems (Dutch flood management combines dikes for immediate protection with wetland restoration for long-term flexibility); accept partial solutions (young mangrove forests provide 30% of mature forest storm protection but sequester carbon at 3x the rate); deploy biological systems where speed advantages exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real frontier isn’t choosing between engineered and biological systems but integrating them effectively. Van Oord’s oyster reef integration with offshore wind infrastructure demonstrates this: cultivating oyster larvae in hatcheries, then integrating oyster-bearing rocks into wind farms, subsea cabling, and breakwaters. This provides enhanced wave protection for wind farm foundations, biodiversity offsets required for construction permits, additional revenue from potential harvest, and simplified permitting. Integration requires professionals who understand both engineered and biological systems (a skill set current education systems don’t systematically produce).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We’re Not There Yet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical feasibility is proven. Beavers engineer watersheds, the Amazon manufactures weather, mangroves provide $855 billion in flood protection (planetary-scale infrastructure operating through Lovelock’s self-regulating mechanisms). But Section 5’s constraints reveal we’re nowhere close to climate-relevant deployment. Ecological mismatch and governance have solutions. Wageningen works brilliantly for agricultural applications but solves perhaps 15-20% of biological geoengineering (offering no template for manufacturing oyster reefs or seeding drones at scale).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Industrial capacity is the ultimate bottleneck: cheap electricity (China’s $0.09/kWh vs California’s $0.24/kWh), automated production (China deployed more industrial robots in 2023 than the rest of the world combined), and capital allocation for diffuse public benefits over decades. Even Wageningen (returning €4.20 per €1 invested) faces €80 million in cuts because successful infrastructure becomes invisible. Three choices: build domestic capacity (expensive, slow, autonomous); leverage Chinese manufacturing (cheaper, faster, dependent); or accept biological geoengineering won’t scale, forcing us toward riskier interventions. Current trajectories suggest the third by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fremen succeeded technically (planted trees, established water cycles, created paradise) then discovered they’d destroyed the desert ecology sustaining them ( I mean, it’s all part of the Golden Path and the God Emperor did break himself down into the sand trout that become’s Dune’s iconic worms but that’s besides the point!). We’re making the opposite mistake. We understand biological systems remarkably well but haven’t built industrial capacity to deploy them at necessary speed and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An investigation is under way after a Ryanair flight battling with high wind speeds during storm Amy last week landed at Manchester airport with just six minutes of fuel left in its tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pilots had been taking passengers from Pisa in Italy to Prestwick in Scotland on Friday evening, but wind speeds of up to 100mph meant they were unable to land.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After three failed attempts to touch down, the pilots of Ryanair flight FR3418 issued a mayday emergency call and raced to Manchester, where the weather was calmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Boeing 737-800 had just 220kg of fuel left in its tanks when it finally landed, according to a picture of what appears to be a handwritten technical log. Pilots who examined the picture said this would be enough for just five or six minutes of flying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysis of the log suggests the plane left Pisa with reserve fuel, as commercial flights are required to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the airline said: “Ryanair reported this to the relevant authorities on Friday [3 October]. As this is now subject of an ongoing investigation, which we are co-operating fully with, we are unable to comment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Air Accidents Investigation Branch confirmed on Thursday it had opened an investigation after being notified by Ryanair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said: “The AAIB has commenced an investigation into a serious incident involving an aircraft which was diverted from Prestwick to Manchester Airport on Friday 3 October. AAIB inspectors have begun making inquiries and gathering evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Boeing 737-800 can carry up to 189 passengers. One person on board recounted what is thought to have been a two-hour attempt to make a safe landing, saying the plane made two attempts to land at Prestwick, before heading for Edinburgh and finally Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everyone was calm until the descent; we were being buffeted around a lot and jumping. There were a few worried people on the second descent as we could feel the plane was struggling,” Alexander Marchi told the Ayr Advertiser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Then the pilot surprised us by saying he was going to attempt Edinburgh. This was just as bad, though, as the second time at Prestwick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There was turbulence over the Firth of Forth and then as we approached the airport, as we were very close to landing, again we had to pull up sharply.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The passengers were taken from Manchester to Prestwick, arriving 10 hours later than the scheduled arrival time of 6pm on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One pilot who reviewed the log said: “Just imagine that whenever you land with less than 2T (2,000kg) of fuel left you start paying close attention to the situation. Less than 1.5T you are sweating. But this is as close to a fatal accident as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Does our “need for speed” make our Wi-Fi suck?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Yep.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge among Wi-Fi professionals that using 20 MHz or 40 MHz channel widths when planning 5 GHz networks offers the best overall experience for enterprise networks. This is because enterprise networks can often cover large footprints and need higher density for many connected devices. Using narrower channel widths provides many more available channels for building out networks with appropriate channel reuse and allows flexibility to avoid co-channel interference from noisy neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residential and small business Wi-Fi challenges are not so different. The average US household has 21 Wi-Fi devices1. Many homes require multiple mesh nodes or access points to cover effectively. Users in dense urban areas face many nearby access points using wide channels. Although Wi-Fi networks built by seasoned professionals typically use narrower channels, consumer Wi-Fi devices from popular manufacturers and ISPs utilize 80 MHz or wider channel widths by default. Popular routers and mesh systems from large manufacturers can even default to 40 MHz channels for 2.4 GHz networks (some not even allowing you to change to 20 MHz), utilizing two-thirds of the available spectrum!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because consumers have been conditioned to understand only raw speed as a metric of Wi-Fi quality and not more important indicators of internet experience such as responsiveness and reliability. If manufacturers shipped Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems that utilized more reasonable 40 MHz-wide 5 GHz channels out of the box, consumers would return the products when their favorite speed testing tool showed no improvement in speed over their previous system. Similarly, ISPs are reluctant to configure consumer premise equipment (CPE) to use narrower channels by default to reduce adjacent-channel and co-channel interference, as this will decrease the maximum achieved speed and hurt their standings in network performance benchmarks that emphasize raw speed over a rock solid and consistent Wi-Fi experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;But wait. It gets worse.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only does consumer and telecoms marketing’s heavy focus on speed hamstring ISPs and device manufacturers when it comes to delivering excellent in-home Wi-Fi, but the very act of performing speed tests negatively impacts experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, here is a 1-minute summary of an iPhone’s responsiveness connected to a Wi-Fi 6 router connected directly to a symmetrical 1 Gbps fiber connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, an important concept in Wi-Fi is that of airtime contention: basically, only a single device can “talk” at a time on a given channel2. So if one device is generating a considerable amount of unnecessary traffic, say from taking an internet speed test, substantial airtime contention occurs. Let’s connect a laptop to the same Wi-Fi router, take an internet speed test, and observe the impact on responsiveness from the same iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see material increases in latency, jitter, and packet loss, resulting in a doubling of the effective Lag. Of course, this does not prove that airtime contention is the cause, as there may be other factors such as buffer bloat. So let’s have the laptop perform the speed test via a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resulted in no material impact compared to the idle state, demonstrating that the speed testing activity was in fact the cause of the degraded experience from airtime contention and other Wi-Fi factors. In fact, the router is running FQ_Codel to mitigate non-Wi-Fi variables. With FQ_Codel disabled, the combined airtime contention and buffer bloat results in even greater degradation of experience when running a speed test: 1.5% packet loss, 13 ms jitter, and 113 ms peak lag. Considering the majority of consumer-grade equipment does not ship with buffer bloat mitigations enabled, this more accurately represents the general consumer Wi-Fi experience when an internet speed test is active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many ISPs, device manufacturers, and consumers automate periodic, high-intensity speed tests that negatively impact the consumer internet experience as demonstrated. Further, static probes that connect to Wi-Fi networks to measure maximum throughput are contributing to both buffer bloat and airtime contention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18% of US households experienced Wi-Fi issues on a daily basis, 20% on a weekly basis, and 68% reported issues in the past year3. But until consumers, the press, and industry understand that responsiveness and reliability are the largest drivers of their Wi-Fi experience, not speed, there will be little appetite from device manufacturers and ISPs to focus on solutions that result in truly great home Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8) working group has acknowledged the need for a shift in focus, framing the standard’s goals differently from past generations: not chasing ever-higher peak speeds, but improving reliability, lower latency (especially at the 95th percentile), reduced packet loss, and robustness under challenging conditions (interference, mobility).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the standard is not projected to be finalized until 2028. Near-term, the availability of Wi-Fi bands in the 6 GHz range will also help provide an even better balance of speed, responsiveness, and reliability with the ability to use wider bands while minimizing co-channel interference. However, this only offers another “lane” and does not eliminate the inherent problem of data-hungry devices cannibalizing precious air time. And, as analysis from Opensignal in conjunction with Hamina Founder &amp;amp; CEO Jussi Kiviniemi demonstrates, 6 GHz penetration remains low due to network and user equipment lagging behind on Wi-Fi 6E and 7 adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t have to wait until there is material Wi-Fi 6E and 7 penetration (or the unrealized promises of Wi-Fi 8) in the market to make progress—we can do so much better with the hardware already deployed with configuration changes if we can simply stop chasing the maximum possible throughputs and instead focus on Wi-Fi responsiveness and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, are standard internet speed tests bad? Of course not! They are a tool, and when used for an appropriate task, such as validating provisioned speeds are achievable by a network or client, they are incredibly useful. But we tend to over-use speed testing tools for all connectivity-related troubleshooting activities due to a historical lack of available user-friendly utilities and industry focus on "megabits per second".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t a matter of education: consumers know they want responsive and reliable Wi-Fi networks for the use cases of today. Instead, we need tooling and data to show consumers the metrics they care about most in an easily digestible form and make them readily available. Modern monitoring tools that measure continuous network experience—not just point-in-time speed—give manufacturers and ISPs the opportunity to compete on metrics that actually improve Wi-Fi rather than degrade it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Footnotes&lt;lb/&gt;1Journal of Consumer Affairs, April 2024&lt;lb/&gt;2This is an oversimplification given newer features such as OFDMA, but due to the nature of speed testing, the activity will demand large RUs or the entire channel. The scheduler also introduces overhead. And, as we will show, adoption of newer standards is low.&lt;lb/&gt;3TechSee data via Telecompetitor, September 2025&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Jordan Fulghum, October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Albums you can hold again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was 10, I blew every dollar I had on CDs. I remember sitting cross-legged on my floor, flipping through jewel cases, memorizing liner notes and lyrics, and most importantly developing my own taste for music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My 10-year-old doesn't have that. Music just sort of... happens. It's like it's infinite and invisible at the same time, playing from smart speakers, car stereos, my phone. Endless perfectly curated playlists, designed to fade into the background. The default listening experience has become both literally and figuratively formless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I thought: what's the modern equivalent of that CD browsing experience? Maybe what's missing is something tangible that he can flip through, or even collect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could combine my old CD-collector brain with today's tech: take something fun and collectable (trading cards), dress them up with album art, and add NFC tags so they can be tapped to play the album on our home speaker system, all without a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Away I went.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I needed to get the music into a format that could be played. I've long since surrendered to streaming, but I still have my MP3s organized via Plex on my home server. Funny to think that these files are the same MP3s that I've been collecting since the late 90s. I wanted the NFC tag to be deep-linked to those same files instead of a streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But which albums do I pick? I had the idea to create themed "packs" of albums. The first pack is obviously "Albums That Dad Wants You to Listen To", and it's just a bunch of dad rock. But the idea is that each pack can be a different theme or genre, and he can build his own collection (and develop his own taste) over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found a PDF template that matched the dimensions of trading cards, hopped into Canva and got to work. It was easy enough to find high-quality album cover images from Google, but....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was quite far into this project when I remembered the obvious fact that album art is square but trading cards are rectangular. Trading cards use a 2.5:3.5 aspect ratio, which is...not a square! Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at what they did for cassette tapes (also rectangular) back in the day, but their solutions were all over the place, from just cropping the square into a rectangle (gross) to having a giant white space next to the square art. That wasn't gonna cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I used an AI diffusion model to extend each album's art into a trading card aspect ratio. The AI was (mostly) able to extend the artwork while maintaining the original style and composition. Not perfect, but a pretty fun solution not possible just a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After ordering a bundle of blank NFC tags from Amazon, I learned that PlexAmp oddly has first-class support for zapping NFC tags to specific albums in auto play mode. A strange feature, but perfect for this project. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I printed the cards on our crappy HP inkjet printer at home. I used label paper that exactly matched the dimensions of trading cards, but after the fact, I realized it was kind of unnecessary. You can just print on cardstock if you have a digital template file. I cut them out and glued them to blank playing cards, but not before wedging the NFC tags between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For placement, I found a trading card display model from Makerworld and 3D printed it on my A1. It turned out alright!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once it was all working and in decent shape, I presented them in a nice neat arrangement to my son. He flipped through them like Pokémon cards, examined the cards that were the most visually interesting. Daft Punk's Discovery was his first pick. He grabbed it, flipped it around, tapped it, and that One More Time loop dropped throughout our entire house. Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was happy to see that the physical cards encouraged active listening and ownership. Instead of music being background noise, it became something he could choose, hold, explore, maybe even trade with this sister!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we're unintentionally teaching our children to consume music passively. My goal with this project was to teach them to discover it actively, to own it, to care about it at the album level. I think it kinda worked!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to Save the World With ZFS and 12 USB Sticks: 4th Anniversary Video Re-Release Edition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 4 years ago, a few colleagues and myself got together and we created a short video about the coolness of two of the most innovative products from Sun of the last decade: ZFS and the X4500 Server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, nearly 4 years later, the video has been downloaded more than 100,000 times (across the original German and the English dubbed version, plus the full resolution downloadable files) and shown to a lot more people during tradeshows, customer demos, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now YouTube and Google Video (remember?) donât allow for highest video quality and the old Sun Mediacast server, where we hosted the original MP4 file, no longer exists. Instead, Vimeo has emerged as my video hoster of choice for a variety of projects (check out my video collection on Vimeo) and so it was time to give this video a new home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For your viewing pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watch the English dubbed version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or if you understand German (or have a taste for movies in original language), watch the original:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original CSI:Munich blog post explains some of the technical background of the video, as does its German counterpart post âSolaris ZFS auf 12 USB-Sticks: Ein âThumperâ fÃ¼r Arme!â.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs amazing to see how far ZFS has made it today. Still, thereâs no other file system I know of that can be configured in seconds, provides data integrity at mathematically deep levels, implements database-like transaction safety, comes with a high-end featureset and gives you so much as ZFS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the possibilities of ZFS continue to expand. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangled is a new social-enabled Git collaboration platform, built on top of the AT Protocol. We envision a place where developers have complete ownership of their code, open source communities can freely self-govern and most importantly, coding can be social and fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several models for decentralized code collaboration platforms, ranging from ActivityPub’s (Forgejo) federated model, to Radicle’s entirely P2P model. Our approach attempts to be the best of both worlds by adopting atproto—a protocol for building decentralized social applications with a central identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach to this is the idea of “knots”. Knots are lightweight, headless servers that enable users to host Git repositories with ease. Knots are designed for either single or multi-tenant use which is perfect for self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi at home, or larger “community” servers. By default, Tangled provides managed knots where you can host your repositories for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The App View at tangled.sh acts as a consolidated “view” into the whole network, allowing users to access, clone and contribute to repositories hosted across different knots—completely seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangled is still in its infancy, and we’re building out several of its core features as we dogfood it ourselves. We developed these three tenets to guide our decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ownership of data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low barrier to entry&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No compromise on user-experience&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaborating on code isn’t easy, and the tools and workflows we use should feel natural and stay out of the way. Tangled’s architecture enables common workflows to work as you’d expect, all while remaining decentralized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that atproto has greatly simplfied one of the hardest parts of social media: having your friends on it. Today, we’re rolling out invite-only access to Tangled—join us on IRC at &lt;code&gt;#tangled&lt;/code&gt; on
libera.chat and we’ll get you set up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: Tangled is open to public, simply login at tangled.sh/login! Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For those who didn’t catch my blog post last week (pls read), we manufactured 2,960 white Pebble 2 Duos in September! Pretty good for the first month of production. These watches are being transferred to our fulfillment center and will be shipped out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black Pebble 2 Duo production did not start until the end of September, and then got interrupted by a China/Hong Kong holiday. Extremely sorry for the delay on black!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Time 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One fun piece of Pebble Time 2 software development news - we added a feature to make existing Pebble watchfaces/apps now (optionally) scale up to fill larger and higher resolution Pebble Time 2 display! Previous generation Pebble rectangular displays measured 144x168 pixels in 1.26" diagonal, but Pebble Time 2 is 200x228 pixels in 1.5", existing faces/apps would have had a black border on PT2. Many thanks to Alina for posting this idea on Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is fantastic because it will allow all older apps/faces to fill up the whole screen. Even better though, many Pebble developers are already upgrading their apps/faces to support the bigger screen natively, like Lignite’s beautiful face Mosaic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Time 2 hardware development is going pretty well. We finished EVT (engineering verification test) and we’re now heading into the DVT (design verification test) stage. We’re still working on a number of tasks like tuning the stainless steel PVD hard coating, testing water resistance, integrating our firmware test suite into the factory ERP and more fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schedule-wise, we’re behind where I would have liked to be in October. We’re now aiming to start mass production just around the end of the year (12/26 to be precise). That means December pre-orders will not ship out until January at the earliest. We’ll try our best to catch up, but the other looming date is the start of the lunar new year (factory shuts down Feb 1 through 17). We’ve got our work cut out for us! We’ll get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those of you who forgot or weren’t around 10 years ago, one of the most awesome parts of Pebble is the huge selection of fun/quirky/beautiful/clever/useful apps and watchfaces (from here I’ll just call them both ‘apps’). These were made by an extraordinarily talented community of casual developers, who primarily built apps for themselves and shared them with the broader public. This was facilitated by a damn good SDK, APIs, devtools and documentation created by the friendly and talented software and devrel teams at Pebble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the ease of development and hackability of Pebble truly made the world a better place, one little app at a time. I love hearing stories from people who first learned how to program on a free Pebble they got from a hackathon (we gave away thousands this way). Books were written. Toolswere created. My then-girlfriend now-wife (a biochemistry professor) even learned Pebble.JS to create an amino acid flash card app for her students! Yes, we are nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 2,000 apps and 10,000 watchfaces were created and hosted on the Pebble Appstore. It’s time to get (re)acquainted with them - browse away on apps.rePebble.com!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All existing Pebble apps are compatible with the new watches, though some apps may not work anymore due to broken settings pages, obsolete APIs, etc. Hopefully as we ship out more new watches, some developers will re-emerge to rescue some of these apps. I’m sure new apps will also rise to fill any voids!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are your favourite Pebble apps and watchfaces? Share links to your favs in the comment section below!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last 9 years, the Rebble Alliance has been keeping the Pebble dream alive. Many of you have used their web services, Discord, helpful instructions or dev portal. I’m a huge fan - I’ve been a daily active user since 2017. Without Rebble, it’s unlikely that the Pebble community would be as in-tact as it is today. On top of that, several members of the Rebble (and ex-Pebble colleagues) were absolutely critical in helping Google open-source PebbleOS. Without the community or the OS, there is zero chance that these new watches would be possible! Thank you Rebble!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One other great thing that Rebble did was in 2017 - they archived and started hosting a copy of the Pebble Appstore, before the servers were shut down. New apps uploaded by developers since 2017 have also been popping up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have partnered with Rebble to re-introduce the appstore. Their web services now power the Pebble appstore backend. New apps submitted via dev-portal.rebble.io will show up on Pebble Appstore as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You won’t need a subscription with Rebble in order to access the Appstore. Core Devices is funding Rebble, a non-profit, directly to provide this service. You can still donate or subscribe to Rebble and support their community efforts!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pebble Appstore now lives on apps.rePebble.com. The web view looks, feels and generally is the same as in 2016, with a few new tweaks and improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social link previews - share your favourite watchfaces on WhatsApp, Twitter, Bluesky, Discord, etc! Like PebbleEye 007&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar Apps/Recommendations - while building this feature, I was reminded about the true depth of the Pebble app catalog. It’s easy to get caught up in the ‘most hearted’ section…use this new feature at the bottom of each app page to discover hidden gems! It’s not perfect, but it’s helped me discover some awesome apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’re thinking about adding new features like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click to try out the app in an emulator&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detecting and warning users about broken APIs and settings pages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More and better categories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better discovery and recommendations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highlighting less-hearted apps (give new apps a chance vs old ones with a lot of hearts)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What new features should we add next? Add a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of our goals with this next phase of Pebble is to nurture and facilitate an awesome, easy and dare-we-say fun developer experience for the Pebble developer community. Part of what made the experience so awesome before was the developer relations team! We unfortunately do not have the resources to recruit the whole team back (though I wish we could!). Luckily many of the great decisions they made continue to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great news is that over the summer, we had an insanely productive intern on our team. He dusted off the SDK, updated it from Python2 → 3 and even built a CloudPebble-like way to build Pebble apps entirely in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s working now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try the Pebble SDK! Tested on Mac, Windows (WSL) and Linux&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or use the Cloud IDE → build hello-world and see it on an emulator, all in your browser, in under 2 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build an app with AI → run pebble new-project --ai then open dir in Claude Code or Cursor (etc) and prompt your way to your own custom app or watchface&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgrade your apps to support the larger 200x228 px display on Pebble Time 2, run it on the emulator using pebble install --emulator emery (just like Obsidian!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s on the SDK roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble packages support in SDK&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding Timeline support into the Pebble mobile app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New APIs for barometer, touchscreen, speaker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JS SDK - brand new, powered by Moddable. This will replace Rocky.js&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;October 10, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve been hinting on X/Twitter about my use of the Daylight DC-1 as a programming environment, and after about a year of use, itâs time to write about it in longer form. This isnât a full product review, but rather an experience report on coding in sunlight. Itâs also about the Boox Tab Ultra â which has a different type of display â and how it compares to the DC-1 for my use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a sponsored post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I even bother, you might ask? Sunlight makes me energetic and alert, which I need when I work. Living in the Nordics, 50% of the year is primarily dark, so any direct daylight I can get becomes really important. I usually run light mode on my Framework laptop during the day, but working in actual daylight with these displays, or plain old paper, is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the main components of this coding environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use a slimmed-down version of my regular dotfiles, because this setup doesnât use Nix. Iâve manually installed Neovim, tmux, and a few other essentials, using the package manager that comes with Termux. Iâve configured Termux to not show its virtual keyboard when a physical keyboard is connected (the Bluetooth keyboard). The Termux theme is âE-Inkâ and the font is JetBrains Mono, all built into Termux. Neovim uses the built-in &lt;code&gt;quiet&lt;/code&gt; colorscheme for
maximum contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certain work requires a more capable environment, and in those cases I connect to my workstation using SSH and run tmux in there. For writing or simpler programming projects (Iâve even done Rust work with Cargo, for instance), the local Termux environment is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I want to go really minimalist, so I hide the tmux status bar and run &lt;code&gt;Goyo&lt;/code&gt; in
Neovim. Deep breaths. Feel the fresh air in your lungs. This is
especially nice for writing blog posts like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My blog editing works locally in Termux, with a live reloading Chrome in a split window, here during an evening writing session with the warm backlight enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs the occasional Bluetooth connection problem with the 8BitDo keyboard. I also donât love the layout, and Iâm considering getting the Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue instead. I already have the wired version for my workstation, and the ergonomics are great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the Boox? Iâve had this device for longer and I really like it too, but not for the same tasks. The E-Ink display is, quite frankly, a lot nicer to read on; EPUB books, research PDFs, web articles, etc. The 227 PPI instead of the Daylightâs 190 PPI makes a difference, and I like the look of E-Ink better overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the refresh rate and ghosting make it a bit frustrating for typing. Same goes for drawing, which Iâve used the Daylight for a lot. Most of my home renovation blueprints are sketched on the Daylight. The refresh rate makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When reading at night with a more direct bedside lamp, often in combination with a subtle backlight, the Boox is much better. The Daylight screen can glare quite a bit, so the only option is backlight only. And at that point, a lot of the paperlike quality goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also get some glare when thereâs direct sunlight at a particular angle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if I donât write or program directly on the Boox, Iâve experimented with using it as a secondary display, like for the live reload blog preview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sum up, these devices are good for different things, in my experience. Iâve probably spent more time on the Boox, because Iâve had it for longer and Iâve read a lot on it, but the Daylight has been much better for typing and drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing Iâd like to try is a larger E-Ink monitor for my workstation, like the one Zack is hacking on. Iâm hoping this technology continues to improve on refresh rate, because I love E-Ink. Until then, the Daylight is a good compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How hard do you have to hit a chicken to cook it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some questions are timeless, innocent yet penetrating in their simplicity. Why is the sky blue? Why do things fall? How hard must one hit a chicken to cook it? It is this last mystery of the universe that we discuss today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a classic solution in which someone calculated that, if you slap a chicken at 3726 mph, it will be cooked. However, this analysis just calculates how hard you’d have to hit a chicken to get it to cooking temperature; you need to keep it at that temperature for it to cook. One slap won’t work unless you get it so hot that it cooks while it’s cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A real answer to this vital conundrum needs to consider how fast a chicken cools. A body at a nonzero temperature is constantly radiating energy as blackbody radiation; this is what you see in incandescent lightbulbs or when glass glows during glassblowing. To keep an object at a given temperature, you have to continuously give it the same energy it’s radiating away. A typical-sized chicken at 165 F is radiating away roughly 2000 watts of power, around 300 times the power used in a fluorescent lightbulb. To avoid losing any heat to contact with the air, let’s assume we dangle the chicken from a string in a large vacuum chamber. Let’s also assume you and a few friends are hitting the chicken with baseball bats like a pinata. In order to keep the chicken at 165 F for the minutes needed to cook it, it would be enough to have four people each hitting it once a second with a bat swung at 75 mph, about the speed with which a pro swings. Four major-league baseball players wearing pressure suits in a vacuum chamber each hitting a dangling chicken with a baseball bat once a second could cook it in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is Really Going on With All This Radioactive Shrimp?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the latest on how shrimp and spices were contaminated with cesium-137, how the FDA responded, and why experts say consumers shouldn't panic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, the Food and Drug Administration issued an unusual warning: Don’t eat certain lots of frozen shrimp sold at Walmart because they might be radioactive. It didn’t take long for the list of recalled products to grow far beyond Walmart. Over the past six weeks, hundreds of thousands of pounds of frozen, raw, and cooked shrimp have been pulled from supermarket shelves across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the affected shrimp share at least one thing in common: They were processed by an Indonesian firm known as Bahari Makmur Sejati, or BMS Foods. The company may not be well known to consumers, but from January to July, it was responsible for about a third of American shrimp imports from Indonesia—which itself is the third largest exporter of shrimp to the U.S., according to ImportGenius, a trade data analysis company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BMS Foods caught the attention of regulators earlier this year after cesium-137 was detected in its shipping containers and shrimp at four U.S. ports. It’s a synthetic radioactive isotope that’s not typically found in food but can be detected by the monitoring systems at U.S. ports. It’s produced during nuclear fission—the process of splitting an atom’s nucleus—which is often used to generate power or for nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past month, an investigation by Indonesia’s nuclear agency has found evidence of widespread radioactive contamination in the area where the shrimp was packaged, a region of the island of Java known as the Cikande industrial area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The situation is further complicated by the FDA’s September discovery of cesium-137 in a shipping container from Indonesia carrying cloves from a spice exporter over 400 miles away from the Cikande zone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The levels of radioactivity detected in both the shrimp and the cloves aren’t high enough to pose any immediate risk to consumers, and Indonesian authorities have stated that the country’s exports are safe. But on Oct. 3, the FDA announced sweeping new import requirements for all shrimp and spices from the island of Java—which is home to about 150 million people—and a nearby region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are more questions than answers at this point,” said Steven Biegalski, PhD, chair of the nuclear and radiological engineering and medical physics program at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Concerned Should You Be About Radioactive Shrimp?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Biegalski, consumers in the U.S. have no reason to panic. The activity concentrations found in the shrimp and cloves samples tested by the FDA—68 and 732 becquerels per kilogram, respectively—are well below the FDA’s intervention level for cesium-137 contamination, which is 1,200 becquerels per kg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Exactly Is Cesium-137?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cesium-137 is a radioactive isotope produced by nuclear fission, typically used in medical devices or the calibration of radiation-detection equipment like Geiger counters, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s also a byproduct of the processes used in nuclear weapons testing, the operation of nuclear reactors, and nuclear accidents. According to the CDC, people in the U.S. are exposed to low levels of cesium-137 on a daily basis because it’s present in the environment from weapons testing in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cesium-137 can take decades to break down in the environment, but the body processes it much faster. Ingested cesium is typically absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestines. In an adult, about 10 percent of ingested cesium-137 is excreted from the body in a matter of days. The other 90 percent has a biological half-life of 110 days, meaning the human body naturally eliminates half of what remains within about four months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Did Indonesian Shrimp and Cloves Get Contaminated?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not totally clear, but preliminary evidence suggests it’s because of industrial activity near food processing facilities rather than anything in the water or soil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officials from Indonesia’s nuclear energy regulatory agency have traced the source of contamination to a steel manufacturer in the Cikande industrial area known as Peter Metal Technology, or PMT. Some of the highest levels of contamination detected in the area were reportedly found in the company’s furnace, which is about 1.5 miles southwest of the BMS Foods facility where the shrimp was processed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigators think that radioactive dust was released into the environment after PMT inadvertently smelted scrap metal containing cesium-137. “Because it’s airborne, the contamination can be carried by wind,” said Bara Khrishna Hasibuan, a senior adviser to Indonesia’s Ministry of Food Affairs, at a Sept. 30 press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scrap metal was commonly used as a raw material by PMT, according to the Indonesian outlet Antara News. It’s unclear how it may have become contaminated with cesium-137. Biegalski, whose area of expertise includes nuclear forensics, told CR that the “easiest explanation” is that a medical or industrial device containing cesium-137 was inadvertently reprocessed as scrap metal. The radioactive material could have become gaseous after entering the PMT furnace and then been released from the facility’s smokestack, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That whole island likely had a cesium-137 plume go over it, leaving a trail of contamination,” Biegalski said. The Indonesian government is reportedly now considering new regulations on scrap metal to reduce the risk of further contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The release of a radioactive plume could explain the pattern of contamination in the area, according to Biegalski. Officials have detected elevated radiation levels in at least 10 sites within a roughly 3-mile radius of PMT so far, including the BMS Foods facility, and they’re working to decontaminate the region, a process authorities estimate will take several months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question of how the cloves were contaminated is harder to answer. The facility where they were processed is over 400 miles away from the smelter. Yet the radiation levels in the sample tested by the FDA were 10 times higher than those found in the shrimp. More perplexing still, a preliminary investigation found only normal background levels of radiation at the facility that processed the cloves, according to Antara News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of plausible scenarios here,” Biegalski said. “We don’t know where the [cloves] contamination occurred. It could have happened during transit, or it could have happened as an airborne plume, where things got picked up one day but didn’t necessarily gravitationally settle.” The plume could have also settled on the field where the cloves were grown or on the containers they were transported in, he suggested. But there are no clear answers yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Is the FDA Doing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Aug. 14, the agency placed BMS Foods on its import alert “red list,” effectively barring all of the company’s shrimp products from entering the U.S. until the problem is resolved. About a month later, it did the same to Natural Java Spice, the company responsible for the contaminated cloves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration has sent emergency teams to U.S. ports to evaluate the extent of cesium-137 contamination, an agency spokesperson told CR. Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency have also been in close contact with Indonesian authorities, who are monitoring the situation, said Joanne Liou, a spokesperson, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Friday, the FDA announced that starting Oct. 31, it will require import certification for all shrimp and spices from the island of Java as well as from Lampung province in Sumatra, northwest of the Cikande industrial area. Notably, this is the first time the agency has exercised this authority. The move extends similar restrictions to all regional exporters, who will be required to obtain shipment-by-shipment certification from the Indonesian government attesting that their products are free from radioactive contamination in order to be accepted at U.S. ports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is a good effort to try to stop the hemorrhaging of trust,” said Darin Detwiler, an associate professor at Northeastern University who has researched the FDA’s implementation of food safety policies. But he cautioned that this effort, like others in the agency’s past, could upset the balance of trade between the U.S. and Indonesia by introducing unnecessary barriers for exporters unaffected by the contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Consumers need to have trust in their [food] sources,” Detwiler said. “But we also need to look beyond the surface.” Over the past six weeks, elected officials and lobbying groups have used the spate of radiation-related recalls to advocate for policies restricting foreign imports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biegalski thinks that the FDA’s decision is reasonable and likely stems from concern over whether products with even higher levels of radioactivity than what’s been detected so far could inadvertently enter the supply chain. “We don’t want to scare the public over things that really are benign at this point,” he said, “but it would also be irresponsible if we didn’t continue due diligence and monitor what is coming in from the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Should Consumers Do?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FDA says no products that tested positive for cesium-137 have entered the U.S. marketplace, and the levels found in the shrimp and clove samples rejected at U.S. ports are too low to cause acute harm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of an abundance of caution, the agency has issued recalls for all products from BMS Foods that entered the U.S. after cesium-137 was first detected in shrimp. See this up-to-date list of the affected products and brands on the FDA website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure whether a product you’ve purchased is involved in the recall, check the packaging to see whether it lists a country of origin, said James E. Rogers, PhD, director of product and food safety research at CR. Food items will often include an “imported from” or “product of” disclosure on the packaging label near the ingredients list or nutrition facts box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t feel confident or safe eating a product,” Rogers said, “throw it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was first teasing Sony's "PS4 successor" and its "enhanced ray-tracing capabilities" powered by new AMD chips. Now that we're nearly five full years into the PS5 era, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls "a future console in a few years' time."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about "Project Amethyst," a co-engineering effort between both companies that was also teased back in July. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the "results are quite promising" for a project that's still in the "early days."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mo’ ML, fewer problems?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to "brute force that with raw power alone," Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind AMD's FSR upscaling technology and Sony's similar PSSR system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From the same source. Two branches. One vision.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My good friend and fellow gamer @cerny and I recently reflected on our shared journey — symbolized by these two pieces of amethyst, split from the same stone.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While that kind of upscaling currently helps let GPUs pump out 4K graphics in real time, Cerny said that the "nature of the GPU fights us here," requiring calculations to be broken up into subproblems to be handled in a somewhat inefficient parallel process by the GPU's individual compute units.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get around this issue, Project Amethyst uses "neural arrays" that let compute units share data and process problems like a "single focused AI engine," Cerny said. While the entire GPU won't be connected in this manner, connecting small sets of compute units like this allows for more scalable shader engines that can "process a large chunk of the screen in one go," Cerny said. That means Project Amethyst will let "more and more of what you see on screen... be touched or enhanced by ML," Huynh added.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The pope has condemned clickbait as a “degrading” part of journalism, at a private audience with global newswires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian media representatives were among those to hear directly from Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican on Thursday with about 150 members of newswire alliance Minds International.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first six months of his papacy, Pope Leo has been a proactive supporter of journalism as “a public good that we all should protect”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Communication must be freed from the misguided thinking that corrupts it, from unfair competition and the degrading practice of so-called clickbait,” he said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clickbait is a form of sensationalist, hyperbolic headline that entices online readers to click into a story by omitting key information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading a speech in Italian, the pope also highlighted the work of journalists reporting from the frontline in Gaza and across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Free access to information is a pillar that upholds the edifice of our societies, and for this reason, we are called to defend and guarantee it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Current events call for particular discernment and responsibility, and it is clear that the media has a crucial role in forming consciences and helping critical thinking”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pope also spoke about the challenges facing news media with the rise of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Artificial intelligence is changing the way we receive information and communicate, but who directs it and for what purposes? We must be vigilant in order to ensure that technology does not replace human beings, and that the information and algorithms that govern it today are not in the hands of a few,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He nominated “transparency of sources of ownership, accountability, quality and objectivity” as key to news media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I urge you: never sell out your authority,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pope cast a light specifically on the work of newswire reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One form of active citizenship is to value and support ... agencies that demonstrate seriousness and true freedom in their work ... a virtuous circle that benefits society as a whole,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Journalists working for news agencies are called upon to be the first to arrive on the scene and report on the breaking news. This is even more true in the era of continuous live communication and the increasingly pervasive digitisation of mass media.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News agencies deliver a service which “requires competence, courage and a sense of ethics”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is invaluable and must be an antidote to the proliferation of ‘junk’ information,” the pope said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
