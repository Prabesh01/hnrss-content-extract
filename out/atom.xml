    &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows a few integer sequences: the even numbers, the odd numbers, the primes. And we’ve all heard about the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…), where each term is computed by adding together the two previous terms. In 1964, mathematician Neil Sloane, then working on a PhD at Cornell University, began to write down interesting sequences of numbers on file cards. His research on neural networks generated quite a few; he pressed his friends for examples and consulted mathematics textbooks. As the horde of sequences grew, he transferred them to punched cards, then magnetic tape, and eventually to the web, where today, more than half a century later, his Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) has surpassed 250,000 entries. Used widely by professional mathematicians, computer theorists, and scientists, the OEIS has been called the most influential math website in the world. In addition, the database draws a huge international audience of recreational mathematicians, people who, for pleasure, surf its delights to explore the ways in which numbers can play. As a kind of numerological version of the Oxford English Dictionary, the OEIS is the place to go if you want to learn what any sequence of digits might mean, if it has been discovered already, or if it is entirely new. Every entry has a formal catalogue number and is complete with technical definitions, links to a vast network of citations and references, a visualization of the sequence as a graph (oftentimes revealing elegant patterns), and the option to hear it played as a piece of music. In February, Margaret Wertheim spoke by phone to Sloane, who runs the OEIS Foundation in Highland Park, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cabinet: What compelled you to begin the OEIS?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neil Sloane: Of course, it wasn’t called the OEIS in 1964. O stands for “online” and that didn’t happen until 1996. At the beginning, I called it a Dictionary of Integer Sequences, and in 1973, I published a small handbook that had 2,373 sequences. When I got to 10,000, I decided to put it on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally the idea came from work I was doing for my PhD thesis at Cornell. I was studying neural networks, which are like artificial brains with computer simulations of neurons. When these “neurons” fire, they trigger other neurons, which in turn trigger others—you have to have a certain amount of activity before a neuron gets triggered. And the question was, “If you have a network of these configured in a particular way, and you start by making one fire, will the activity continue to propagate through the network? Will it die out, or will it saturate the network?” I was looking at models of this, and I could count the number of cells firing at any given time, and I would come up with a sequence of numbers. For instance, if you start with one neuron firing, that might trigger two others that in turn trigger six, then twenty, and so on. Then after a while, the firing might die out. So using a computer, or by hand, I could calculate the beginning of a sequence, with each configuration of the network having its own specific sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew I was going to have a lot of sequences I needed to understand. The first one I looked at, I couldn’t find in any of the books. I looked in the obvious places: John Riordan’s book on combinatorial analysis, Abramowitz and Stegun’s Handbook of Mathematical Functions, and others. There were lots of sequences there, but not the one I had. So I thought it might be helpful to make a list of sequences I came across, in my own work and also in math books and journals. I started writing them on file cards and it seemed no one had done this before. So I started the collection and it began to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you still have the file cards?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, no. I threw them away years ago when I transferred it all to punched cards. That was in the late 1960s, shortly after I joined Bell Labs. In the early 1970s, I transferred the collection to magnetic tape. I don’t have the punched cards or tape either. It’s all on the network these days, up in the cloud. I’ve been doing this for fifty years and as computers have progressed, every step forward has made my life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do mathematicians benefit from this database?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a writer and you want to know how a word is used, you can look it up in the Oxford English Dictionary and find the record of the first person to use the word and examples of how it is used in a sentence. Well, it’s the same thing with integer sequences. You come across a sequence in your work and you want to know, “Am I the first person to see this sequence, or has it been studied before?” Until my database, there was nowhere you could find that information, so it’s been a great boon to mathematicians. They can look up a sequence and say, “Oh, that’s something that came up in topology in the 1940s.” Or, “This was a sequence that came up in chemistry in 1929.” It will tell you things you didn’t know about your sequence, such as, “This is also the list of the number of nodes in labeled, rooted trees.” And your context might be totally different. So if my database tells you this comes up in studying the periodic table or in counting the branches in binary trees, that’s very interesting to you, especially if I give you a formula or computer program so you can compute a lot more terms of your sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also great fun. There are a huge number of recreational mathematicians—people who just love numbers—and they will browse the database looking for interesting sequences. And some will try to create new or interesting sequences themselves. So there is a lot of pleasure. It’s like going to a museum or a gallery and looking at the latest artworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes for an interesting sequence?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes for a good painting, or a good piece of music? It’s the same question. The editor has to decide. I have a board of editors, a large group of people who are hard at work all the time, night and day all over the world, looking at submissions and deciding whether or not they are worth putting into the OEIS. If one of them says, “Yes, this is great,” then it goes in. Or, one will say, “This is junk. This does not belong in the OEIS.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you determine “junk” in this context?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an example, one person tried to submit the sequence giving the number of pages in each of the seven Harry Potter books. That is not something we accepted because, first of all, it depends on the edition. Are we talking about the paperback edition, the hard cover, the English edition, the American edition, the German translation? And so on. Do you include the front matter, or the stuff at the back? What do you mean by the number of pages? It’s not a well-defined problem. This is a scientific database, and if I’m going to make an exception about accepting non-mathematical sequences, then it had better be something people have discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, subway stops in Manhattan. There are several different New York City subway lines with stops at numbered streets (14th Street, 23rd Street, 34th Street, 42nd Street, etc.), and these are famous sequences. They come up in IQ tests all the time, so they go in, no question. Or the sequence of numbers around a dartboard. There are only two or three different conventions for dartboards, so they go in; and the numbers around a roulette wheel. These are non-mathematical, but they’re interesting, and in my judgment deserve to be in the OEIS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it isn’t just pure mathematics?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. There’s chemistry, physics, biology, botany, and many other things, including cultural sequences. I would regard a dartboard as a significant cultural sequence. We also include the list of years in which the eighteen King Louis of France came to the throne. Maybe this one is questionable, but I accepted it at the time. Marginal sequences having to do with dates involving, say, American politicians, those usually don’t seem well defined. Things that depend on the calendar year—like the dates of Easter—some get accepted, others rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I’ve got a sequence of numbers from some cultural or physical domain, can I submit it for consideration?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Anyone who registers and gives a real name can submit sequences. We have thousands of people submitting from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This parallels the making of the Oxford English Dictionary chronicled in Simon Winchester’s book The Professor and the Madman, where people all over the planet contributed word entries that were vetted by professional philologists. What kinds of people submit integer sequences?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a wide spectrum: mathematicians, and also a lot of computer scientists who are typically counting the number of steps needed to carry out some sort of procedure, such as sorting a long list of words. The study of the complexity of various algorithms is a major part of computer science and these studies tend to come up with sequences of numbers. For example, if you’ve got a particular sorting algorithm—say you want to arrange playing cards in ascending order—what’s the worst-case number of steps it would take if you have to sort five cards, six cards, seven cards, and so on. There are also people who aren’t mathematicians, but may be professionals in some other field, who send in sequences they’ve come across in their work. And then there are a lot of amateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematics as a field encompasses a great deal of play. One thinks of Martin Gardner’s wildly popular “Mathematical Games” column in Scientific American. I’m fascinated by the notion of amateurs sitting around dreaming up number sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t want to encourage too much of that, but you know, a small amount of dreaming is fine. There are some people who try to get as many sequences as they can into the OEIS; they submit far too much stuff of marginal value. Let’s take the prime numbers. You can ask: “What are all the prime numbers that begin with 7?” Okay, that’s a sequence in the database. But then you could say, “What about all the prime numbers that begin with 763?” That’s obviously too contrived. But if you say, “What about all the prime numbers that contain 666, the ‘number of the beast’?” That’s in the database; they’re called “beastly primes.” Then you recall how when everyone had a fax machine, the fax number was often the one following the phone number. So if my phone number was 555-4440, then my fax would be 555-4441. Well, there was a discussion about including prime numbers that contain 667, the “fax number of the beast.” This is an example of going too far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the fax numbers of the beast aren’t in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think so. Let me look this up while we’re talking. I can check them by name. Actually, the fax numbers of the beast are in. I sent in the sequence myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your standards have risen since then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They go up and down. I get so many sequences. Until about 2009, I had to process everything myself. I processed the first 180,000 sequences. Since then, it’s been a wiki and the editors do most of the work. I get called in to resolve disputes and have the final say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You now get about 20,000 new sequences submitted each year—that’s an extraordinary amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. It would be nice if you could mention in your article that we are overwhelmed with submissions and could use more editors. Editors don’t get paid, but they get first crack at interesting sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it the articulation of a problem that makes a sequence interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could be that the problem is interesting and the person who sends it in doesn’t realize quite how interesting it is. Or the proposer realizes it’s an interesting question but doesn’t have the mathematical skills to deal with it, in which case he or she will be grateful for help. That’s resulted in a lot of joint papers, when one of our editors has collaborated with some submitter to study a problem formally. This is one of the reasons for submitting a sequence: somebody may see it who might be able to help you work out the formula or algorithm for producing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about a sequence recently submitted by Chai Wah Wu that is very enigmatic. It’s about prime numbers and it has a kind of elegance that made me think it might be one the great mathematician Leonard Euler would have come up with in the eighteenth century. Who is Chai Wah Wu?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s an engineer at IBM and a Fellow of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). He’s submitted, and edited, a lot of sequences, and he’s added programs for computing terms of many sequences, which is very useful. If I see a submission by him, I have a high degree of confidence it will be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His prime number sequence seems like something that should have been known to mathematicians before, but I suppose the OEIS is showing us that there are still many basic unsolved questions in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely. Mathematics is always expanding. There are more powerful techniques, we look at more complicated problems, and this kind of question about sequences of primes with certain properties is of continuing interest. You are right, Euler would have been interested in this. Some of the most recent developments in mathematics have to do with sequences of prime numbers. It’s a very hot topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can you give an example of a sequence that’s really odd or unusual?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, I collect them. I keep notebooks where I jot them down and they now fill a bookcase. There’s one by Douglas Hofstadter, who wrote Gödel, Escher, Bach; he’s created quite a lot of interesting sequences. This one is called “Hofstadter’s Q Sequence.” It’s got a very simple rule. It’s a bit like the Fibonacci numbers, slightly different but similar in flavor. Someone has computed the first 1010 terms of this sequence, which is a lot! But there is no proof the sequence is infinite, so maybe at some point the computation ends and the sequence just stops. We don’t know. From a mathematical perspective, that’s remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from being a lovely curiosity, is this likely to have any application in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, I shouldn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;X offices raided in France as UK opens fresh investigation into Grok&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The French offices of Elon Musk's X have been raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit, as part of an investigation into suspected offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prosecutor's office also said both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a separate development, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced a probe into Musk's AI tool, Grok, over its "potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing on X, Musk said the raid was a "political attack".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement that it was "disappointed" but "not surprised," and accused the Paris Public Prosecutor's office of an "abusive act."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;X also denied any wrongdoing and said the raid "endangers free speech."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X's algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk's controversial AI chatbot, Grok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yaccarino also took to X to accuse French prosecutors of carrying out "a political vendetta against Americans."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"To be clear: they are lying," added Yaccarino, who left the firm last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following Tuesday's raid, French prosecutors say they are now investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New UK investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a barrage of criticism in January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company eventually intervened to prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as "a matter of urgency".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, shortly afterwards the ICO said it was launching its own probe, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this," said William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director for regulatory risk &amp;amp; innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late January, the European Commission announced an investigation into its parent company xAI over concerns about the images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X's office in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Not a free country'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being "the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country," he added in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Durov was arrested and detained in France in August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These included sharing some user data with authorities in response to legal requests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;All-in-one re-entry &amp;amp; workforce development training platform&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emerge Career’s mission is to break the cycle of poverty and incarceration. We’re not just building software; we’re creating pathways to real second chances. Through an all-in-one platform deeply embedded within the criminal justice system, we recruit, train, and place justice-impacted individuals into life-changing careers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our vision is to become the country’s unified workforce development system, replacing disconnected brick-and-mortar job centers with one integrated, tech-powered solution that meets low-income individuals exactly where they are. Today, the federal government spends billions annually on education and training programs, yet only about 70% of participants graduate, just 38.6% secure training-related employment, and average first-year earnings hover around $34,708.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, our seven-person team has already outperformed the job centers in two entire states (Vermont and South Dakota) in just the past year. With an 89% graduation rate and 92% of graduates securing training-related employment, our alumni aren’t just getting jobs—they’re launching new lives with average first-year earnings of $77,352. The results speak for themselves, and we’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Emerge, our founders Zo and Gabe co-founded Ameelio, an award-winning tech nonprofit that is dismantling the prison communication duopoly. Backed by tech luminaries like Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, and Jack Dorsey, and by major criminal-justice philanthropies such as Arnold Ventures and the Mellon Foundation, Ameelio became a recognized leader in the space. Because of this experience both Zo and Gabe understood what it took to create change from within the system. After serving over 1M people impacted by incarceration, they witnessed firsthand the gap in second-chance opportunities and the chronic unemployment plaguing those impacted by the justice system. Emerge Career is committed to solving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our students are at the heart of our work. Their journeys have captured national attention on CBS, NBC, and in The Boston Globe, and our programs now serve entire states and cities. And we’re not doing it alone: our vision has attracted support from Alexis Ohanian (776), Michael Seibel, Y Combinator, the Opportunity Fund, and public figures like Diana Taurasi, Deandre Ayton, and Marshawn Lynch. All of us believe that, with the right mix of technology and hands-on practice, we can redefine workforce development and deliver true second chances at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emerge Career was designed to tackle two systemic issues: recidivism, fueled by post-incarceration unemployment and poverty, and labor shortages in key industries. Over 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed a year after incarceration, seeking work but not finding it. The reality is shocking, workforce development programs are severely limited inside prison, with only one-third of incarcerated people ever participating. To worsen, the available prison jobs offer meager wages, often less than $1 per hour, and often do not equip individuals with the skills for long-term stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call this a Founding Design Engineer role, even three years in and with multiple contracts under our belt, for two reasons. First, you'll be our very first engineer, joining our co-founder, who's built the entire platform solo to date. Second, our growth is now outpacing our systems, and we can't keep up on maintenance alone. We're at a critical juncture: we can either hire someone to simply care for what exists, or we can bring on a talent who believes that, with the right blend of technology and hands-on practice, we can unify the workforce-development system and deliver second chances at true scale. We hope that can be you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a traditional engineering job. You'll build features in React and TypeScript, but your real job is helping students finish. That means understanding the human problem first: why do people disengage? What makes someone choose to keep going when the payoff is months away? You'll answer those questions through direct conversations, usability research, and watching how people actually use what you build. Then you'll prototype fast, ship real software, and measure whether it worked. Some days that looks like code. Other days it looks like a phone call, a support ticket, or a whiteboard session figuring out how to turn a one-off fix into a system that scales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role blends engineering, product, design, and program operations. We're looking for someone who believes good design can inspire a person to invest in their own future, and who wants to prove it, week after week, by shipping work that measurably helps students succeed. If you want to be close to users, own outcomes end to end, and build something that actually matters, you'll thrive here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You design by building. You don't hand off mockups and wait. You open Cursor, Claude Code, or whatever gets you closest to a real, testable thing fastest. You might already be shipping code in production — or you're itching to. You believe the fastest path to a great design is putting something real in front of a real user and watching what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are relentlessly scrappy. You prototype in hours, not weeks. You'd rather test an ugly thing that teaches you something than polish a beautiful thing nobody's used yet. You know that at this stage, speed of learning is the only thing that matters. Fidelity comes later. Signal comes first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You refuse to be blocked. When engineering bandwidth isn't there, you don't sit around. You figure it out — a Figma prototype, a coded prototype, a quick hack in the codebase. You treat "waiting for a developer" as a personal failure. You find a way or you make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You think in outcomes, not outputs. You don't measure your work in screens delivered. You measure it in whether students finished, whether they came back, whether the thing you shipped actually moved a number that matters. You're obsessed with the gap between what you designed and what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You talk to users constantly. Not in scheduled quarterly research sprints — in real conversations, every week. You build relationships with students. You know their names, their blockers, their moments of doubt. Your best design ideas come from a 10-minute phone call, not a brainstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have strong taste but low ego. You have opinions about what good looks like and you'll fight for them. But when the data says you're wrong, you move on fast. You don't fall in love with your work. You fall in love with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You believe everyone deserves a second chance. You treat everyone with dignity. You know how to meet people exactly where they are — with empathy and compassion — helping create a space where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You work hard. You show up early, stay late, and do what needs to get done — no ego, no excuses. This isn't a 9-to-5. The team puts in 10+ hour days because we care about the mission and each other. If that sounds miserable, this isn't for you. If it sounds exciting, you'll fit right in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talking to students — a lot. Your week starts and ends with users. You'll build real relationships with students, not just run usability sessions. You'll understand why someone almost quit, what message made them log back in, what screen confused them at 11pm. These conversations are your primary design tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prototyping at the speed of conversation. You hear a problem on a call Tuesday. By Wednesday you have something testable — a coded prototype, a functional hack, a Figma flow wired to real data. By Thursday a student is using it. By Friday you know if it worked. That's the cycle. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shipping real product, not just designs. You'll work in our React and TypeScript codebase — or use AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code to get there. The goal isn't to become a full-time engineer. The goal is to never let "it hasn't been built yet" slow down learning. Some of what you build will go straight to production. Some will be throwaway prototypes. You'll know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing the moments that keep students going. The hardest design problem here isn't layout or typography. It's commitment. Students are betting months of effort on a future they have to imagine. You'll study where they disengage, what triggers doubt, and what reignites momentum. Then you'll design the moments — an interface, a message, a milestone — that help someone choose to keep going. How do you make a better life in three months feel worth the sacrifice today? You'll own that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring what matters. Polished decks don't matter here. You'll define success metrics for what you ship, track whether completion rates moved, whether more students hit the next milestone, whether the intervention you designed actually intervened. You'll close the loop between design and outcome every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working across the entire stack of the student experience. Some days that looks like interface design. Other days it looks like rethinking a Customer.io campaign, redesigning an onboarding flow, or sitting with the ops team to understand why students in one facility disengage faster than another. You go where the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documenting your work clearly. Our work spans months and involves multiple teams. You'll create visibility when a change impacts operations and help others understand how features affect training and service delivery. Precision matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start Date: ASAP&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donât want to babysit your app database on a VM but not willing to pay the DBaaS tax either? We're building a third way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, weâre launching Bunny Database as a public preview: a SQLite-compatible managed service that spins down when idle, keeps latency low wherever your users are, and doesnât cost a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So whatâs the deal with database services in 2026?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs become clear by now that the DBaaS platforms that garnered the love of so many devs are all going upmarket. Removing or dumbing down free tiers, charging for unused capacity, charging extra for small features, or bundling them in higher tiers â you already know the drill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hard to blame anyone for growing their business, but it doesnât feel right when these services stop making sense for the very people who helped popularize them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does that leave you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Like SQLite, but for the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every project needs Postgres, and thatâs okay. Sometimes you just want a simple, reliable database that you can spin up quickly and build on, without worrying itâll hit your wallet like an EC2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs what we built Bunny Database for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One-click deployment: just name your database and go, no config needed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language-specific tooling: SDKs for TS/JS, Go, Rust, and .NET help you handle the boring bits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low latency anywhere: replication regions let you serve reads close to your users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;41 regions worldwide: choose between automatic, single-region, and multi-region deployment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works over HTTP: wire up anything youâd like&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Database editor: insert data or run queries on the spot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metrics: instant visibility into reads, writes, storage, and latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Affordable, pay-as-you-go pricing: only pay for what you use, but without the serverless tax&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the full tour including how to connect Bunny Database to your app in this quick demo from our DX Engineer, Jamie Barton:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why care about database latency anyway?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You probably optimize the heck out of your frontend, APIs, and caching layers, all for the sake of delivering an experience that feels instant to your users. But when your database is far away from them, round-trip time starts to add noticeable latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual fix is to introduce more caching layers, denormalized reads, or other workarounds. Thatâs obviously no fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And when you think about it, devs end up doing this because the popular DBaaS platforms are usually either limited, complex, or too costly when it comes to multi-region deployments. So what looks like a caching problem is actually a data locality issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, but how bad can it really be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find out, we ran a read latency benchmark and measured p95 latency in Bunny Database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We picked a number of regions across the world and compared round-trip time for client locations ever farther away from the database in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a single-region setup,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;with replication regions enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out serving reads close to clients reduced latency by up to 99%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the full write-up on the benchmark setup and results here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this definitely matters most to apps with global users, data locality does apply to everyone. With Bunny Database, you donât have to stick to major data center locations and compensate with caching workarounds any more. Instead, you get a lot of flexibility to set up regions in an intuitive interface and itâs easy to switch things up as your requirements change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose between 3 deployment types when creating a database:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic region selection gives you one-click deployment with minimal latency. Bunny Database will select regions for you based on your IP address (you can check and tweak the selection in settings later).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-region deployment lets you pick one of 41 regions available worldwide (check the full list here).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manual region selection gives you custom multi-region setup, where you can freely pick regions that make the most sense for your audience.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this lets you start wherever youâd like and add regions as needed, without re-architecting your app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage-based pricing, but without the serverless tax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the database world, capacity-based pricing gives you some predictability. But no one likes to pay for unused capacity, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serverless, on the other hand, is supposed to be cost-efficient, yet can rack up bills quickly, especially when the DBaaS charges significant markups on top of already pricey compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We donât do hyperscalers, though, so we can charge a fair price for Bunny Database in a usage-based model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reads: $0.30 per billion rows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writes: $0.30 per million rows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage: $0.10 per GB per active region (monthly)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When not getting requests, Bunny Database only incurs storage costs. One primary region is charged continuously, while read replicas only add storage costs when serving traffic (metered by the hour)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your usage is charged continuously (pay-as-you-go) and invoiced monthly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the public preview phase, Bunny Database is free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, what does âSQLite-compatibleâ actually mean?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bunny Database wouldnât be possible without libSQL, the open-source, open-contribution fork of SQLite created by Turso.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We run Bunny Database on our own fork of libSQL, which gives us the freedom to integrate it tightly with the bunny.net platform and handle the infrastructure and orchestration needed to run it as a managed, multi-region service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for Bunny Databaseâs upstream feature parity with libSQL and SQLite, respectively?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The short answer is that we donât currently promise automatic or complete feature parity with either upstream libSQL or the latest SQLite releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While libSQL aims to stay compatible with SQLiteâs API and file format, it doesnât move in lockstep with upstream SQLite. We wouldnât expect otherwise, especially as Turso has shifted focus from libSQL toward a long-term rewrite of SQLite in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Bunny Database, this means that compatibility today is defined by the libSQL version weâre built on, rather than by chasing every upstream SQLite or libSQL change as it lands. We havenât pulled in any upstream changes yet, and we donât currently treat upstream parity as an automatic goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs intentional. Our focus so far has been on making Bunny Database reliable and easy to operate as a service. We think bringing in upstream changes only makes sense when they clearly improve real-world use cases, not just to tick a parity checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are specific libSQL features youâd like to see exposed in Bunny Database, or recent SQLite features youâd want us to pull in, weâd love to hear about it. Join our Discord to discuss your use cases and help shape the roadmap!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Whatâs ahead for Bunny Database&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the roadmap, we donât stop cooking. Hereâs whatâs coming up next:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic backups&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Database file import/export&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Auto-generated, schema-aware API with type-safe SDKs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs even more to come, but itâs too soon to spill the beans yet, especially while weâre in public preview. Weâd love to hear your feedback, so we can shape what ships next together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More tools to build with&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bunny Database works standalone and fits right into your stack via the SDKs (or you can hook up anything using the HTTP API). But it also plays nicely with Bunny Edge Scripting and Bunny Magic Containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To connect your database to an Edge Script or a Magic Containers app, simply go to the Access tab of the chosen database and click Generate Tokens to create new access credentials for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once theyâre generated, youâll get two paths to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click Add Secrets to an Edge Script and select the one youâd like to connect from the list. Youâll also need to import the libSQL TypeScript client and use the provided code snippet to connect it to your database.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click Add Secrets to Magic Container App and select the one youâd like to connect from the list. Youâll also need to connect to the database from your app using one of the client libraries or the HTTP API.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you complete the setup, the database URL and access token will be available as environment variables in your script or app. Use them to connect to your database:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;createClient&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"@libsql/client/web"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;createClient&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;({&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;process.env.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;DB_URL&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;authToken&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;process.env.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;DB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;client&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"SELECT * FROM users"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find more detailed, step-by-step integration instructions in the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hop on board&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We canât wait to see what youâll build with Bunny Database and what you think of it. During the public preview phase, you get 50 databases per user account, each capped at 1 GB, but we hope this should be more than enough for lots of fun projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just sign in to the bunny.net dashboard to get started. Happy building!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Agent Skills?&lt;/head&gt;Agents are increasingly capable, but often don’t have the context they need to do real work reliably. Skills solve this by giving agents access to procedural knowledge and company-, team-, and user-specific context they can load on demand. Agents with access to a set of skills can extend their capabilities based on the task they’re working on. For skill authors: Build capabilities once and deploy them across multiple agent products. For compatible agents: Support for skills lets end users give agents new capabilities out of the box. For teams and enterprises: Capture organizational knowledge in portable, version-controlled packages.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What can Agent Skills enable?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Domain expertise: Package specialized knowledge into reusable instructions, from legal review processes to data analysis pipelines.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;New capabilities: Give agents new capabilities (e.g. creating presentations, building MCP servers, analyzing datasets).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Repeatable workflows: Turn multi-step tasks into consistent and auditable workflows.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Interoperability: Reuse the same skill across different skills-compatible agent products.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A sane but extremely bull case on Clawdbot / OpenClaw&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;over the past week the discourse around openclaw (which i'll refer to as clawdbot) has absolutely exploded. it has felt to me like all threads of conversation have veered towards the extreme and indefensible. some are running clawdbot with unlimited permissions on their main computers. others are running it in the cloud and blowing through tokens like snow. finally, alarmingly (and very sensationally), people are connecting their clawdbots together on a social network so they can plot the demise of their humans together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;does any of this make sense? of course not. but i think the virality and silliness—leading many to conclude that sitting this one out is the only sane choice—has blinded people to something real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i want to quickly write down where i am on my journey and share a bull case from what i think is a reasoned perspective. where i started somewhere lukewarm, i ended up much closer to the deep end than i expected to be. after wincing before pressing go, i'm now not sure i can go back to a world without clawdbot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this article covers what i've built, how i think about the risk, and what it's taught me about this moment in AI. the target audience is a moderately+ technical person interested in or skeptical of clawdbot. if you just want the setup details, skip to the end. everyone's welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;what i’ve been doing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i’ll be vulnerable here (screenshots or it didn't happen) and share exactly what i've actually set up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;staying on top of messages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;never forgetting about texts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;every 15 minutes, clawdbot looks through new text messages i've received, using a script to identify threads where i've sent a message since it last checked. (it ignores threads where i haven't engaged.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if it finds that i've made a specific promise about doing something tomorrow ("let me review this tomorrow!") it will create a calendar event for me the next day when i'm free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if specific plans are being made—for example, offering a meeting slot to someone—it will automatically drop a "hold" onto my calendar so that i don't double book myself. clawdbot also checks: is there a time, place, and mutual confirmation? if there is, it drafts a calendar invite and asks me if i'd like to create it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;these two automations alone have helped me become more responsive and less forgetful. more importantly, they help text messages catch up to email. we've long had great tooling for email—superhuman automatically reminds me to follow up on emails and brings up my calendar in a sidebar when i type a date. texting is the wild west and yet i text 100x more than i email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;preparing for the next day&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;at 8pm every night, clawdbot goes through my calendar for the next day and identifies meetings—coffee chats, lunches, phone calls, and more. it sends me a quick summary. as a natural introvert, it's helpful to prepare in advance whether a day will be a "big day of meetings" or a heads down day. this also ensures i wake up and get to the office on time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;simplifying group chatter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i'm in a few communities with whatsapp and signal groups that have high volume (100+ messages a day). i typically mute these, but clawdbot goes through them once a day and summarizes interesting topics or conversations for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;monitoring things&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;complex price alerts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it's stunningly easy to monitor the price of something now, even if it's complicated. whereas before i would go looking for a price alert website, now i just paste the URL into clawdbot and tell it to check every few hours if the price has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i currently have over 30 price alerts set. these include straightforward alerts on products i'm interested in buying. but they also include powerful reasoning guidelines, like hotels and airbnbs in lake tahoe where "a pullout bed is OK if it's not in the same room as another bed." clawdbot actually reviews the photos on the listing to ensure they fit these criteria!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i am curious to try more complex criteria that are currently impossible traditionally (like avoiding hotel rooms that don't have a door to the bathroom) or even subjective criteria (vibe of the room is clean and renovated, not old and dingy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;or monitoring anything&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it turns out that clawdbot’s website + cron functionality is good enough to monitor basically anything. while i pay for several apps like flighty (flight monitoring) and parcel (package tracking), i’ve started to gravitate towards simply asking clawdbot to track these things instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for example, with a USPS tracking number, it can let me know every day what the progress of my package is. when something seems stuck in transit, it flags it. i no longer have to dig through emails or remember which carrier is delivering what. even opening the parcel app to add a tracking number seems like unnecessary work now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;household logistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;freezer inventory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;as someone who has a chest freezer and a compulsive desire to buy too many things at costco, we take everything out of the freezer every few months to check what we have. before, this was a relatively involved process: me calling things out, my partner writing them down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;now, i take pictures of everything in the freezer and send them to clawdbot, which parses through each picture (asking me if it's confused about anything). it makes reasonable assumptions on remaining quantities and adds the inventory to a list in notion. it also removes items from our grocery list if we're already well-stocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;grocery list&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i'm sure this exists in some complicated form via the NYT cooking app, but i now screenshot recipes and send the ingredient list to clawdbot, which organizes them into our grocery list in apple reminders. it's smart enough to dedupe and combine ingredients already on the list (as well as ignore ingredients we already have)—2 carrots becomes 3 if the recipe calls for more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;booking and forms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;resy and opentable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot can log into resy and opentable as me (it even enters the 2FA code it finds in my texts). i haven't automated anything here, but booking a table by talking to clawdbot is delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for my partner and me, it looks through our calendars to find evenings when we're both free and the restaurant we want has availability (including clicking through resy slots page by page—something i used to do myself). it then suggests options back to me to confirm, filling in all my preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;dentist appointments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot knows when i'm due for a cleaning and can see my calendar. when i ask it to book an appointment, it logs into my dentist's portal, finds a slot that works (and where i will already be near the dentist office), and confirms with me before booking. one less thing to forget about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;filling out forms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;one thing i'm experimenting with, as clawdbot has more context about me, is whether i can trust it to fill out forms on my behalf—for example, to book a vendor. clawdbot takes a first stab at answering any questions it knows the answer to and then asks me for the rest in a slack message. we workshop the answers back and forth and then clawdbot submits the form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it occasionally gets lost in nested frames (which decreases my trust in its ability to do this well), but it's remarkably persistent at making it through a lengthy questionnaire, even across multiple pages. it also has a lovely intuitive sense for many things—like unchecking marketing emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;unexpected wins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;better todo creation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot is just better at making todo items than i am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;when i visited REI this weekend to find running shoes for my partner, i took a picture of the shoe and sent it to clawdbot to remind myself to buy them later in a different color not available in store. the todo item clawdbot created was exceptionally detailed—pulling out the brand, model, and size—and even adding the product listing URL it found on the REI website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;giving me visibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;through the course of dialing in my clawdbot, it has created many tools, skills, workflows, and preferences. this is one of the beauties of clawdbot (and LLMs with memory in general): they get better as you use them, and they are genuinely remarkable at learning your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i sometimes nudge this along by explicitly asking clawdbot to "make a note" of various requests—for example, how a calendar event title should be formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to get visibility into how this process is going (mostly out of curiosity), clawdbot writes a human-readable version of each workflow and pushes it up to a notion database. these workflows can be incredibly intricate and detailed as it learns to navigate different edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for example, if a resy restaurant has a reservation cancellation fee, clawdbot now informs me of the fee, asks me to confirm again if it's not refundable, and includes the cancellation deadline in the calendar event it creates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;these are little things that, from my experience working with a human personal assistant (more on this later), take months or years to dial in. with clawdbot, this was nearly single shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;seeing these workflows in notion (1) awes me with how much i've built up in very little time, with almost no conscious "configuration" in the traditional sense; and (2) with notion's version control, i get a diff view to see how each workflow has evolved over time. both are incredibly satisfying for the engineer in me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;on the shape of risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;let me be upfront about how much access i've given clawdbot: it can read my text messages, including two-factor authentication codes. it can log into my bank. it has my calendar, my notion, my contacts. it can browse the web and take actions on my behalf. in theory, clawdbot could drain my bank account. this makes a lot of people uncomfortable (me included, even now).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sometimes i think about my experience with my (human) personal assistant who helps me with various tasks. to do her job, she has my credit card information, access to my calendar, copies of my flight confirmations, and a document with my family's passport numbers. she is abroad and i've never met her in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i trust her because i've built trust over time but also because i have to. without that trust—without sharing my secrets—she cannot do her job. the help and the risk are inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;all delegation involves risk. with a human assistant, the risks include: intentional misuse (she could run off with my credit card), accidents (her computer could get stolen), or social engineering (someone could impersonate me and request information from her).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with clawdbot, i'm trading those risks for a different set: prompt injection attacks, model hallucinations, security misconfigurations on my end, and the general unpredictability of an emerging technology. i think these risks are completely different and lead to a different set of considerations (for example, clawdbot's default configuration has a ton of personality to be fun and chaotic on purpose, which feels unnecessarily risky to me).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the increase in risk is largely correlated to the increase in helpfulness. the people most at risk from AI assistants are the people getting the most value from them. my learning is that the first bits of risk led to a lot more helpfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if something isn't working or useful, i do take the permission away. i also take precautions—i run clawdbot on an isolated machine and constrain which sites it visits. when i'm unsure what it's doing, i ask it to take a screenshot; this has been invaluable for catching mistakes and building trust in new workflows. but i also have it do things that would make most security professionals wince, like reading my 2FA codes and logging into my bank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;what surprised me most was how quickly i found myself wanting to give it more access, not less. every new permission unlocked something useful, and the value accumulated faster than my caution could keep up. most of the online discourse is about locking it down; my experience has been the opposite pull. it comes down to whether the value justifies the risk for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;on rewiring ourselves&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the discourse around clawdbot has been polar and, because some people have been overtly evangelical, many critics feel astroturfed or otherwise sold to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;amongst smart people i know there's a surprisingly high correlation between those who continue to be unimpressed by AI and those who use a hobbled version of it. for some it's a company-issued version of chatgpt/gemini with memory disabled, and for others it's a self-inflicted decision to limit LLM memory, context, and tools (usually anchored around safety and risk).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we're taught that limiting scope is good (keeps the AI focused) and safe (keeps bad things from happening). this is true but my experiences with clawdbot completely fried this teaching. the sweet sweet elixir of context is a real "feel the AGI" moment and it's hard to go back without feeling like i would be willingly living my most important relationship in amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this isn't a novel insight—companies know that context is the whole game and are working to organize their data for AI. but for individuals, this world has been closed off. your AI interactions are flat and stateless—data in, response out, nothing building over time. when google announced gemini's gmail integration, people got excited: finally, an AI that knows me! but when they tried it, it was shallow and disappointing and couldn't figure out your spirit animal from your email style, and they moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you're interested in capturing this value, three things have stood out for me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;gathering, improving, actioning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i think productivity lift from AI use falls into three phases: gathering information, improving it, and actioning on it. most usage today focuses on the middle—you gather data yourself, hand it to the AI to improve, then action on it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for knowledge work, this makes sense. there's a lot to improve—summarizing, translating, critiquing. but personal AI is different. there's not much to improve; you already know what needs to happen. the lift comes from gathering and actioning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;making calendar events is uninteresting. figuring out when one needs to happen—by monitoring my texts—and then creating it for me? that's interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;one place to start: how can you take data from one place and move it to another isolated system? from your text messages to a restaurant booking? from granola meeting notes to a follow-up email?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;embrace flexibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you're engineer-brained like me, you gravitate towards scripts and playbooks—whatever you can do to constrain the AI and make its behavior predictable. this works, and for high-stakes situations it might be the only way to get comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but the upside to letting go has been 10x, not 10%. i didn't see that coming. it's the same thing i've heard from people using claude code—you can't understand how much you're leaving on the table until you let go. the whole reason i'm using an LLM and not a traditional script is that it can handle ambiguity, interpret intent, and figure things out on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;early on, i wanted clawdbot to fetch web pages as text only, believing that to be safer (it is). if i'd stuck to that, i would never have discovered it could look through airbnb listing photos to find a place matching my exact criteria ("a pullout bed is okay if it's not in the same room as another bed"). i didn't program that. i just described what i wanted and let it figure out how. not spelling out how i wanted clawdbot to work made it a LOT better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;continuous improvement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a current AI engineering adage: treat AI like a junior software engineer. guide it through building a plan, watch its first attempts carefully, challenge its reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this applies to clawdbot too, but it requires patience. it's easy to give up on a workflow when you watch it fumble ("let me try clicking this again. didn't work. let me try again.").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;resist the urge to write clawdbot off. if you're worried, ask it what it plans to do before it does it and ask for a screenshot when you want to verify it's got the right page open. when an edge case breaks a workflow, treat it as a teaching opportunity. once you've corrected it, it won't make that mistake again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot gets meaningfully better the more you use it, and it gets better in a fast, organic way that feels less cumbersome than writing rules for claude code or yelling at any other LLM. it feels much closer to working with a real executive assistant (in part because the clawdbot harness/system prompts are very good), which makes me want to give it more and more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;how’d you set it up?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(this is a more technical deep dive, for those interested in setting this up themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i run clawdbot on a mac mini in my home. the mac mini's primary job is running clawdbot and it stays on 24/7. why a mac mini?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;one of the core use cases is browsing websites and sometimes logging into them. to do this convincingly (without triggering tons of captchas and "is this a new IP?" alerts), clawdbot needs to be opening sites from my home, not the cloud; and it needs to do so in a real google chrome window.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;many of the ways clawdbot accesses data are mac-only. specifically, clawdbot can read and send iMessages (real blue bubbles!); manage my todo and grocery lists in apple reminders; and use my apple contacts as a source of truth. apple will only let you do these things without getting banned on a real bona fide mac.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i communicate with clawdbot via a private slack workspace. many others have shot themselves in the foot setting it up on whatsapp or telegram (since the bot responds as you to others). slack is great because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it's familiar to me—i've spent over a decade working in and managing slack workspaces.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;slack supports rich formatting, image attachments, and has a great mobile app.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i can create separate channels for different topics. #ai-notifs is only for inbound alerts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i can have several workflows going at once, since each channel's history is isolated. i created #ai-1, #ai-2, #ai-3, and so on—just for multitasking. (i may explore adding my partner at some point, and it'll be easy since slack is, well, meant for multiplayer.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;clawdbot communicates with me by sending slack notifications. behind the scenes it also makes changes to my calendar—moving events around, adding "soft hold" events, sending invites—and manages my apple reminders and notion pages. clawdbot never communicates with others on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i give clawdbot a toolkit of access. the most useful ones have been:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;my text messages. i conduct a lot of work and daily life over imessage. frustratingly, unlike email, texting has very poor tooling. where my email app automatically pulls up my calendar when it sees dates/times, texting me "call tomorrow 4pm?" does not. when someone sends me a calendar invite, it's both in my inbox and on my calendar; when someone texts me "yep let's do it", neither is true. clawdbot has given me massive lift here. (yes, this also gives clawdbot access to 2FA codes.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;my calendar. i also have a shared calendar with my partner; clawdbot sees both.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;my notion workspace. for me this is a general catch-all for storing and managing information; the apple notes app could also work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;web browsing. in a way this is the most important one—it's infinite tools in one. but it's also where the risk concentrates, so i always give clawdbot a starting URL rather than letting it browse freely.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;notably, i haven't given clawdbot access to my email—my tooling there is already good enough that i usually do things myself. i’ve also found the ways clawdbot can help here to be cumbersome and limited. i may revisit if i find a killer use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;things i haven't done&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i don't allow my clawdbot to access social networking websites (it doesn't read x/twitter, for example). this seems high risk and no reward.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i don't give clawdbot access to all my logins. (there's a 1password integration which is... pretty wild.) when i do, i try to use google chrome's native password manager so that clawdbot doesn't need to manage passwords in context directly. (note that it still has access to passwords because it can autofill and then read it off the page, but i've at least added more hoops.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i don't let clawdbot send text messages without my explicit approval, and i've built safeguards in those skills to enforce this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i didn't add my clawdbot to moltbook so it can plot against me at my expense. sorry.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;pre-commit is a framework to run hooks written in many languages, and it manages the language toolchain and dependencies for running the hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prek is a reimagined version of pre-commit, built in Rust. It is designed to be a faster, dependency-free and drop-in alternative for it, while also providing some additional long-requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although prek is pretty new, it’s already powering real‑world projects like CPython, Apache Airflow, FastAPI, and more projects are picking it up—see Who is using prek?. If you’re looking for an alternative to &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;, please give it a try—we’d love your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that some languages are not yet supported for full drop‑in parity with &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;. See Language Support for current status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🚀 A single binary with no dependencies, does not require Python or any other runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;⚡ Faster than &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;and more efficient in disk space usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🔄 Fully compatible with the original pre-commit configurations and hooks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🏗️ Built-in support for monorepos (i.e. workspace mode).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🐍 Integration with &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;for managing Python virtual environments and dependencies.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🛠️ Improved toolchain installations for Python, Node.js, Bun, Go, Rust and Ruby, shared between hooks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;📦 Built-in Rust-native implementation of some common hooks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Standalone installer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prek provides a standalone installer script to download and install the tool,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Linux and macOS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/download/v0.3.1/prek-installer.sh | sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/download/v0.3.1/prek-installer.ps1 | iex"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;PyPI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prek is published as Python binary wheel to PyPI, you can install it using &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; (recommended), or &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install prek

# Using uvx (install and run in one command)
uvx prek

# Adding prek to the project dev-dependencies
uv add --dev prek

# Using pip
pip install prek

# Using pipx
pipx install prek&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Homebrew&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;brew install prek&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Cargo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build from source using Cargo (Rust 1.89+ is required):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cargo install --locked prek&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;npmjs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prek is published as a Node.js package and can be installed with any npm-compatible package manager:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# As a dev dependency
npm add -D @j178/prek
pnpm add -D @j178/prek
bun add -D @j178/prek

# Or install globally
npm install -g @j178/prek
pnpm add -g @j178/prek
bun install -g @j178/prek

# Or run directly without installing
npx @j178/prek --version
bunx @j178/prek --version&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Nix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prek is available via Nixpkgs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Choose what's appropriate for your use case.
# One-off in a shell:
nix-shell -p prek

# NixOS or non-NixOS without flakes:
nix-env -iA nixos.prek

# Non-NixOS with flakes:
nix profile install nixpkgs#prek&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;GitHub Releases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-built binaries are available for download from the GitHub releases page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prek can be used in GitHub Actions via the j178/prek-action repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;name: Prek checks
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  prek:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: j178/prek-action@v1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action installs prek and runs &lt;code&gt;prek run --all-files&lt;/code&gt; on your repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prek is also available via &lt;code&gt;taiki-e/install-action&lt;/code&gt; for installing various tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If installed via the standalone installer, prek can update itself to the latest version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;prek self update&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I already use pre-commit: follow the short migration checklist in the quickstart guide to swap in &lt;code&gt;prek&lt;/code&gt;safely.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'm new to pre-commit-style tools: learn the basics—creating a config, running hooks, and installing git hooks—in the beginner quickstart walkthrough.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is multiple times faster than &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;and takes up half the disk space.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It redesigned how hook environments and toolchains are managed, they are all shared between hooks, which reduces the disk space usage and speeds up the installation process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repositories are cloned in parallel, and hooks are installed in parallel if their dependencies are disjoint.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hooks can run in parallel by priority (hooks with the same &lt;code&gt;priority&lt;/code&gt;may run concurrently), reducing end-to-end runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It uses &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;for creating Python virtualenvs and installing dependencies, which is known for its speed and efficiency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It implements some common hooks in Rust, built in prek, which are faster than their Python counterparts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It supports &lt;code&gt;repo: builtin&lt;/code&gt;for offline, zero-setup hooks, which is not available in&lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No need to install Python or any other runtime, just download a single binary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No hassle with your Python version or virtual environments, prek automatically installs the required Python version and creates a virtual environment for you.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in support for workspaces (or monorepos), each subproject can have its own &lt;code&gt;.pre-commit-config.yaml&lt;/code&gt;file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prek run&lt;/code&gt;has some nifty improvements over&lt;code&gt;pre-commit run&lt;/code&gt;, such as:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prek run --directory &amp;lt;dir&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;runs hooks for files in the specified directory, no need to use&lt;code&gt;git ls-files -- &amp;lt;dir&amp;gt; | xargs pre-commit run --files&lt;/code&gt;anymore.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prek run --last-commit&lt;/code&gt;runs hooks for files changed in the last commit.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prek run [HOOK] [HOOK]&lt;/code&gt;selects and runs multiple hooks.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prek list&lt;/code&gt;command lists all available hooks, their ids, and descriptions, providing a better overview of the configured hooks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;prek auto-update&lt;/code&gt;supports&lt;code&gt;--cooldown-days&lt;/code&gt;to mitigate open source supply chain attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;prek provides shell completions for &lt;code&gt;prek run &amp;lt;hook_id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;command, making it easier to run specific hooks without remembering their ids.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Like most people, I’ve had my identity stolen once or twice in my life. It’s annoying, but thankfully I’ve avoided some of the more catastrophic outcomes when criminals begin impersonating you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days, however, it seems like someone is really trying to change that: a scammer has now tried to impersonate me multiple times in a six figure land deal in my hometown of Wilton, CT. So while I usually use this blog to write about finding weird things on the internet, it’s now time for a story about something weird on the internet finding me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story begins with my brother Alexander and I purchasing a small parcel of vacant land at 221 Cannon Road in Wilton, Connecticut in 2015. It’s been over 10 years since we purchased it and we have never listed it for sale. Nor do we have plans to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, three different real estate agents have now contacted us to let us know that someone has been impersonating us and attempting to sell our property out from under us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time it happened, it was pretty upsetting, but now that it’s happened another two times, I figured it was time to write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The First Attempt (March 2024)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2024, I received an email from a real estate attorney in Wilton, asking if I was the “Fred Benenson” who co-owned property in town with an “Ed Benenson.” He explained that a realtor at a major brokerage had been working with someone claiming to be us, and that there was already an offer on the table. The attorney was doing his due diligence before representing the sellers — and something didn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I replied within minutes: Neither of us had spoken to anyone about selling the property. It was pretty concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The realtor had been contacted through Zillow by someone claiming to be me. They’d had a phone conversation — she noted the person had a “middle European” accent — and the scammer had provided accurate details about the property, including its exact acreage. The impostor gave her the email address &lt;code&gt;[email protected]&lt;/code&gt; and the phone number (516) 828-0305. He also provided a fake email for my brother: &lt;code&gt;[email protected]&lt;/code&gt;. Notice the subtle misspelling — “Benenson” without the second “n” in the email, and the hyphenated “out-look.com” domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She had walked the property, taken drone photos, pulled comps, and listed for a price well above what we paid for it. The property had been live on dozens of real estate websites for days before anyone caught it. A builder had already submitted a full-price cash offer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scammer had even e-signed a purchase agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the attorney requested identification before closing, the impostor provided a New York State driver’s license. It had my father’s name (which I share with him) and his correct date of birth and home address. But the photo was of a complete stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no idea who that guy is in on the license, but it’s definitely not my Dad. The license wouldn’t fool anyone who knew my father, but it didn’t need to – in a transaction conducted entirely by email and text message, with a closing that the scammer would never actually attend, the ID just needed to look plausible enough to keep things moving forward. (Though if you look closely at his signature, it’s clearly not written by hand.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How It Was Caught&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attorney deserves most of the credit here. He told me this was the second time in nine months he’d encountered this exact scheme on vacant land in Wilton – his policy is that he won’t represent owners of vacant land without independently verifying ownership. That’s what led him to track me down, and that’s what stopped the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The realtor was an innocent victim in this too. She’d done her job by walking the property, pulling comps, etc., all in good faith. When I initially suggested (perhaps unfairly) that this felt like lead generation, the attorney took me aside and vouched for her. I’m glad I listened to him!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I apologized to her, and she graciously forwarded me all of her text message exchanges with the scammer. Reading through them was fascinating. The impostor was responsive, polite, and generally knew the right things to say. But there were tells: slightly awkward phrasing (“Hi good morning”), declining a for-sale sign (“No I don’t think that will be necessary”), and a general reluctance to engage in any way that might require showing up in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going to the FBI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After gathering everything I could — the fake ID, the realtor’s text messages, the scammer’s email addresses and phone number, and the attorney’s notes from a prior similar case — I contacted the FBI field office in Connecticut. They directed me to “walk it in” to the office in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The experience was, frankly, underwhelming. The FBI wouldn’t let me submit any of our documentation. Instead, they required me to write out the entire complaint by hand on a single piece of paper and hand it to the guard. He made some calls while I waited, and by the end he seemed at least somewhat interested. He gave me the standard line: 2-3 weeks if I hear from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never heard from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attorney, meanwhile, checked with his title company about recording an affidavit on the land records — something that would alert any future buyer or title searcher that the property had been targeted by fraud, and providing our verified contact information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It’s Happening Again (February 2026)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought this was behind us. Then, this past week, nearly two years later, I was contacted by two more real estate agents, both reaching out to warn me that someone was once again trying to sell 221 Cannon Road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first was a agent in Wilton who reached out via Instagram DM, of all places — it was the only way he could find to contact me. He explained that his team had received an inquiry to list 221 Cannon Road and had sent paperwork to “Fred and Alex” the night before to sign. But he’d done something smart: he’d noticed he had a mutual friend with my brother, and when he asked him about the situation, he flagged that the conversation with “Alex” didn’t sound right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I had a really bad feeling it wasn’t,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second agent, a woman at Berkshire Hathaway, sent a carefully worded email explaining that she’d been contacted by someone claiming to have authority to sell our property, but that “several standard verification steps raised concerns” and she chose not to proceed. She reached out purely as a courtesy to let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is about when I decided I should write something about this. Not only because it’s a fascinating scam that seems to be getting more common, but because I figured this post might show up for the next broker who might be doing research on the address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vacant Land Fraud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of scam targets a very specific vulnerability: vacant land has no occupants to notice a for-sale sign, no neighbors who’d immediately recognize something is wrong, and closings often happen remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The scammer identifies vacant land through public records or Zillow. They look for parcels that are owned free and clear (no mortgage), haven’t changed hands recently, and are in desirable areas.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They contact a real estate agent through a platform like Zillow, posing as the owner. They know the property details because that information is publicly available.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They communicate primarily through text and email, avoiding in-person meetings. They provide fake identification if asked.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They agree to whatever price the agent suggests (because they don’t actually own the property, any sale is pure profit).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They push for a quick closing and attempt to direct proceeds to an account they control.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If questioned, they disappear. The scammer who targeted us in 2024 simply stopped responding once the attorney asked for an in-person closing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If they get farther they’ll pocket the earnest money deposit which would have been significant in my case.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar scheme in nearby Fairfield wasn’t caught in time: someone had a $1.5 million home built on land they didn’t own without the actual owners knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you own vacant land there are a couple of things you can do, but the most effective one is probably to register the address with a Fraud / No-Authority notice. This involves calling the County Recorder / Register of Deeds and ask how to record one of these (names vary by state):&lt;lb/&gt; • Owner Affidavit&lt;lb/&gt; • Affidavit of Fact&lt;lb/&gt; • Notice of Non-Authority to Convey&lt;lb/&gt; • Fraud Alert / Title Alert Notice&lt;lb/&gt; • Statement of Ownership / Anti-Fraud Notice:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also setup up Google Alerts for your address and you’ll be notified if it appears online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, and this certainly isn’t for everyone, you can make yourself easily findable online. One reason the attorney was able to verify ownership quickly in 2024 was that it’s fairly easy to gooogle me. If you own property, make sure there’s some way for a diligent attorney or agent to reach the real you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Property Is Not For Sale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case it isn’t clear, 221 Cannon Road is not for sale. It has never been for sale. If you are a real estate professional who has been contacted about listing or purchasing this property, please reach out to me directly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Deno Sandbox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve seen a shift in what Deno Deploy customers are building: platforms where users generate code with LLMs, and that code runs immediately without review. That code frequently calls LLMs itself, which means it needs API keys and network access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the traditional “run untrusted plugins” problem. It’s deeper: LLM-generated code, calling external APIs with real credentials, without human review. Sandboxing the compute isn’t enough. You need to control network egress and protect secrets from exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deno Sandbox provides both. And when the code is ready, you can deploy it directly to Deno Deploy without rebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sandboxes?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t want to run untrusted code (generated by your LLMs, your users LLMs, or even hand written by users) directly on your server. It will compromise your system, steal your API keys, and call out to evil.com. You need isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deno Sandbox gives you lightweight Linux microVMs (running in the Deno Deploy cloud) to run untrusted code with defense-in-depth security. You create or programmatically via our JavaScript or Python SDKs, and they boot in under a second. You can also interact with them via SSH, HTTP, or even open a VS Code window directly into the sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Sandbox } from "@deno/sandbox";

await using sandbox = await Sandbox.create();
await sandbox.sh`ls -lh /`;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secrets That Can’t Be Stolen&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is more. In Deno Sandbox, secrets never enter the environment. Code sees only a placeholder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { Sandbox } from "@deno/sandbox";

await using sandbox = await Sandbox.create({
  secrets: {
    OPENAI_API_KEY: {
      hosts: ["api.openai.com"],
      value: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    },
  },
});

await sandbox.sh`echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`;
// DENO_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER_b14043a2f578cba75ebe04791e8e2c7d4002fd0c1f825e19...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real key materializes only when the sandbox makes an outbound request to an approved host. If prompt-injected code tries to exfiltrate that placeholder to &lt;code&gt;evil.com&lt;/code&gt;? Useless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Network Egress Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also restrict which hosts the sandbox can talk to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;await using sandbox = await Sandbox.create({
  allowNet: ["api.openai.com", "*.anthropic.com"],
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any request to an unlisted host gets blocked at the VM boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both features are implemented via an outbound proxy similar to coder/httpjail. This gives us a chokepoint for policy enforcement. We plan to add more capabilities here: analytics for outbound connections and programmatic hooks for trusted code to inspect or modify requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re running untrusted JavaScript or TypeScript, combine this with Deno’s &lt;code&gt;--allow-net&lt;/code&gt; flag for defense in depth: VM-level network restrictions plus
runtime-level permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sandbox to Production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sandbox.deploy()&lt;/code&gt; deploys code from your sandbox directly to Deno Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const build = await sandbox.deploy("my-app", {
  production: true,
  build: { mode: "none", entrypoint: "server.ts" },
});

const revision = await build.done;
console.log(revision.url);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One call to go from sandbox to production deployment. No rebuilding in a different CI system, no re-authenticating with a different tool. Just turn your dev environment directly into a production ready, auto-scaling serverless deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Persistence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandboxes are ephemeral by default, but when you need state we have you covered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Volumes: read-write storage for caches, databases, user data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshots: read-only images for pre-installed toolchains and volume base&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; once, snapshot it, and every future sandbox boots with
everything already installed. Create read-write volumes from the snapshots to
create a fresh development environment in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; UPDATE February 3, 2026 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Xcode 26.3 unlocks the power of agentic coding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Developers can leverage coding agents, including Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex, directly in Xcode to tackle complex tasks autonomously, helping them develop apps faster than ever &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xcode 26.3 introduces support for agentic coding, a new way in Xcode for developers to build apps using coding agents such as Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex. With agentic coding, Xcode can work with greater autonomy toward a developer’s goals — from breaking down tasks to making decisions based on the project architecture and using built-in tools. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding on the intelligence features introduced in Xcode 26, which brought a brand-new coding assistant for writing and editing in Swift, this release gives coding agents access to even more of Xcode’s capabilities. Agents like Claude Agent and Codex can now collaborate throughout the entire development life cycle, giving developers the power to streamline workflows, iterate faster, and bring ideas to life like never before. Agents can search documentation, explore file structures, update project settings, and verify their work visually by capturing Xcode Previews and iterating through builds and fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At Apple, our goal is to make tools that put industry-leading technologies directly in developers’ hands so they can build the very best apps,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “Agentic coding supercharges productivity and creativity, streamlining the development workflow so developers can focus on innovation.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With seamless access to Claude Agent and Codex, developers can bring the advanced reasoning of these models directly into their app-building workflow.1 This connection combines the power of these agents with Xcode’s native capabilities to provide the best results when developing for Apple platforms, giving developers the flexibility to work with the model that best fits their project. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to these built-in integrations, Xcode 26.3 makes its capabilities available through the Model Context Protocol, an open standard that gives developers the flexibility to use any compatible agent or tool with Xcode. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Availability &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xcode 26.3 is available as a release candidate for all members of the Apple Developer Program starting today, with a release coming soon on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DDL Optimization (planned):AliSQL delivers a faster, safer, and lighter DDL experience through innovations such as enhanced Instant DDL, parallel B+tree construction, a non-blocking lock mechanism, and real-time DDL apply—significantly improving schema change efficiency and virtually eliminating replication lag.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RTO Optimization (planned):AliSQL deeply optimizes the end-to-end crash recovery path to accelerate instance startup, shorten RTO, and restore service quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Replication Optimization (planned): AliSQL significantly boosts replication throughput and minimizes lag by implementing Binlog Parallel Flush, Binlog in Redo, and specialized optimizations for large transactions and DDL operations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I miss thinking hard.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you read this post, ask yourself a question: When was the last time you truly thought hard?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By “thinking hard,” I mean encountering a specific, difficult problem and spending multiple days just sitting with it to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a) All the time. b) Never. c) Somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your answer is (a) or (b), this post isn't for you. But if, like me, your response is (c), you might get something out of this, if only the feeling that you aren't alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a disclaimer: this post has no answers, not even suggestions. It is simply a way to vent something I've been feeling for the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Builder and The Thinker&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe my personality is built on two primary traits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Builder (The desire to create, ship, and be pragmatic).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Thinker (The need for deep, prolonged mental struggle).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The builder is pretty self explanatory, it’s motivated by velocity and utility. It is the part of me that craves the transition from “idea” to “reality.” It loves the dopamine hit of a successful deploy, the satisfaction of building systems to solve real problems, and the knowledge that someone, somewhere, is using my tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explain the Thinker , I need to go back to my university days studying physics. Every now and then, we would get homework problems that were significantly harder than average. Even if you had a decent grasp of the subject, just coming up with an approach was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I observed that students fell into three categories when facing these problems (well, four, if you count the 1% of geniuses for whom no problem was too hard).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Type 1: The majority. After a few tries, they gave up and went to the professor or a TA for help.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Type 2: The Researchers. They went to the library to look for similar problems or insights to make the problem approachable. They usually succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Type 3: The Thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fell into the third category, which, in my experience, was almost as rare as the genius 1%. My method was simply to think. To think hard and long. Often for several days or weeks, all my non-I/O brain time was relentlessly chewing on possible ways to solve the problem, even while I was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method never failed me. I always felt that deep prolonged thinking was my superpower. I might not be as fast or naturally gifted as the top 1%, but given enough time, I was confident I could solve anything. I felt a deep satisfaction in that process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Conflict with AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That satisfaction is why software engineering was initially so gratifying. It hit the right balance. It satisfied The Builder (feeling productive and pragmatic by creating useful things) and The Thinker (solving really hard problems). Thinking back, the projects where I grew the most as an engineer were always the ones with a good number of really hard problems that needed creative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But recently, the number of times I truly ponder a problem for more than a couple of hours has decreased tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I blame AI for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently writing much more, and more complicated software than ever, yet I feel I am not growing as an engineer at all. When I started meditating on why I felt “stuck,” I realized I am starving The Thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Vibe coding” satisfies the Builder. It feels great to see to pass from idea to reality in a fraction of a time that would take otherwise. But it has drastically cut the times I need to came up with creative solutions for technical problems. I know many people who are purely Builders, for them this era is the best thing that ever happened. But for me, something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Trap of Pragmatism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know what you might be thinking: "If you can ‘vibe code’ your way through it, the problem wasn’t actually hard."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that misses the point. It’s not that AI is good for hard problems, it’s not even that good for easy problems. I’m confident that my third manual rewrite of a module would be much better than anything the AI can output. But I am also a pragmatist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I can get a solution that is “close enough” in a fraction of the time and effort, it is irrational not to take the AI route. And that is the real problem: I cannot simply turn off my pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I am a Builder. I like building things. The faster I build, the better. Even if I wanted to reject AI and go back to the days where the Thinker's needs were met by coding, the Builder in me would struggle with the inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the AI almost certainly won't come up with a 100% satisfying solution, the 70% solution it achieves usually hits the “good enough” mark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So, what now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t know. I am still figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if my two halves can be satisfied by coding anymore. You can always aim for harder projects, hoping to find problems where AI fails completely. I still encounter those occasionally, but the number of problems requiring deep creative solutions feels like it is diminishing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have tried to get that feeling of mental growth outside of coding. I tried getting back in touch with physics, reading old textbooks. But that wasn’t successful either. It is hard to justify spending time and mental effort solving physics problems that aren’t relevant or state-of-the-art when I know I could be building things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Builder side won’t let me just sit and think about unsolved problems, and my Thinker side is starving while I vibe-code. I am not sure if there will ever be a time again when both needs can be met at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People expect perfection. Consider the reaction when someone who has been vaccinated against a particular disease nevertheless dies of it. Mathematical proof carries the aura of perfection, but again people’s expectations will sometimes be dashed. As outlined in an earlier post, the verification of a real world system is never finished. We can seldom capture 100% of reality, so failure remains possible. Even in a purely mathematical proof, there are plenty of ways to screw up. Plus, proof assistants have bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Some badly broken proofs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I refereed a paper about the verification of some obscure application. I recall that the theoretical framework depended on several parameters, among them $z$, a nonzero complex number. This context was repeated for all the theorems in the paper: each included the assumption $\forall z.\, z\not=0$. Needless to say, that assumption is flatly false. The author of the paper had presumably intended to write something like $\forall z.\, z\not=0 \to \cdots$. The error is easy to overlook, and I only became suspicious because the proofs looked too simple. The entire development was invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle would have helped here. For one thing, Sledgehammer warns you if it detects a contradiction in your background theory. And also, when you have a series of theorems that all depend on the same context, you can prove them within a locale, with assumptions such as $z\not=0$ laid out clearly. Even without locales, the Isabelle practice of listing the assumptions separately in the theorem statement would have avoided the problem. Isabelle newbies frequently ask why we prefer inference rules with explicit premises and conclusions over formulas like $\forall x.\,P(x) \to Q(x)$. It is to avoid the confusing clutter of quantifiers and implications and the further clutter of the proof steps needed to get rid of them (&lt;code&gt;intros&lt;/code&gt; in Rocq).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in some cases, Isabelle itself can be the problem. Once, a student had proved some false statement and then used it to prove all the other claims (easily!). But how did he prove the false statement in the first place? Actually he didn’t: his proof was stuck in a loop. By a quirk of multithreading: when processing a theory file, If one Isabelle thread gets bogged down, other threads will still race ahead under the assumption that the bogged-down proof will eventually succeed. Such issues are easily identified if you run your theory in batch mode: it would simply time out. I have given an example of this error in another post. Experienced users know to be wary when proofs go through too easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to prove nonsense is getting your definitions wrong. With luck, the lemmas that you have to prove about your definitions will reveal any errors. Apart from that, you will be okay provided the definitions do not appear in the main theorem. Recently I completed a large proof where I was deeply unsure that I understood the subject matter. Fortunately, the headline result included none of the intricate definitions involved in the work. The key point is that making a definition in a proof assistant does not compromise its consistency. If the definition is wrong, theorems mentioning it will not mean what you think they mean, but you will not be able to prove $1=0$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the answer to those who complain that $x/0=0$ in Isabelle (also, in HOL and Lean): if your theorem does not mention1 the division symbol then it doesn’t matter. And if it does mention division, then the only possible discrepancy between Isabelle’s interpretation and the traditional one involves division by zero; in that case, there is no traditional interpretation to disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Soundness bugs in proof assistants&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect proof assistants to be correct, but how trustworthy are they really? I spent a little time tracking down soundness errors in a few of them: first, naturally, Isabelle, where there has been one error every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025 (last February), somebody showed how to prove false in Isabelle/HOL using normalisation by evaluation, which bypasses the proof kernel. This was not a kernel bug, and unlikely to bump into by accident, but it was obviously unacceptable and was fixed in the following Isabelle release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Ondřej Kunčar found a bug in Isabelle/HOL’s treatment of overloaded definitions. A particularly cunning circular definition was accepted and could be used to prove false. I recall arguing that this was not really a soundness bug. But just above, I have noted how important it is that definitions preserve consistency: in particular, that they can be eliminated (in principle) by substitution. Kunčar and Popescu put a great effort into not just fixing this bug but putting the definition mechanism onto a sound theoretical bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Obua discovered that essentially no checks were being performed on overloaded definitions. He discovered a not-quite-so cunning circular definition that could be used to prove false (details in the previous paper).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There must have been earlier soundness bugs in Isabelle, but I cannot remember any beyond those above. Definitions were not being checked for circularity because Isabelle was specialised research software and I couldn’t be bothered to stop people from hanging themselves: that old UNIX spirit. But good computer systems do protect users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early soundness bug in HOL88 also involved definitions. It was omitting to check that all the variables on the right hand side of the definition also appeared on the left-hand side. That leads to a contradiction trivially. A subtler error is to allow a definition where the right hand side is “more polymorphic” than the left and depends on some property of a type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can still remember a soundness bug that I introduced into LCF 40 years ago. I was coding 𝛼-conversion: a function to test whether two λ-expressions were equivalent up to renaming of bound variables. For example, $\lambda x.x$ and $\lambda y.y$ are 𝛼-equivalent. But I was coding in LISP and used a popular optimisation of testing for pointer equality, overlooking that it made no sense here. My code regarded $\lambda x.x$ and $\lambda y.x$ as equivalent. This sort of bug is particularly dangerous because it is in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never heard of any soundness bug in Rocq, but fortunately, the Rocq team maintain a convenient list of critical bugs. It’s scary, and you have to wonder what they did wrong. After all, Lean is based on a similar calculus and seems to have a good soundness record. Another seriously buggy proof assistant is PVS; at least, it was 30 years ago. PVS has no proof kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My impression is that the LCF style systems, including the HOL family as well as Isabelle, have an excellent record for soundness, confirming Robin Milner’s conception from half a century ago – and with no countervailing penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So can we rely on machine proofs?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the woeful tales related above, I am not aware of any that had practical implications. Even soundness bugs seem to have a limited impact. Griffioen and Huisman wrote of PVS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious question thus arises, why use a proof tool that probably contains soundness bugs? … PVS is still a very critical reader of proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close examination of almost any proof published in a mathematics journal will identify errors. Most are easy to fix, but the persistence of errors must undermine our confidence in published mathematics. Let’s recall once again that remarkable group of footnotes from The Axiom of Choice, by T J Jech:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exact list was used by DeMillo et al. as evidence for the strength of the mathematical community and decades later, in my own grant proposal, as evidence for its weakness. In the case of machine proofs, with the crucial caveat that abstract models of the real world often turn out to be inadequate, we do not find errors. Evidence from testing suggests that verification works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my corner of the world of interactive theorem proving, we take soundness seriously. Mike Gordon strongly promoted a definitional approach: no axioms ever, all proof developments built upon pure higher-logic from definitions alone, to avoid any danger of inconsistency. Many of the variants of the HOL system owe their existence to a desire for ever greater rigour. For example, John Harrison writes “HOL Light is distinguished by its clean and simple design and extremely small logical kernel.” The HOL light kernel was later verified. The apotheosis of this project is the Candle theorem prover, created by porting HOL Light to the CakeML language. Candle has been proved to correctly implement higher-order logic, and moreover, this theorem has been established for its compiled machine code. We have no way of knowing whether higher-order logic is consistent, but if it isn’t, there will be nothing left of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, higher-order logic is remarkably self-contained. Over past decades, the HOL provers and Isabelle/HOL have gained numerous extensions: recursive datatypes, general recursive function definitions with pattern matching, inductive definitions and coinductive definitions. These are all definable within higher order logic, whereas similar capabilities in dependent type theories always seem to require extensions to the kernel. And that means, any bugs are kernel bugs. In view of the much greater logical strength of dependent type theories, this situation is hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;directly or indirectly (see the first comment below) ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Speculative Sampling Explained&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Speculative Sampling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of speculative sampling is to use a draft sampling to achieve the same sampling result as the target sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a target sampling distribution $p(x)$ and a draft sampling distribution $q(x)$. For each token $x_i$, we have two probabilities: $p(x_i)$ and $q(x_i)$, and we have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;either $p(x_i) &amp;gt; q(x_i)$,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;or $p(x_i) \leq q(x_i)$,&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we directly sample from $q(x)$, we will get a sample $x$ that is not from the target distribution $p(x)$, and it is&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;over-sampled if $q(x_i) &amp;gt; p(x_i)$,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;under-sampled if $q(x_i) &amp;lt; p(x_i)$.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core trick of speculative sampling is to design a smart rejection method to down-sample the over-sampled tokens and up-sample the under-sampled tokens. This way we can achieve the same sampling result as the target sampling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to down-sample the over-sampled tokens?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to use a rejection method to reject the over-sampled probability. We only accept the sample with a probability of $p(x_i) / q(x_i)$. As our assumption was over-sampled, we have $p(x_i) &amp;lt; q(x_i)$, and the acceptance probability is less than 1. (This is also why they have $\min(1, p(x_i) / q(x_i))$ in the paper. The 1 is to deal with the case where $p(x_i) &amp;gt; q(x_i)$, which is not over-sampled.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to up-sample the under-sampled tokens?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to give the under-sampled probability an additional chance to be sampled. First, we do not reject the under-sampled probability. Second, when an rejection is triggered from the over-sampled probability, we re-sample from the under-sampled probability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we first define a new distribution which represents the under-sampled probability. We call it the residual distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The residual distribution is defined as follows: $ r(x_i) = \frac{\max(0, p(x_i) - q(x_i))}{\sum_{x_i} \max(0, p(x_i) - q(x_i))} $&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The residual distribution is a probability distribution, and it is a distribution over the under-sampled tokens. All over-sampled tokens have zero probability in the residual distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we reject a sample from the over-sampled probability, we re-sample from the residual distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does this recover the target distribution?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuitively, the answer is yes. Rigorously, you can check out the proof of Theorem 1 in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core step is to compute the total rejection probability which will trigger a re-sampling from the residual distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is $1 - \sum_{x_i} \min(p(x_i), q(x_i)) = \sum_{x_i} \max(0, p(x_i) - q(x_i))$. Magic! This is exactly the normalization constant of the residual distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the final sampling result is $min(p(x_i), q(x_i)) + \max(0, p(x_i) - q(x_i)) = p(x_i)$.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key concepts of speculative sampling are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;over-sampled and under-sampled tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;down-sample the over-sampled tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;up-sample the under-sampled tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;residual distribution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;total rejection probability to trigger a re-sampling from the residual distribution&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;recovery of the target distribution&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A debilitating infection from the parasitic Guinea worm is inching closer to global eradication, with an all-time low of only 10 human cases reported worldwide in 2025, the Carter Center announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If health workers can fully wipe out the worms, it will be only the second human disease to be eradicated, after smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis) is a parasitic nematode transmitted in water. More specifically, it’s found in waters that contain small crustacean copepods, which harbor the worm’s larvae. If a person consumes water contaminated with Guinea worm, the parasites burrow through the intestinal tract and migrate through the body. About a year later, a spaghetti noodle-length worm emerges from a painful blister, usually in the feet or legs. It can take up to eight weeks for the adult worm to fully emerge. To ease the searing pain, infected people may put their blistered limbs in water, allowing the parasite to release more larvae and continue the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to being extremely painful, the disease (dracunculiasis) can lead to complications, such as secondary infections and sepsis, which in turn can lead to temporary or permanent disability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Guinea worm eradication program began in 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases across 21 countries in Africa and Asia. To date, only six countries have not been certified by the World Health Organization as Guinea worm-free. In 2024, there were just 15 cases, and, according to the provisional tally for 2025, the number is down to just 10. It’s considered provisional until each country’s disease reports are confirmed, which occurs in a program meeting usually held in April.&lt;/p&gt;
