    &lt;p&gt;Robots designed for the era of AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission is to free humans from physical labor with robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We imagine a future where robots handle the essential, repetitive work and humans are free to create, connect, and pursue what truly matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build that future we’re starting from the ground up with hardware. Our first product is a California-designed and assembled humanoid arm. Surrounding it, we’re developing advanced controls, intuitive data collection, and a full AI stack that makes deployment effortless in real industrial environments. We’re proving it on our own assembly line first.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Tried Gleam for Advent of Code, and I Get the Hype&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do Advent of Code every year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last seven years, including this one, I have managed to get all the stars. I do not say that to brag. I say it because it explains why I keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is one of the few tech traditions I never get bored of, even after doing it for a long time. I like the time pressure. I like the community vibe. I like that every December I can pick one language and go all in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, I picked Gleam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A much shorter year#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is usually 25 days. This year Eric decided to do 12 days instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So instead of 50 parts, it was 24.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sounds like a relaxed year. It was not, but not in a bad way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easier days were harder than the easy days in past years, but they were also really engaging and fun to work through. The hard days were hard, especially the last three, but they were still the good kind of hard. They were problems I actually wanted to wrestle with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also changes the pacing in a funny way. In a normal year, by day 10 you have a pretty comfy toolbox. This year it felt like the puzzles were already demanding that toolbox while I was still building it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That turned out to be a perfect setup for learning a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Gleam felt like a good AoC language#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gleam is easy to like quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The syntax is clean. The compiler is helpful, and the error messages are super duper good. Rust good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the language strongly nudges you into a style that fits Advent of Code really well. Parse some text. Transform it a few times. Fold. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, pipes. Pipes everywhere. I love pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I did not expect was how good the editor experience would be. The LSP worked much better than I expected. It basically worked perfectly the whole time. I used the Gleam extension for IntelliJ and it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25254-gleam-language&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also just like FP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FP is not always easier, but it is often easier. When it clicks, you stop writing instructions and you start describing the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first Gleam superpower: &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I fell in love with was &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is basically a print statement that does not make you earn it. You can &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; any value. You do not have to format anything. You do not have to build a string. You can just drop it into a pipeline and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;list.range(0, 5)
|&amp;gt; echo
|&amp;gt; list.map(int.to_string)
|&amp;gt; echo
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can quickly inspect values at multiple points without breaking the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did miss string interpolation, especially early on. &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; made up for a lot of that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It mostly hit when I needed to generate text, not when I needed to inspect values. The day where I generated an LP file for &lt;code&gt;glpsol&lt;/code&gt; is the best example. It is not hard code, but it is a lot of string building. Without interpolation it turns into a bit of a mess of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a small excerpt from my LP generator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Minimize\n"
&amp;lt;&amp;gt; "  total: "
&amp;lt;&amp;gt; buttons
|&amp;gt; string.join(" + ")
&amp;lt;&amp;gt; "\n\nSubject To\n"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works. It is just the kind of code where you really feel missing interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Options everywhere, and why that matters for grid puzzles#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of AoC is grids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grids are where you normally either crash into out of bounds bugs, or you litter your code with bounds checks you do not care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my day 4 solution I used a dict as a grid. The key ergonomic part is that &lt;code&gt;dict.get&lt;/code&gt; gives you an option-like result, which makes neighbour checking safe by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the neighbour function from my solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fn get_neighbours(grid: Grid(Object), pos: Position) -&amp;gt; List(Object) {
  [
    #(pos.0 - 1, pos.1 - 1),
    #(pos.0 - 1, pos.1),
    #(pos.0 - 1, pos.1 + 1),
    #(pos.0, pos.1 - 1),
    #(pos.0, pos.1 + 1),
    #(pos.0 + 1, pos.1 - 1),
    #(pos.0 + 1, pos.1),
    #(pos.0 + 1, pos.1 + 1),
  ]
  |&amp;gt; list.filter_map(fn(neighbour_pos) { grid |&amp;gt; dict.get(neighbour_pos) })
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That last line is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No bounds checks. No sentinel values. Out of bounds just disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The list toolbox is genuinely good#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected to write parsers and helpers, and I did. What I did not expect was how often Gleam already had the exact list function I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.transpose&lt;/code&gt; saved a whole day#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 6 part 1 was basically a transpose problem in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read the input, chunked it into rows, transposed it, and suddenly the rest of the puzzle became obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;input
|&amp;gt; list.transpose
|&amp;gt; list.map(fn(line) { line |&amp;gt; calculate_instruction })
|&amp;gt; bigi.sum
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a lot of languages you end up writing your own transpose yet again. In Gleam it is already there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.combination_pairs&lt;/code&gt; is a cheat code#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example is &lt;code&gt;list.combination_pairs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In day 8 I needed all pairs of 3D points. In an imperative language you would probably write nested loops and then question your off by one logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Gleam it is a one liner:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;boxes
|&amp;gt; list.combination_pairs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes FP is not about being clever. It is about having the right function name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt; is my favorite thing I found#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I had to pick one feature that made me want to keep writing Gleam after AoC, it is &lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early exit without hacks is fantastic in puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In day 8 part 2 I kept merging sets until the first set in the list contained all boxes. When that happens, I stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core shape looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;|&amp;gt; list.fold_until(initial, fn(acc, pair) {
  case done_yet {
    True -&amp;gt; Stop(new_acc)
    False -&amp;gt; Continue(new_acc)
  }
})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is small, explicit, and it reads like intent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also used &lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt; in day 10 part 1 to find the smallest combination size that works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where Gleam fought me a bit#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I enjoyed Gleam a lot, I did hit a few recurring friction points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these are deal breakers. They are just the kind of things you notice when you do 24 parts in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;File IO is not in the standard library#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one surprised me on day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For AoC you read a file every day. In this repo I used &lt;code&gt;simplifile&lt;/code&gt; everywhere because you need something. It is fine, I just did not expect basic file IO to be outside the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Regex is a dependency too#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 2 part 2 pushed me into regex and I had to add &lt;code&gt;gleam_regexp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the style I used, building a regex from a substring:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let assert Ok(re) = regexp.from_string("^(" &amp;lt;&amp;gt; substring &amp;lt;&amp;gt; ")+$")
regexp.check(re, val)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, totally fine. It just surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;List pattern matching limitations#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;code&gt;[first, ..rest]&lt;/code&gt; and you can do &lt;code&gt;[first, second]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you cannot do &lt;code&gt;[first, ..middle, last]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not the end of the world, but it would have made some parsing cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Comparisons are explicit#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Gleam a lot of comparisons are not booleans. You get an &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great for sorting. It is also very explicit. It can be a bit verbose when you just want an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt; check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In day 5 I ended up writing patterns like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;case cmp_start, cmp_end {
  order.Lt, _ -&amp;gt; False
  _, order.Gt -&amp;gt; False
  _, _ -&amp;gt; True
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big integers, and targeting JavaScript#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;bigi&lt;/code&gt; a few times this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Erlang VM, integers are arbitrary precision, so you usually do not care about overflow. That is one of the nicest things about the BEAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want your Gleam code to also target JavaScript, you do care. JavaScript has limits, and suddenly using &lt;code&gt;bigi&lt;/code&gt; becomes necessary for some puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish that was just part of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, with a single consistent story across targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The most satisfying part: XOR as bitmasks#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 10 part 1 was my favorite part of the whole event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moment I saw the toggling behavior, it clicked as XOR. Represent the lights as a number. Represent each button as a bitmask. Find the smallest combination of bitmasks that XOR to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the fold from my solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;combination
|&amp;gt; list.fold(0, fn(acc, comb) {
  int.bitwise_exclusive_or(acc, comb)
})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It felt clean, it felt fast, and it felt like the representation did most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The least satisfying part: shelling out to &lt;code&gt;glpsol&lt;/code&gt;#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 10 part 2 was the opposite feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew brute force was out. It was clearly a system of linear equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous years I would reach for Z3, but there are no Z3 bindings for Gleam. I tried to stay in Gleam, and I ended up generating an LP file and shelling out to &lt;code&gt;glpsol&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;shellout&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It worked, and honestly the LP format is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let _ =
  shellout.command(
    "glpsol",
    ["--lp", "temp.lp", "-w", "temp_sol.txt"],
    ".",
    [],
  )
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a hack, but it is a pragmatic hack, and that is also part of Advent of Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memoization keys that actually model the problem#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 11 part 2 is where I was happy I was writing Gleam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important detail was that the memo key is not just the node. It is the node plus your state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case the key was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#(neighbour, new_seen_dac, new_seen_fft)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I got the memo threading right, it ran instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The finale, and the troll heuristic#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last day was the only puzzle I did not fully enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not because it was bad. It just felt like it relied on assumptions about the input, and I am one of those people that does not love doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I overthought it for a bit, then I learned it was more of a troll problem. The “do the areas of the pieces, when fully interlocked, fit on the board” heuristic was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my solution it is literally this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;heuristic_area &amp;lt;= max_area
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you build a beautiful mental model and then the right answer is a single inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing thoughts#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am very happy I picked Gleam this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has sharp edges, mostly around where the standard library draws the line and a few language constraints that show up in puzzle code. But it also has real strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pipelines feel good. Options and Results make unsafe problems feel safe. The list toolbox is better than I expected. &lt;code&gt;fold_until&lt;/code&gt; is incredible. Once you stop trying to write loops and you let it be functional, the solutions start to feel clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cannot wait to try Gleam in a real project. I have been thinking about using it to write a webserver, and I am genuinely excited to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, I cannot wait for next year’s Advent of Code.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In a large-scale analysis of 20 popular VPNs, IPinfo found that 17 of those VPNs exit traffic from different countries than they claim. Some claim 100+ countries, but many of them point to the same handful of physical data centers in the US or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means the majority of VPN providers we analyzed don’t route your traffic via the countries they claim to, and they claim many more countries than they actually support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing over 150,000 exit IPs across 137 possible exit countries, and comparing what providers claim to what IPinfo measures, shows that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This report walks through what we saw across VPN and IP data providers, provides a closer look at two particularly interesting countries, explores why measurement-based IP data matters if you care where your traffic really goes, and shares how we ran the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the overlap between the number of listed countries each VPN provider claims to offer versus the countries with real VPN traffic that we measured — lower percentages indicate providers whose claimed lists best match our data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that we used the most commonly and widely supported technologies in this research, to make comparison between providers as fair as possible while giving us significant data to analyze, so this will not be the full coverage for each provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are some of the most visible names in the market. They also tend to have very long country lists on their websites. Notably, three well-known providers had zero mismatches across all the countries we tested: Mullvad, IVPN, and Windscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Country mismatches doesn’t automatically mean some providers offer “bad VPNs,” but it does mean that if you’re choosing a VPN because it claims “100+ countries,” you should know that a significant share of those flags may be labels, or virtual locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a VPN lets you connect to, for example, “Bahamas” or “Somalia,” that doesn’t always mean traffic routes through there. In many cases, it’s somewhere entirely different, like Miami or London, but presented as if traffic is in the country you picked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup is known as a virtual location:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? Without active network measurement, most IP datasets will rely on what the IP’s owner told the internet registry or published in WHOIS/geofeeds: a self-reported country tag. If that record is wrong or outdated, the mistake spreads everywhere. That’s where IPinfo’s ProbeNet comes in: by running live RTT tests from 1,200+ points of presence worldwide, we anchor each IP to its real-world location, not just its declared one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the dataset, we found 97 countries where at least one VPN brand only ever appeared as virtual or unmeasurable in our data. In other words, for a noticeable slice of the world map, some “locations” in VPNs never show up as true exits in our measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also found 38 countries where every mention behaved this way: at least one VPN claimed them, but none ever produced a stable, measurable exit in that country in our sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of these 38 as the “unmeasurable” countries in this study – places that exist in server lists, config files, and IP geofeeds, but never once appeared as the actual exit country in our measurements. They’re not randomly scattered – they cluster in specific parts of the map. By region, that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prove there is zero VPN infrastructure in those countries globally. It does show that, across the providers and locations we measured, the dominant pattern is to serve those locations from elsewhere. Here are three of the most interesting examples of how this looks at the IP level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this concrete, let’s look at three countries where every provider in our dataset turned out to be virtual: Bahamas, and Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our measurements, five providers offered locations labeled as “Bahamas”: NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access, FastVPN, and IPVanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all of them, measured traffic was in the United States, usually with sub-millisecond RTT to US probes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somalia appears in our sample for only two providers: NordVPN and ProtonVPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both label Mogadishu explicitly in their naming, but these RTTs are exactly what you’d expect for traffic in Western Europe, and completely inconsistent with traffic in East Africa. Both providers go out of their way in the labels (e.g. “SO, Mogadishu”), but the actual traffic is in Nice and London, not Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve talked about VPN claims versus our measurements. But other IP data providers don’t run active RTT tests. They rely on self-declared IP data sources, and often assume that if an IP is tagged as “Country X,” it must actually be there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these cases, the IP legacy datasets typically “follow” the VPN provider’s story: if the VPN markets the endpoint as Country X, the legacy IP dataset also places it in Country X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify that, we looked at 736 VPN exits where ProbeNet’s measured country disagreed with one or more widely used legacy IP datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then compared the country IPinfo's ProbeNet measured (backed by RTT and routing) with the country reported by these other IP datasets and computed the distance between them. The gaps are large:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The median error between ProbeNet and the legacy datasets was roughly 3,100 km. On the ProbeNet side, we have strong latency evidence that our measured country is the right one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what you expect when traffic is genuinely in that country, not thousands of kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This behavior is much more tangible if you can see it on a single IP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's one VPN exit IP where ProbeNet places the server in the United Kingdom, backed by sub-millisecond RTT from local probes, while other widely used legacy IP datasets place the same IP in Mauritius, 9,691 kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🇬🇧 United Kingdom vs 🇲🇺 Mauritius (ProtonVPN)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to check this yourself, you can plug it into a public measurement tool like https://ping.sx/ and run pings or traceroutes from different regions. Tools like this one provide a clear visual for where latency is lowest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ProbeNet uses the same basic idea, but at a different scale: we maintain a network of 1,200+ points of presence (PoPs) around the world, so we can usually get even closer to the real physical location than public tools with smaller networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to play with more real IPs (not necessarily VPNs) where ProbeNet and IPinfo get the country right and other datasets don’t, you can find a fuller set of examples on our IP geolocation accuracy page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s worth separating technical reasons from trust issues. There are technical reasons to use virtual or hubbed infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this perspective, a virtual location can be a reasonable compromise: you get a regional IP and content unblocking without the downsides of hosting in a fragile environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three things change the picture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That last point leads directly into the IP data problem that we are focused on solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a VPN user, here are some practical takeaways from this work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this isn’t an argument against VPNs, or even against virtual locations. It’s an argument for honesty and evidence. If a VPN provider wants you to trust that map of flags, they should be willing, and able, to show that it matches the real network underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most legacy IP data providers rely on regional internet registry (RIR) allocation data and heuristics around routing and address blocks. These providers will often accept self-declared data like customer feedback, corrections, and geofeeds, without a clear way to verify them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IPinfo takes a measurement-first approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This measurement-first approach is unique in the IP data space. Once we realized how much inaccuracy came from self-declared data, we started investing heavily in research and building ProbeNet to use active measurements at scale. Our goal is to make IP data as evidence-based as possible, verifying with observation on how the internet actually behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We approached this VPN investigation the way a skeptical but well-equipped user would: start from the VPNs’ own claims, then test them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each of the 20 VPN providers, we pulled together three kinds of data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we used IPinfo infrastructure and ProbeNet to dial into those locations and watch what actually happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we had two views for each location:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each location where a country was clearly specified, we asked a very simple question: Does the expected country match the measured country?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If yes, we counted it as a match. If not, it became a mismatch: a location where the app says one country, but the traffic exits somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We deliberately used a very narrow definition of “mismatch.” For a location to be counted, two things had to be true: the provider had to clearly claim a specific country (on their website, in their app, or in configs), and we had direct active measurements from ProbeNet for the exit IPs behind that location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ignored any locations where the marketing was ambiguous, where we hadn’t measured the exit directly, or where we only had weaker hints like hostname strings, registry data, or third-party IP databases. Those signals can be useful and true, but we wanted our numbers to be as hard-to-argue-with as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is that the mismatch rates we show here are conservative. With a looser methodology that also leaned on those additional hints, the numbers would almost certainly be higher, not lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ben founded IPinfo in 2013 with the goal of providing reliable, easily accessible IP address data. As IPinfo co-CEO, he is committed to constantly improving that data and how customers can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author’s note: I originally intended for this post to cover adventure games, computer role-playing games, wargames and other simulations, a brief look at the home video game market, and finally the rise of hybrids that fused home video game systems with personal computers. In the grand scheme of the story about personal computers that I am trying to tell, it probably does not make sense to lavish nearly 7,000 words on early adventure games alone, but it’s a topic of personal interest to me and the tale grew in the telling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Play was central to the formation of personal computer culture. For the early hobbyists who were fascinated by the guts of the machine, the computer was a plaything in and of itself. Many of those who joined the hobby in 1975 or 1976 did so because of games: they had experience with the extensive BASIC game culture that circulated in the time-sharing systems of universities, high schools, and even corporations, and wanted to keep playing at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after the rise of commercial personal computer software, when the first truly useful applications began appearing, games remained by far the most popular software category (counting by number of titles produced and number of units sold, although not by dollar value). One 1980 catalog of Apple II software, for example, lists 265 titles, of which roughly two-thirds are games, from Ack-Ack (an anti-aircraft target shooter)to Wipe Off (a Breakout clone). The rest of the catalog comprises demos, educational programs, and a smattering of business software. Whatever they might say about the practical value of the personal computer, buyers had an evident hunger for games.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Early Games and Their Market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer owners got their hands on games in one of three ways. In the early years, the most common means would be simply copying a paper or cassette tape from a friend or colleague, whether with the permission of the original author or not. In the early years, most hobbyists treated game software as a commons to be freely shared, just as it had been in the time-sharing culture through cooperatives like DECUS. This peer-to-peer copying would never entirely go away, despite the commercialization of game software and various schemes by publishers to try to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many magazines and books also published “type-ins,” complete computer programs (almost always written in BASIC) intended to be manually entered at the keyboard (and then saved to tape or disk), and these, too, were most often games. Dave Ahl’s BASIC Computer Games (first published in 1973 by Digital Equipment Corporation), a collection of over 100 type-ins, reputedly sold one million copies by 1979. Though type-in publication continued through the 1980s, the inherent limits on the length of such programs (only the most dedicated would tackle a type-in that was more than a few hundred lines long) and their reliance on the universality of BASIC (rather than more performant compiled languages) meant that their significance waned as the sophistication of the game market increased. They could serve as fun demos or educational tools for learning to code, but could not compare to similar games available commercially.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, of course, there were the commercial titles offered by software publishers. The game business began in the same way as the personal computer hardware business: with hobby-entrepreneurs selling their creations to fellow hobbyists. In July 1976, for example, D.E. Hipps of Miami, Florida offered a Star Trek game written for MicroSoft’s Altair BASIC for $10 (no one at this stage of the industry paid any attention to niceties such as licensing agreements for the use of the Star Trek name). No common standard data storage standard existed; hobbyists employed a mix of paper teletype tapes, cassette storage, and (for the most extravagant) floppy disks. So Hipps opted to distribute his game as printed source code: a type-in! SCELBI (creators of one of the early, pre-Altair hobby computers), offered another Star Trek variant called Galaxy in the same form. By the late 1970s, the convergence of the industry on a small number of popular storage standards (with CP/M dominant) resolved this problem, and most games were distributed in plastic baggies containing instructions and a cassette or floppy disk.[3]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for other entrepreneurs to see a business opportunity in making it easier for software authors to publish their games. It took some time for clear business models and market verticals to emerge. No categorial distinction existed between publishers of games and publishers of utility and business software prior to 1980: Personal Software’s first big hit was MicroChess, followed by VisiCalc, followed by (as we’ll soon see) Zork. Programma International’s founder began as a hoarder of Apple II software, much of it acquired from copies unauthorized by the original author, then turned legitimate to sell those authors’ software instead. Softape tried selling bundles of software by subscription, and then started its own newsletter for subscribers, Softalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some magazines went the other way around: Softside magazine (located the next town over from BYTE’s Peterborough, New Hampshire headquarters) created The Software Exchange (TSE), while Dave Ahl’s Creative Computing set up a label called Sensational Software. Type-ins printed in the magazines became a gateway drug to more convenient (and often more complex and interesting) software available for sale on cassette or diskette.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 21: Creative Computing heavily advertised the Sensational Software brand in the pages of the magazine, as in this July 1980 example describing some of their most popular hits and offering a free catalog of their full offering of 400 titles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early personal computer game culture imitated what came before it. The boundary between mini- and microcomputer culture was permeated by thousands who used time-sharing systems at work or school and then went home to a hobby computer. Prior to 1977, a game written for a personal computer was almost invariably based on a game drawn from the other side of that boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barring a few exceptions (such as the PLATO system available at some universities), users interacted with such computer systems through teletypes or video teletypes that alternated sending and receiving text. So, the resulting games were turn-based, purely textual, and relied on strategy and calculation (or pure luck) to win, not timing and reaction speed. These textual games suited the early hobbyists perfectly, since almost all of their computers also had text-only interfaces, whether mechanical teletypes or video displays like the TV Typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than simple quizzes, demos, and guessing games, popular titles included simulations such as Hammurabi, Civil War and Lunar Lander; statistical recreations of sports contests (baseball, basketball, golf, etc.); or classic games or puzzles from the physical world, like checkers, Yahtzee, and the towers of Hanoi. By far the most popular by far, however, judging by the number of variations published and references in hobby magazines, were descendants of Mike Mayfield’s 1971 Star Trek, a strategic game of galactic war against the Klingons.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 22:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some early personal computers, however, had video controllers with built-in memory, which allowed for more sophisticated interfaces than the simple back-and-forth exchanges of a teletype. Processor Technology, whose VDM-1 display interface could paint characters at arbitrary points on the screen, sold real-time textual games by Steve Dompier like Trek-80 (released in 1976, despite the name). Its interface (including a galactic sector map made of text characters and readouts of the Enterprise’s weapon and shield status) updated in real-time in response to player and (simulated) enemy actions, rather than scrolling by one turn at a time. Cromemco, maker of the Dazzler, an Altair-compatible graphics board, offered the only personal computer games to use pixel graphics prior to the Apple II, starting with a version of the seminal Spacewar in early 1977. They followed with a suite of similar games such as Tankwar and Dogfight.[6]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 1977, when computers with graphical displays became more widely available (especially the full-color Apple II), computer games tapped a new vein of inspiration (and imitation): arcade games. Originally commercialized by Atari and its imitators as standalone arcade cabinets in the early 1970s, then moving into homes by the mid-1970s, these games were typically real-time and focused on action. Relatively cheap and easy-to-make, and relatively disposable to the user (few took more than a few minutes to play a complete game), computer action games proliferated by the hundreds and thousands, many of them direct or near clones of pre-existing arcade or home video games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1980, however, there were major innovations that set personal computer games apart from other game media. In-depth simulations, expansive adventures that took hours to solve, and dungeon crawls teeming with a variety of monsters, treasures, and traps provided immersive experiences that the action-oriented video game consoles, did not, and (given their limited memory and storage capacity) could not provide. Once combined with full-color, bitmapped graphics, these games also surpassed anything previously available on their time-sharing predecessors. The era of imitation was definitively over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Adventure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For several years of my childhood, for reasons that I no longer recall, our family’s Apple IIe computer, equipped with a green-and-black monochrome monitor, resided in my bedroom. Though much of my autobiographical memory is quite hazy, I can clearly remember each of the Apple II games we owned, stored on 5 ¼-inch-square floppy disks: Syzygy (a space shooter in the vein of Asteroids), One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird, Winter Games, and Arcticfox (a sci-fi tank simulator with wireframe graphics).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the game that truly captured my imagination, the game whose opening sequence and imagery remain etched (monochromatically) in my mind, was King’s Quest II: Romancing the Throne, a 1985 title by Sierra On-Line. The forty-nine-screen, hand-drawn fairy tale kingdom that you explore in the game (via your avatar, King Graham) felt like a vast world of endless possibility compared to the cramped half-court of One on One, the endlessly repeating monotony of a biathlon course in Winter Games, or the sterile polygonal landscape of Arcticfox’s Antarctica. That open-ended feeling was enhanced by the lure of hidden secrets just out of reach, and a freeform text interface that accepted English commands like “THROW APPLE” (though only a tiny subset of the commands you could imagine would actually work). Despite its limitations and many, many frustrations (at age seven or eight, with no hint book and no Internet walkthroughs, I certainly never came close to completing it), it made me feel that I was truly experiencing an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The adventure game genre originated in a freely shared, text-driven game created in the time-sharing world. The game, which I will call Adventure (it is variously called Colossal Cave Adventure, Colossal Cave, Adventure, or simply ADVENT, after the game’s PDP-10 file name)challenged players to find five treasures within a cave complex by navigating a maze, solving puzzles, and defeating a band of axe-wielding dwarves Its author was Will Crowther, a programmer at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), where he had written core infrastructural software for ARPANET, the first nationwide computer network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1975, Crowther went through a painful divorce. He had always enjoyed playing games with his school age daughters, so he began crafting a game on the company’s DEC PDP-10 to help him stay connected with them. Crowther copied the physical structure of Adventure’s cave directly from a portion of the Mammoth complex in Kentucky. (He had met his wife through caving, and they had explored Mammoth together, so the game was also, in a sense, a means of staying connected to his former, married life.) It is probable (though not certain) that Crowther also drew some inspiration from a popular 1973 time-sharing game called Hunt the Wumpus, which required users to use textual clues to find and kill a Wumpus hidden in a system of caves without falling into a pit. But the conceptual structure of Adventure (delving into the earth to find treasure and magical artifacts in the face of devious obstacles and armed foes) came from a new game of pencil, paper, and imagination that Crowther was playing with some of his BBN friends, called Dungeons and Dragons.[7]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Crowther’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…the caving had stopped, because that had become awkward, so I decided I would fool around and write a program that was a re-creation in fantasy of my caving, and also would be a game for the kids, and perhaps had some aspects of the Dungeons and Dragons that I had been playing.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as in the later King’s Quest II, the player used simple verb-noun commands (such as “TAKE LAMP”) to interact with the world, but lacking a graphical screen with a visible avatar, he or she also used text commands to move about the world, from one room of the cave to the next (e.g., “SOUTH” or “EAST”). Crowther showed the game off to his D&amp;amp;D buddies and his daughters, then took a new job in California, and forgot about it.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time-sharing games had once propagated gradually from computer to computer via collectives like the Digital Equipment Computer Users’ Society or colleagues and friends mailing paper tapes to one another. But BBN was on the ARPANET, and Crowther had put his game on a public directory in the BBN computer. From there, someone copied it across the network to a computer in a Stanford lab, where a graduate student, Don Woods, found it in early 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fascinated by Crowther’s game, Woods contacted him for the FORTRAN source code, and set about expanding it. He increased the scope by adding more rooms, more puzzles, more foes, and more ways to interact with the world; but he also added the ability to save your progress and a point-tracking system with a final objective: to find fifteen treasures and return them to the starting location. Woods’ larger, more polished version of Adventure spread rapidly across the time-sharing world, and became an obsession for some, keeping them at the office past midnight in search of that last treasure. (One of Woods’ additions was a setting to allow admins to disable the game during working hours.)[10]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Adventureland&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A frizzy-haired Florida man, Scott Adams, was the first to commercialize a version of Adventure for the personal computer. He had first fallen in love with computers on a time-sharing terminal at his Miami high school in the late 1960s. He went on to earn a computer science degree and by the late 1970s, was working as a programmer at telecom manufacturer Stromberg-Carlson. On the side he had become an avid home computer hobbyist, purchasing a Sphere computer in 1975 and then a TRS-80 in 1977. Shortly thereafter he discovered Adventure on the company time-sharing system and, like many before and after, could not quit playing until he had beaten it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adams decided that it would be an interesting challenge to build something similar for the TRS-80. It would have to be much smaller to fit in the sixteen kilobytes of memory he had available. The Crowther-Woods Adventure contained 140 distinct locations and ran to eighty kilobytes of (uncompiled) FORTRAN and fifty-four kilobytes of data for the game text. Adams’ Adventureland was considerably smaller, with fewer than thirty-five locations—not necessarily to the detriment of gameplay; for example, the cutting lopped off most of Adventure’s huge and torturous mazes.[11]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adams’ local TRS-80 buddies were impressed enough with his game that he decided to sell it through both The TRS-80 Software Exchange and Creative Computing, who offered it on cassette for $24.95 and $14.95, respectively, in their January 1979 magazine issues. He followed up with a whole series of games, starting with Pirate Adventure, and ported the games from the TRS-80 to other popular computer platforms. His wife Alexis joined the venture as a business manager and game designer, co-authoring Mystery Fun House and Voodoo Castle.[12]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The adventure game genre is often criticized for absurd and unfair puzzles, which can be guessed at only through trial-and-error, and tedious mazes or other navigational obfuscations. These early games from circa 1980 are among the worst offenders. In Adventureland, for example, a “very thin” black bear blocks your way, and the only way to get past it is to “yell” at it. Feeding this apparently hungry bear honey will prevent you from completing the game, because the honey is one of the treasures you must collect. You could easily get to state in these games where you have lost the game without knowing it.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But these criticisms are retrospective: the contemporary press and the buying public lapped up the Adams’ adventures and all of their imitators. We have to remember that the appeal of this genre lay in getting immersed (one might say “lost”) in the game for hours every evening, clawing your way forward towards ultimate triumph for weeks, or even months, on end. In a market full of arcade-like games that offered the convenient but shallow fun of a bag of potato chips, adventure games provided a rich and fulfilling meal for the imagination. As one lover of the genre put it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adventure is the product of imagination appealing to imagination. It is not just the puzzle, or the theme, or the nonplayer characters and their personalities. It is a verbal tapestry of interwoven phrases that whisk you away to magical kingdoms of the mind. The computer becomes a tool of reaching that conveys you where it will. You go along eagerly, breathlessly, awaiting what comes next.[14]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The catch was that this delicacy was consumable only once: a solved adventure game was no more interesting to revisit than a solved crossword puzzle. So, they had to provide a challenge: no one wanted to pay $24.95 for a game on the way home from work and then breeze through it before bedtime. A game that was very fair would also risk being seen as a waste of money. Despite improvements in design in future years that would banish some of the worst practices of the genre, adventure games remained trapped on the horns of this dilemma.[15]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Zork&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Adams’ “Adventure” line made them wealthy enough to build a faux-castle outside Orlando, and kicked off one of the most popular computer game genres of the 1980s. By late 1980, half-a-dozen other companies were putting out personal computer adventure games, from The Programmer’s Guild to Mad Hatter Software, as well as a version of Crowther-Woods Adventure put out by Microsoft. But they are overshadowed in the historical record by a competitor that subsequently dominated both sales of and critical attention to text adventure games. It began at MIT. In the spring of 1977, the Crowther-Woods Adventure arrived over the ARPANET at the PDP-10 at the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS), and sank its claws into its employees. Impressed by what Crowther and Woods had done, but convinced that it could be made even better, a group of LCS staff set out in May 1977 to one-up Adventure.[16]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dave Lebling, who had already worked on several games (including Maze, the first first-person shooter game), kicked off the project. Lebling played Dungeons and Dragons in the same Cambridge D&amp;amp;D group as Crowther had (though not at the same time), and based the game’s combat system on the tabletop game. Then Marc Blank, Tim Anderson, and Bruce Daniels filled in most of the core structure of the program. They gave it the place-holder name of Zork (a term used as an inside-joke expletive at LCS, as in “why won’t this zorking thing work”), which ended up sticking permanently. The game reached its completed state in early 1979, by which point it greatly exceeded the original Adventure in scale, with 191 rooms and 211 items, occupying a full megabyte of memory.[17]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coded in a LISP-descendant called MUDDLE or MDL, Zork had an elegant design that encapsulated all the information about the possible interactions of each room and item in a single block of code and data, making it much easier to extend than Adventure. It also had a much richer text interface: both Adventure and AdventureLand accepted only “verb noun” commands, but Zork also allowed for conjunctions and prepositions (for example, “TAKE SWORD AND LANTERN FROM SACK”).Though aping the basic tropes of Adventure (a small overland area leading to an underground treasure-hunt), its more complex architecture allowed for a richer and more clever set of puzzles.[18]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1979, several key staff members of LCS were poised to leave MIT. Their supervisor, Al Vezza, proposed to keep the band together by forming a company. Incorporated in June as Infocom, its new employees and shareholders included Lebling, Blank, and Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the various partners mulled what exactly to do with their new business, Blank and a fellow LCS alum, Joel Berez, figured out how to cram Zork onto a microcomputer: they cut the number of rooms and items in the game in half and removed all the features of MDL not needed for the game, creating an interpreter for a simpler language they called Zork Implementation Language (ZIL). The resulting program occupied just seventy-seven kilobytes. To get this to fit into a microcomputer memory half that size, they had one last trick: a virtual memory system built into the interpreter, to swap chunks of the program on and off the disk as needed (typical floppy disk capacities at the time were over 100 kilobytes, and continued to grow). This meant that Zork could only run off of a floppy drive (whose rapidly spinning disk could sync to a new data location in a fraction of a second and supply data at fifteen kilobytes per second), never a cassette (which took a minute or more to fully unwind or rewind and supplied data at 300 bits per second). Or, to put it another way, the growing market prevalence of affordable floppy drives made larger personal computer adventure games feasible: it took about twenty minutes to load a Scott Adams adventure game from tape.[19]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 1979, Blank and Berez convinced a reluctant Vezza (who wanted to get into business software) to make a microcomputer Zork Infocom’s first product. They initially published through Personal Software, co-owned by MIT’s own Dan Fylstra, which had just recently released VisiCalc. But after VisiCalc’s smash success, Fylstra no longer wanted to deal in mere games, so Infocom became its own publisher for subsequent games—including Zork II and III, built from the remaining unused material from the original PDP-10 Zork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zork became available in December 1980 and sold 10,000 units in 1981, mostly on the Apple II, despite an eye-watering price of $39.95, at a time when most games cost fifteen to twenty-five dollars. Then, astonishingly, in an industry typically characterized by ephemerality and obsolescence, sales continued to grow, year after year. They peaked in 1984 with over 150,000 copies sold. No doubt Zork’s self-referential humor, its restrained but clever marketing, and the high quality of the game itself (certainly the most well-crafted adventure game to date) all helped to sell the game.[20]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But many sales also must have arisen from the startling impression given by sitting down in a store (or at a friend’s house) to interact with this remarkable piece of software. Bob Liddil, reviewing Zork for BYTE magazine, pointed to the fluency of the parser as the element that first pulled him in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I was eager to test Zork’s biggest selling point, intelligent input (ie: its ability to accept free-form instructions). I typed “OPEN THE BAG AND GET THE LUNCH,” in reference to a brown paper sack inside the house. The computer complied. There was water and food, so I typed “EAT THE LUNCH AND DRINK THE WATER,” to which the computer responded with gratitude for satisfying its hunger and thirst. I was hooked.[21]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game seemed to understand the user and to have an appropriate answer (or a witty retort) ready for everything they might try, from expletives (“FUCK &amp;gt; SUCH LANGUAGE IN A HIGH-CLASS ESTABLISHMENT LIKE THIS!”) to attempts to outwit the command system (“FIND HANDS &amp;gt; WITHIN SIX FEET OF YOUR HEAD, ASSUMING YOU HAVEN’T LEFT THAT SOMEWHERE.”), to questions about the imaginary world in which the game is played (“WHAT IS A ZORKMID? &amp;gt; THE ZORKMID IS THE UNIT OF CURRENCY OF THE GREAT UNDERGROUND EMPIRE.”) Along with VisiCalc and WordStar, Zork functioned not just as a piece of software that did something, but also as an existence proof (for the owner and for skeptical friends and family) that the microcomputer could be more than merely a toy version of a real computer.[22]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zork sales finally fell off in the mid-1980s, not because new text adventure games had surpassed it (Infocom continued to rule that particular roost, and Zork remained their flagship), but because of the steady improvement in personal computer graphics and the corresponding ascendancy of graphical games over textual ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Mystery House&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first graphical adventure game actually appeared several months before Zork: On-Line Systems’ Mystery House, created by Ken and Roberta Williams. Unlike Scott Adams and most of the early personal computer hobbyists, Ken Williams got into computers for money, not love. Raised in greater Los Angeles in an unhappy home, he was a driven and impatient young man, and graduated high school at just sixteen. Roberta Heuer, a dreamy young woman whom Williams met through a double date, was impressed enough by his intelligence and ambition to give in to his insistence that they marry in 1972, while they were both still teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the expectation of children to come, Ken abandoned his physics program at Cal Poly Pomona for a more immediately lucrative career in data processing. His father-in-law helped him get a loan to attend Control Data Corporation’s training school (the Control Data Institute), and from there he went on to a series of positions working on “big iron” batch-processing systems, constantly bouncing from job to job and home to home in search of better opportunities and a fatter pay check. He and Roberta wanted a bigger house and more creature comforts, but most of all they dreamed of an early retirement to a life out-of-doors, far from the city.[23]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Williamses took no notice of microcomputers until Ken and one of his co-workers, Robert Leff, concocted a way to make money off of them: selling fellow programmers a microcomputer implementation of FORTRAN, one of the most popular data processing languages. Not only could this venture make him and Roberta still richer (always a key consideration), it could free them to finally move away from the traffic and grind of Los Angeles and to live out their dream of rural life. Initially Ken planned to write FORTRAN for the TRS-80, but he redirected his energies to the more capable Apple II after he and Roberta got themselves one for a mutual Christmas present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Roberta had gotten hooked on adventure games. Ken had an electromechanical teletype terminal in their home for one of his consulting jobs, and connected it to a computer with the Crowther-Woods Adventure available to play. He showed the game off to Roberta. For Ken it was a curiosity, but for Roberta it became an obsession: she would not quit until she had beaten the game, weeks later. Ken brought home a borrowed TRS-80 and cassette tapes for the Scott Adams adventure series, and she flew through those, too. Soon she had an idea for a game of her own: instead of a treasure hunt, it would be a murder mystery; a mix of Clue and Ten Little Indians set in a creepy old Victorian house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She insisted that Ken help her create it, and, after putting her off several times, he finally relented. Roberta wanted to add pictures of each room as a way to make this new game better than what came before, taking advantage of the Apple II’s 280×192 pixel high-resolution graphics mode. Because storing dozens of bitmapped images on a floppy disk would be impossible, Ken bought a VersaWriter accessory, a tablet with a movable arm that let Roberta capture the (x, y) position of each line endpoint in her pictures and store them into the computer. He wrote code to re-create the pictures from these coordinates by drawing the lines at runtime.[24]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Crowther and Adams, Ken split the data tables apart from the code that interpreted them. This allowed Roberta to work out all of the information about the rooms in the game, the items they contain, and the actions the player can perform, without needing to write any code. This division of labor between programming and design, quite novel to computer game software, came about from the accident of Roberta’s limited technical skills (she had worked briefly as COBOL programmer, at Ken’s insistence) and Ken’s lack of interest in the game: he was still focused on launching Apple FORTRAN.[25]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, while visiting local computer stores to pitch his computer language, Ken demoed an early version of Roberta’s game and everyone in the store gathered around to see it. The owners asked when they could have copies to sell. Ken realized he was backing the wrong horse: it was Roberta’s side project that would make them rich, not FORTRAN. Moreover, rather than give up a cut to a publisher like Programma International, they would take all the revenue for themselves, by publishing the game through the company name he had already registered for his never-to-be-released FORTRAN, On-Line Systems. On top of that, they could make even more money by distributing games into the stores they were already visiting on behalf of other software authors, like Scott Adams’ Florida-based Adventure International. Eventually unable to manage both publishing and distribution, he convinced his former colleague and erstwhile FORTRAN partner, Robert Leff, to buy out the distribution business, which grew into the industry behemoth Softsel.[26]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a month of development on nights and weekends (Ken’s pace was manic: in his memoir he writes that he always strove to be a “Triple-A” player, and his brother called him a “chronic workaholic”), the Williams’ started selling Mystery House in May 1980. It required forty-eight kilobytes of memory, but with chip prices falling continuously, this was not so stringent a requirement as it had been even a year before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game’s simplistic “mystery” ends with the player gunning down the de facto murderer: the only living character to be found in a houseful of victims. The puzzles are among the more poorly clued and arbitrary to be found in a genre full of such frustrations. But for adventure-starved gamers of the time it was enchanting: not only could they witness the virtual world which they were navigating, it actually changed in response to their actions (picking up an object, like the taunting note that kicked off the murders, would remove it from the scene). Roberta’s drawings, crude and child-like as they certainly are, gave the game a visual appeal that drew in new buyers, and more than justified its price of $24.95.[27]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That summer Ken and Roberta were pulling in $30,000 a month and shopping for a house far from Los Angeles, in Coarsegold, California, nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park. On-Line Systems became Sierra On-Line. A few months later a second “High-Res Adventure” followed, The Wizard and the Princess, which added visually-stunning color to Mystery House’s line drawings: Ken used dithering techniques to make the six colors available in high-res mode appear like twenty-one. Roberta’s King’s Quest series, which I encountered on my Apple II, did not begin until 1984. It became Sierra’s best seller: by 1987, the first three installments of the series had sold a combined 500,000 copies, at least according to Sierra’s own marketing.[28]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It stands out, in a story populated almost entirely with male characters, that two of the earliest adventure game designers (Alexis Adams and Roberta Williams) were women. The scope of Alexis’ contributions aren’t entirely clear, but Roberta was arguably the most successful adventure game designer of all time. There was an appeal in the adventure game genre, which had more in common with a mystery novel or a logic puzzle than an arcade game and typically eschewed violence (the summary execution of Mystery House’s killer notwithstanding), that attracted some women to an otherwise almost entirely masculine industry.[29]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world where multiple discovery and parallel invention are the norm, it is also remarkable that all of the games we have discussed (and indeed all the computer adventure games ever made) can trace their ancestry to the Crowther-Woods Adventure. In the meantime, though, many other computer game authors had drawn inspiration from Dungeons and Dragons, spawning an entirely different genre of computer games, more in tune with D&amp;amp;D’s wargaming roots.&lt;/p&gt;

The account in the previous paragraphs is interpolated from the above sources, which are partially contradictory. All differ about who got the Apple II and why. Levy never mentions the TRS-80 or any adventure games besides Adventure, and has Roberta finishing that game after the time the Apple II was purchased, implying she never played any other adventure games before deciding to write Mystery House: the timeline would simply be too tight. I believe this is wrong, and either an intentional elision or a false interpolation by Levy. It is unlikely that the Williamses would later entirely hallucinate having brought home and played the whole series of Scott Adams games. The accounts also differ on whose idea it was to add pictures to the game. I’m inclined to believe it was Roberta, to whom the game idea and all the passion for it belonged.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Fed 24 Years of My Blog Posts to a Markov Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I shared a little program called Mark V. Shaney Junior at github.com/susam/mvs. It is a minimal implementation of a Markov text generator inspired by the legendary Mark V. Shaney program from the 1980s. If you don't know about Mark V. Shaney, read more about it on the Wikipedia article Mark V. Shaney.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a very small program with only about 30 lines of Python that favours simplicity over efficiency. As a hobby, I often engage in exploratory programming where I write computer programs not to solve a specific problem but simply to explore a particular idea or topic for the sole purpose of recreation. I must have written small programs to explore Markov chains for various kinds of state spaces over a dozen times by now. Every time, I just pick my last experimental code and edit it to encode the new state space I am exploring. That's usually my general approach to such one-off programs. I have hundreds of tiny little experimental programs lying on my disk at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Once in a while, I get the itch to take one of those exploratory programs, give it some finishing touches, wrap it up in a nice Git repo along with a &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CHANGES.md&lt;/code&gt;
  and the whole shebang and share it on
  github.com/susam and
  codeberg.org/susam.  The
  Mark V. Shaney Junior program that I shared yesterday happened to be
  one such exercise.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you scroll down the README of this project, you'll find some nice examples of the gibberish produced by this program. The first few examples there are the result of training the model on A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, one of my favourite authors. It is often said that Dickens never used fewer words when more would suffice. So I thought there couldn't be a better piece of text when it comes to testing out my tiny Markov model. I'll not reproduce the generated text examples here for the sake of brevity. If you are interested to take a look, just head over to the Gibberish section of the README.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon after sharing the project, I wondered what kind of gibberish it would produce if I fed all 24 years of my blog posts and pages into the program. Well, here's one of the results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ ./mvs &amp;lt; susam.txt while a query replace operation is approved by the user. The above variable defines the build job. It can be incredibly useful while working on assembly language and machine code. In fact, all internal resources like the result to refine the search prompt changes from bck-i-search: to fwd-i-search:. Now type C-SPC (i.e. ctrl+space) to set a mark causes Emacs to use 32-bit registers like EBP, ESP, etc. Thus the behaviour is undefined. Such code may behave differently when compiled with the readily available GNU tools like the shape of 8. Flipping "P" horizontally makes it a proper quine: cat $0&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the text that comes out after the program consumes over 200 posts consisting of about 200,000 words. My blog also has a comments section with over 500 comments consisting of about 40,000 words. All comments were excluded while training the model. Here is another output example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ ./mvs &amp;lt; susam.txt enjoy asking "what happens if" and then type M-x zap-up-to-char RET b. The buffer for this specific video, the actual fare for 8.3 km and 11 are all written from scratch. No prior knowledge is expected to slow down in future. For now, I will add a statement like x = 0.999... , the inner corner square as discussed in the code segment into the REPL window. Unlike Slimv, Vlime can work with and debug executable files, it can be more convenient. M-x: Execute Extended Command The key sequence M-q invokes the command cat and type TAB to indent the&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a particularly incoherent but amusing one:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ ./mvs &amp;lt; susam.txt Then open a new Lisp source file and the exact answer could harm students' self-esteem. Scientists have arbitrarily assumed that an integral domain. However, the string and comment text. To demonstrate how a build job can trigger itself, pass input to standard output or standard error), Eshell automatically runs the following command in Vim and Emacs will copy the message length limit of 512 characters, etc. For example, while learning to play the game between normal mode to move the point is on an old dictionary lying around our house and that is moving to the small and supportive community&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, I have never said anywhere that opening a Lisp source file could harm anyone's self-esteem. The text generator has picked up the 'Lisp source file' phrase from my Lisp in Vim post and the 'self-esteem' bit from the From Perl to Pi post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, this program looks at trigrams (all sequences of three adjacent words) and creates a map where the first two words of the trigram are inserted as the key and the third word is appended to its list value. This map is the model. In this way, the model captures each pair of adjacent words along with the words that immediately follow each pair. The text generator then chooses a key (a pair of words) at random and looks for a word which follows. If there are multiple followers, it picks one at random. That is pretty much the whole algorithm. There isn't much more to it. It is as simple as it gets. For that reason, I often describe a simple Markov model like this as the 'hello, world' for language models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, in 2025, given the overwhelming popularity of large language models (LLMs), Markov models like this look unimpressive. Unlike LLMs, a simple Markov model cannot capture global structure or long-range dependencies within the text. It relies entirely on local word transition statistics. Also, these days, one hardly needs a Markov model to generate gibberish; social media provides an ample supply. Nevertheless, I think the simplicity of its design and implementation serves as a good entry point into language models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my implementation, the number of words in the key of the map can be set via command line arguments. By default, it is 2 as described above. This value is also known as the order of the model. So by default the order is 2. If we increase it to, say, 3 or 4, the generated text becomes a little more coherent. Here is one such example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ ./mvs 4 &amp;lt; susam.txt It is also possible to search for channels by channel names. For example, on Libera Chat, to search for all channels with 'python' in its name, enter the IRC command: /msg alis list python. Although I have used Libera Chat in the examples above, there are plenty of infinite fields, so they must all be integral domains too. Consider the field of rational numbers Q. Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that when one knight is placed on a type D square, only two positions for the second knight such that the two knights attack&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except for a couple of abrupt and meaningless transitions, the text is mostly coherent. We need to be careful about not increasing the order too much. In fact, if we increase the order of the model to 5, the generated text becomes very dry and factual because it begins to quote large portions of the blog posts verbatim. Not much fun can be had with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I end this post, let me present one final example where I ask it to generate text from an initial prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;$ ./mvs 2 100 'Finally we' &amp;lt; susam.txt Finally we divide this number by a feed aggregrator for Emacs-related blogs. The following complete key sequences describe the effects of previous evaluations shall have taken a simple and small to contain bad content. This provides an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function in MATLAB and GNU bash 5.1.4 on Debian is easily reproducible in Windows XP. Older versions might be able to run that server for me it played a significant burden on me as soon as possible. C-u F: Visit the marked files or directories in the sense that it was already initiated and we were to complete the proof.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently, this is how I would sound if I ever took up speaking gibberish!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to read:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microservices is a service-oriented software architecture in which server-side applications are constructed by combining many single-purpose, low-footprint network services. The touted benefits are improved modularity, reduced testing burden, better functional composition, environmental isolation, and development team autonomy. The opposite is a Monolithic architecture, where a large amount of functionality lives in a single service which is tested, deployed, and scaled as a single unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twilio Segment adopted this as a best practice early-on, which served us well in some cases, and, as you’ll soon learn, not so well in others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early days of Twilio Segment, we reached a tipping point with a core piece of Twilio Segment’s product. It seemed as if we were falling from the microservices tree, hitting every branch on the way down. Instead of enabling us to move faster, the small team found themselves mired in exploding complexity. Essential benefits of this architecture became burdens. As our velocity plummeted, our defect rate exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, the team found themselves unable to make headway, with 3 full-time engineers spending most of their time just keeping the system alive. Something had to change. This post is the story of how we took a step back and embraced an approach that aligned well with our product requirements and needs of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Microservices worked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twilio Segment’s customer data infrastructure ingests hundreds of thousands of events per second and forwards them to partner APIs, what we refer to as server-side destinations. There are over one hundred types of these destinations, such as Google Analytics, Optimizely, or a custom webhook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years back, when the product initially launched, the architecture was simple. There was an API that ingested events and forwarded them to a distributed message queue. An event, in this case, is a JSON object generated by a web or mobile app containing information about users and their actions. A sample payload looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As events were consumed from the queue, customer-managed settings were checked to decide which destinations should receive the event. The event was then sent to each destination’s API, one after another, which was useful because developers only need to send their event to a single endpoint, Twilio Segment’s API, instead of building potentially dozens of integrations. Twilio Segment handles making the request to every destination endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If one of the requests to a destination fails, sometimes we’ll try sending that event again at a later time. Some failures are safe to retry while others are not. Retry-able errors are those that could potentially be accepted by the destination with no changes. For example, HTTP 500s, rate limits, and timeouts. Non-retry-able errors are requests that we can be sure will never be accepted by the destination. For example, requests which have invalid credentials or are missing required fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, a single queue contained both the newest events as well as those which may have had several retry attempts, across all destinations, which resulted in head-of-line blocking. Meaning in this particular case, if one destination slowed or went down, retries would flood the queue, resulting in delays across all our destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine destination X is experiencing a temporary issue and every request errors with a timeout. Now, not only does this create a large backlog of requests which have yet to reach destination X, but also every failed event is put back to retry in the queue. While our systems would automatically scale in response to increased load, the sudden increase in queue depth would outpace our ability to scale up, resulting in delays for the newest events. Delivery times for all destinations would increase because destination X had a momentary outage. Customers rely on the timeliness of this delivery, so we can’t afford increases in wait times anywhere in our pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve the head-of-line blocking problem, the team created a separate service and queue for each destination. This new architecture consisted of an additional router process that receives the inbound events and distributes a copy of the event to each selected destination. Now if one destination experienced problems, only it’s queue would back up and no other destinations would be impacted. This microservice-style architecture isolated the destinations from one another, which was crucial when one destination experienced issues as they often do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Case for Individual Repos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each destination API uses a different request format, requiring custom code to translate the event to match this format. A basic example is destination X requires sending birthday as traits.dob in the payload whereas our API accepts it as traits.birthday. The transformation code in destination X would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many modern destination endpoints have adopted Twilio Segment’s request format making some transforms relatively simple. However, these transforms can be very complex depending on the structure of the destination’s API. For example, for some of the older and most sprawling destinations, we find ourselves shoving values into hand-crafted XML payloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, when the destinations were divided into separate services, all of the code lived in one repo. A huge point of frustration was that a single broken test caused tests to fail across all destinations. When we wanted to deploy a change, we had to spend time fixing the broken test even if the changes had nothing to do with the initial change. In response to this problem, it was decided to break out the code for each destination into their own repos. All the destinations were already broken out into their own service, so the transition was natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The split to separate repos allowed us to isolate the destination test suites easily. This isolation allowed the development team to move quickly when maintaining destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scaling Microservices and Repos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As time went on, we added over 50 new destinations, and that meant 50 new repos. To ease the burden of developing and maintaining these codebases, we created shared libraries to make common transforms and functionality, such as HTTP request handling, across our destinations easier and more uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if we want the name of a user from an event, event.name() can be called in any destination’s code. The shared library checks the event for the property key name and Name. If those don’t exist, it checks for a first name, checking the properties firstName, first_name, and FirstName. It does the same for the last name, checking the cases and combining the two to form the full name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shared libraries made building new destinations quick. The familiarity brought by a uniform set of shared functionality made maintenance less of a headache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a new problem began to arise. Testing and deploying changes to these shared libraries impacted all of our destinations. It began to require considerable time and effort to maintain. Making changes to improve our libraries, knowing we’d have to test and deploy dozens of services, was a risky proposition. When pressed for time, engineers would only include the updated versions of these libraries on a single destination’s codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the versions of these shared libraries began to diverge across the different destination codebases. The great benefit we once had of reduced customization between each destination codebase started to reverse. Eventually, all of them were using different versions of these shared libraries. We could’ve built tools to automate rolling out changes, but at this point, not only was developer productivity suffering but we began to encounter other issues with the microservice architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The additional problem is that each service had a distinct load pattern. Some services would handle a handful of events per day while others handled thousands of events per second. For destinations that handled a small number of events, an operator would have to manually scale the service up to meet demand whenever there was an unexpected spike in load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we did have auto-scaling implemented, each service had a distinct blend of required CPU and memory resources, which made tuning the auto-scaling configuration more art than science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of destinations continued to grow rapidly, with the team adding three destinations per month on average, which meant more repos, more queues, and more services. With our microservice architecture, our operational overhead increased linearly with each added destination. Therefore, we decided to take a step back and rethink the entire pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ditching Microservices and Queues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first item on the list was to consolidate the now over 140 services into a single service. The overhead from managing all of these services was a huge tax on our team. We were literally losing sleep over it since it was common for the on-call engineer to get paged to deal with load spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the architecture at the time would have made moving to a single service challenging. With a separate queue per destination, each worker would have to check every queue for work, which would have added a layer of complexity to the destination service with which we weren’t comfortable. This was the main inspiration for Centrifuge. Centrifuge would replace all our individual queues and be responsible for sending events to the single monolithic service. (Note that Centrifuge became the back-end infrastructure for Connections.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moving to a Monorepo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that there would only be one service, it made sense to move all the destination code into one repo, which meant merging all the different dependencies and tests into a single repo. We knew this was going to be messy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each of the 120 unique dependencies, we committed to having one version for all our destinations. As we moved destinations over, we’d check the dependencies it was using and update them to the latest versions. We fixed anything in the destinations that broke with the newer versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this transition, we no longer needed to keep track of the differences between dependency versions. All our destinations were using the same version, which significantly reduced the complexity across the codebase. Maintaining destinations now became less time consuming and less risky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also wanted a test suite that allowed us to quickly and easily run all our destination tests. Running all the tests was one of the main blockers when making updates to the shared libraries we discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the destination tests all had a similar structure. They had basic unit tests to verify our custom transform logic was correct and would execute HTTP requests to the partner’s endpoint to verify that events showed up in the destination as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that the original motivation for separating each destination codebase into its own repo was to isolate test failures. However, it turned out this was a false advantage. Tests that made HTTP requests were still failing with some frequency. With destinations separated into their own repos, there was little motivation to clean up failing tests. This poor hygiene led to a constant source of frustrating technical debt. Often a small change that should have only taken an hour or two would end up requiring a couple of days to a week to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building a Resilient Test Suite&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outbound HTTP requests to destination endpoints during the test run was the primary cause of failing tests. Unrelated issues like expired credentials shouldn’t fail tests. We also knew from experience that some destination endpoints were much slower than others. Some destinations took up to 5 minutes to run their tests. With over 140 destinations, our test suite could take up to an hour to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve for both of these, we created Traffic Recorder. Traffic Recorder is built on top of yakbak, and is responsible for recording and saving destinations’ test traffic. Whenever a test runs for the first time, any requests and their corresponding responses are recorded to a file. On subsequent test runs, the request and response in the file is played back instead requesting the destination’s endpoint. These files are checked into the repo so that the tests are consistent across every change. Now that the test suite is no longer dependent on these HTTP requests over the internet, our tests became significantly more resilient, a must-have for the migration to a single repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took milliseconds to complete running the tests for all 140+ of our destinations after we integrated Traffic Recorder. In the past, just one destination could have taken a couple of minutes to complete. It felt like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why a Monolith works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the code for all destinations lived in a single repo, they could be merged into a single service. With every destination living in one service, our developer productivity substantially improved. We no longer had to deploy 140+ services for a change to one of the shared libraries. One engineer can deploy the service in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof was in the improved velocity. When our microservice architecture was still in place, we made 32 improvements to our shared libraries. One year later, we’ve made 46 improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change also benefited our operational story. With every destination living in one service, we had a good mix of CPU and memory-intense destinations, which made scaling the service to meet demand significantly easier. The large worker pool can absorb spikes in load, so we no longer get paged for destinations that process small amounts of load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Trade Offs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving from our microservice architecture to a monolith overall was huge improvement, however, there are trade-offs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fault isolation is difficult. With everything running in a monolith, if a bug is introduced in one destination that causes the service to crash, the service will crash for all destinations. We have comprehensive automated testing in place, but tests can only get you so far. We are currently working on a much more robust way to prevent one destination from taking down the entire service while still keeping all the destinations in a monolith.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In-memory caching is less effective. Previously, with one service per destination, our low traffic destinations only had a handful of processes, which meant their in-memory caches of control plane data would stay hot. Now that cache is spread thinly across 3000+ processes so it’s much less likely to be hit. We could use something like Redis to solve for this, but then that’s another point of scaling for which we’d have to account. In the end, we accepted this loss of efficiency given the substantial operational benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Updating the version of a dependency may break multiple destinations. While moving everything to one repo solved the previous dependency mess we were in, it means that if we want to use the newest version of a library, we’ll potentially have to update other destinations to work with the newer version. In our opinion though, the simplicity of this approach is worth the trade-off. And with our comprehensive automated test suite, we can quickly see what breaks with a newer dependency version.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial microservice architecture worked for a time, solving the immediate performance issues in our pipeline by isolating the destinations from each other. However, we weren’t set up to scale. We lacked the proper tooling for testing and deploying the microservices when bulk updates were needed. As a result, our developer productivity quickly declined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving to a monolith allowed us to rid our pipeline of operational issues while significantly increasing developer productivity. We didn’t make this transition lightly though and knew there were things we had to consider if it was going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We needed a rock solid testing suite to put everything into one repo. Without this, we would have been in the same situation as when we originally decided to break them apart. Constant failing tests hurt our productivity in the past, and we didn’t want that happening again.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We accepted the trade-offs inherent in a monolithic architecture and made sure we had a good story around each. We had to be comfortable with some of the sacrifices that came with this change.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When deciding between microservices or a monolith, there are different factors to consider with each. In some parts of our infrastructure, microservices work well but our server-side destinations were a perfect example of how this popular trend can actually hurt productivity and performance. It turns out, the solution for us was a monolith.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🍯 At least 2 days ago&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loved reading through GReg TeChnoLogY Anthony Bourdain’s Lost Li.st’s and seeing the list of lost Anthony Bourdain li.st’s made me think on whether at least some of them we can recover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having worked in security and crawling space for majority of my career—I don’t have the access nor permission to use the proprietary storages—I thought we might be able to find something from publicly available crawl archives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the code and examples lead to the source git repository. This article has also been discussed on hackernews. Also, a week before I published this, mirandom had the same idea as me and published their findings—go check them out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Internet Archive had the partial list that Greg published, what about the Common Crawl? Reading through their documentation, it seems straightforward enough to get prefix index for Tony’s lists and grep for any sub-paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Putting something up with help of Claude to prove my theory, we have &lt;code&gt;commoncrawl_search.py&lt;/code&gt; that makes a single index request to a specific dataset and if any hits discovered, retrieve them from the public s3 bucket—since they are small straight-up HTML documents, seems even more feasible than I had initially thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Simply have a python version around 3.14.2 and install the dependencies from &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;. Run the below and we are in business. Now, below, you’ll find the command I ran and then some manual archeological effort to prettify the findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python commoncrawl_search.py "https://li.st/Bourdain*" --all --download&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Any and all emphasis, missing punctuation, cool grammar is all by Anthony Bourdain. The only modifications I have made is to the layout, to represent &lt;code&gt;li.st&lt;/code&gt; as closely as possible with no changes to the content.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; From Greg’s page, let’s go and try each entry one by one, I’ll put the table of what I wasn’t able to find in Common Crawl, but I would assume exists elsewhere—I’d be happy to take another look. And no, none of this above has been written by AI, only the code since I don’t really care about &lt;code&gt;warcio&lt;/code&gt; encoding or writing the same python requests method for the Nth time. Enjoy!

    &lt;p&gt;Dinners where it takes the waiter longer to describe my food than it takes me to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beer nerds&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I admit it: my life doesn’t suck. Some recent views I’ve enjoyed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montana at sunset : There’s pheasant cooking behind the camera somewhere. To the best of my recollection some very nice bourbon. And it IS a big sky .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico: Thank you Jose Andres for inviting me to this beautiful beach!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naxos: drinking ouzo and looking at this. Not a bad day at the office .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LA: My chosen final resting place . Exact coordinates .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Istanbul: raki and grilled lamb and this ..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Borneo: The air is thick with hints of durian, sambal, coconut..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chicago: up early to go train #Redzovic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Wire&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (and its sequel : Smiley’s People)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edge of Darkness (with Bob Peck and Joe Don Baker )&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dreamcasting across time with the living and the dead, this untitled, yet to be written masterwork of cinema, shot, no doubt, by Christopher Doyle, lives only in my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This guy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this guy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All great films need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Oscar goes to..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you bought these vinyls from an emaciated looking dude with an eager, somewhat distracted expression on his face somewhere on upper Broadway sometime in the mid 80’s, that was me . I’d like them back. In a sentimental mood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;material things I feel a strange, possibly unnatural attraction to and will buy (if I can) if I stumble across them in my travels. I am not a paid spokesperson for any of this stuff .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vintage Persol sunglasses : This is pretty obvious. I wear them a lot. I collect them when I can. Even my production team have taken to wearing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;19th century trepanning instruments: I don’t know what explains my fascination with these devices, designed to drill drain-sized holes into the skull often for purposes of relieving "pressure" or "bad humours". But I can’t get enough of them. Tip: don’t get a prolonged headache around me and ask if I have anything for it. I do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Montagnard bracelets: I only have one of these but the few that find their way onto the market have so much history. Often given to the indigenous mountain people ’s Special Forces advisors during the very early days of America’s involvement in Vietnam .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jiu Jitsi Gi’s: Yeah. When it comes to high end BJJ wear, I am a total whore. You know those people who collect limited edition Nikes ? I’m like that but with Shoyoroll . In my defense, I don’t keep them in plastic bags in a display case. I wear that shit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voiture: You know those old school, silver plated (or solid silver) blimp like carts they roll out into the dining room to carve and serve your roast? No. Probably not. So few places do that anymore. House of Prime Rib does it. Danny Bowein does it at Mission Chinese. I don’t have one of these. And I likely never will. But I can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kramer knives: I don’t own one. I can’t afford one . And I’d likely have to wait for years even if I could afford one. There’s a long waiting list for these individually hand crafted beauties. But I want one. Badly. http://www.kramerknives.com/gallery/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;R. CRUMB : All of it. The collected works. These Taschen volumes to start. I wanted to draw brilliant, beautiful, filthy comix like Crumb until I was 13 or 14 and it became clear that I just didn’t have that kind of talent. As a responsible father of an 8 year old girl, I just can’t have this stuff in the house. Too dark, hateful, twisted. Sigh...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS : THE UNCUT, ORIGINAL ORSON WELLES VERSION: It doesn’t exist. Which is why I want it. The Holy Grail for film nerds, Welles’ follow up to CITIZEN KANE shoulda, coulda been an even greater masterpiece . But the studio butchered it and re-shot a bullshit ending. I want the original. I also want a magical pony.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like good spy novels. I prefer them to be realistic . I prefer them to be written by real spies. If the main character carries a gun, I’m already losing interest. Spy novels should be about betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Ashenden–Somerset Maugham&lt;lb/&gt;Somerset wrote this bleak, darkly funny, deeply cynical novel in the early part of the 20th century. It was apparently close enough to the reality of his espionage career that MI6 insisted on major excisions. Remarkably ahead of its time in its atmosphere of futility and betrayal. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Man Who Lost the War–WT Tyler&lt;lb/&gt;WT Tyler is a pseudonym for a former "foreign service" officer who could really really write. This one takes place in post-war Berlin and elsewhere and was, in my opinion, wildly under appreciated. See also his Ants of God. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Human Factor–Graham Greene&lt;lb/&gt;Was Greene thinking of his old colleague Kim Philby when he wrote this? Maybe. Probably. See also Our Man In Havana. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The Tears of Autumn -Charles McCarry&lt;lb/&gt;A clever take on the JFK assassination with a Vietnamese angle. See also The Miernik Dossier and The Last Supper &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Agents of Innocence–David Ignatius&lt;lb/&gt;Ignatius is a journalist not a spook, but this one, set in Beirut, hewed all too closely to still not officially acknowledged events. Great stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wake up in a lot of hotels, so I am fiercely loyal to the ones I love. A hotel where I know immediately wher I am when I open my eyes in the morning is a rare joy. Here are some of my favorites&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHATEAU MARMONT ( LA) : if I have to die in a hotel room, let it be here. I will work in LA just to stay at the Chateau.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHILTERN FIREHOUSE (London): Same owner as the Chateau. An amazing Victorian firehouse turned hotel. Pretty much perfection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE RALEIGH (Miami): The pool. The pool!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LE CONTINENTAL (Saigon): For the history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HOTEL OLOFSSON (Port au Prince): Sagging, creaky and leaky but awesome .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PARK HYATT (Tokyo): Because I’m a film geek.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDGEWATER INN (Seattle): kind of a lumber theme going on...ships slide right by your window. And the Led Zep "Mudshark incident".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE METROPOLE (Hanoi): there’s a theme developing: if Graham Greene stayed at a hotel, chances are I will too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GRAND HOTEL D'ANGKOR (Siem Reap): I’m a sucker for grand, colonial era hotels in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE MURRAY (Livingston,Montana): You want the Peckinpah suite&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;from my phone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bun Bo Hue&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kuching Laksa&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pot au Feu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jamon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linguine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dessert&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Light Lunch&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meat on a Stick&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oily Little Fish&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Snack&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Homage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not TOO random&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Madeline&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beirut&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Musubi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BudaeJiggae&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dinner&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootsy Collins&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bill Murray&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spaghetti a la bottarga . I would really, really like some of this. Al dente, lots of chili flakes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big, greasy double cheeseburger. No lettuce. No tomato. Potato bun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A street fair sausage and pepper hero would be nice. Though shitting like a mink is an inevitable and near immediate outcome&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some uni. Fuck it. I’ll smear it on an English muffin at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if that cheese is still good?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In which my Greek idyll is Suddenly invaded by professional nudists&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Endemic FUPA. Apparently a prerequisite for joining this outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pistachio dick&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;70’s bush&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;T-shirt and no pants. Leading one to the obvious question : why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Popeye’s Mac and Cheese&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cheesy crust on the side of the bowl of Onion Soup Gratinee&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Macaroons . Not macarons . Macaroons&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Captain Crunch&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double Double Animal Style&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spam Musubi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aerosmith&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before he died, Warren Zevon dropped this wisdom bomb: "Enjoy every sandwich". These are a few locals I’ve particularly enjoyed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PASTRAMI QUEEN: (1125 Lexington Ave. ) Pastrami Sandwich. Also the turkey with Russian dressing is not bad. Also the brisket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EISENBERG'S SANDWICH SHOP: ( 174 5th Ave.) Tuna salad on white with lettuce. I’d suggest drinking a lime Rickey or an Arnold Palmer with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE JOHN DORY OYSTER BAR: (1196 Broadway) the Carta di Musica with Bottarga and Chili is amazing. Is it a sandwich? Yes. Yes it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RANDOM STREET FAIRS: (Anywhere tube socks and stale spices are sold. ) New York street fairs suck. The same dreary vendors, same bad food. But those nasty sausage and pepper hero sandwiches are a siren song, luring me, always towards the rocks. Shitting like a mink almost immediately after is guaranteed but who cares?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BARNEY GREENGRASS : ( 541 Amsterdam Ave.) Chopped Liver on rye. The best chopped liver in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A work in progress&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SIBERIA in any of its iterations. The one on the subway being the best&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LADY ANNES FULL MOON SALOON a bar so nasty I’d bring out of town visitors there just to scare them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE LION'S HEAD old school newspaper hang out&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KELLY'S on 43rd and Lex. Notable for 25 cent drafts and regularly and reliably serving me when I was 15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE TERMINAL BAR legendary dive across from port authority&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BILLY'S TOPLESS (later, Billy’s Stopless) an atmospheric, working class place, perfect for late afternoon drinking where nobody hustled you for money and everybody knew everybody. Great all-hair metal jukebox . Naked breasts were not really the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE BAR AT HAWAII KAI. tucked away in a giant tiki themed nightclub in Times Square with a midget doorman and a floor show. Best place to drop acid EVER.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE NURSERY after hours bar decorated like a pediatrician’s office. Only the nursery rhyme characters were punk rockers of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was surprising to see that only one page was not recoverable from the common crawl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Title&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Date&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;David Bowie Related&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1/14/2016&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve enjoyed this little project tremendously—a little archeology project. Can we declare victory for at least this endeavor? Hopefully, we would be able to find images, but that’s a little tougher, since that era’s cloudfront is fully gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What else can we work on restoring and setting up some sort of a public archive to store them? I made this a git repository for the sole purpose so that anyone interested can contribute their interest and passion for these kinds of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you and until next time! ◼︎&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Some surprising things about DuckDuckGo you probably don't know&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We have hundreds of easter-egg logos (featuring our friendly mascot Dax Brown) that surface when you make certain queries on our search engine. Our subreddit is trying to catch ‘em all. They’ve certainly caught a lot, currently 504, but we keep adding more so it’s a moving target. The total as of this post is 594. I’m the one personally adding them in my spare time just for fun and I recently did a Duck Tales episode (our new podcast) with more details on the process. This incarnation of specialty logos is relatively new, so if you are a long-term user and haven’t noticed them, that’s probably why (aside from of course that you’d have to search one of these queries and notice the subtle change in logo). And, no promises, but I am taking requests.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is a rumor continuously circulating that we’re owned by Google, which of course couldn’t be farther from the truth. I was actually a witness in the U.S. v. Google trial for the DOJ. I think this rumor started because Google used to own the domain duck.com and was pointing it at Google search for several years. After my public and private complaining for those same years, in 2018 we finally convinced Google to give us the duck.com domain, which we now use for our email protection service, but the rumor still persists.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve been blocked in China since 2014, and are on-and-off blocked in several other countries too like Indonesia and India because we don’t censor search results.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We’ve been an independent company since our founding in 2008 and been working on our own search indexes for as many years. For over fifteen years now (that whole time) we’ve been doing our own knowledge graph index (like answers from Wikipedia), over ten years for local and other instant-answer indexes (like businesses), and in the past few years we’ve been ramping up our wider web index to support our Search Assist and Duck.ai features. DuckDuckGo began with me crawling the web in my basement, and in the early days, the FBI actually showed up at my front door since I had crawled one of their honeypots.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The plurality of our search traffic now comes from our own browsers. Yes, we have our own browsers with our search engine built in along with a ton of other protections. How do they compare to other popular browsers and extensions, you ask? We made a comparison page so you can see the differences. Our mobile browsers on iOS &amp;amp; Android launched back in 2018 (wow, that’s seven years ago), and our desktop browsers on Mac and Windows in 2022/23. Our iOS browser market share continues to climb and we’re now #3 in the U.S. (behind Safari and Chrome) and #4 on Android (behind Chrome, Samsung, and Firefox). People appreciate all the protections and the front-and-center (now customizable) fire button that quickly clears tabs and data in an (also customizable) animation of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;About 13% of U.S. adults self-report as a “current user” of DuckDuckGo. That’s way more than most people think. Our search market share is lower since all of those users don’t use us on all of their devices, especially on Android where Google makes it especially hard. Once you realize that then it is less surprising that we have the highest search market share on Mac at about 4% in the U.S., followed by iOS at about 3%. I’m talking about the U.S. here since about 44% of our searches are from the U.S., and no other country is double digits, but rounding out the top ten countries are Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, India, the Netherlands, Indonesia, Australia, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our approach to AI differs from most other companies trying to shove it down your throat in that we are dedicated to making all AI features private, useful, and optional. If you like AI, we offer private AI search answers at duckduckgo.com and private chat at duck.ai, which are built-into our browsers. If you don’t like or don’t want AI, that’s cool with us too. You can easily turn all of these features off. In fact, we made a noai.duckduckgo.com search domain that automatically sets those settings for you, including a recent setting we added that allows you to hide many AI-generated images within image search. Another related thing you might find surprising is search traffic has continued to grow steadily even since the rise of ChatGPT (with Duck.ai traffic growing even faster).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you didn’t know we have a browser, you probably also don’t know we have a DuckDuckGo Subscription (launched last year), that includes our VPN, more advanced AI models in Duck.ai, and in the U.S., Personal Information Removal and Identity Theft Restoration. It’s now available in 30 countries with a similar VPN footprint and our VPN is run by us (see latest security audit and free trials).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Speaking of lots of countries, our team has been completely distributed from the beginning, now at over 300 across about 30 countries as well, with less than half in the U.S. And we’re still hiring. We have a unique work culture that, among other things, avoids standing meetings on Wednesdays and Thursdays. We get the whole company together for a week once a year.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We played a critical role in the Global Privacy Control standard and the creation of search preference menus. I have a graduate degree in Technology and Public Policy and so we’ve done more of this kind of thing than one might expect, even going so far to draft our own Do Not Track legislation before we got GPC going. We also donate yearly to like-minded organizations (here’s our 2025 announcement), with our cumulative donations now at over $8 million. Check our donations page for details going back to 2011. We can do this since we’ve been profitable for about that long, and more recently have even started investing in related startups as well.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this hodge-podge of stuff makes you think of anything, please let me know. I’m not only taking requests for easter-egg logo ideas, but also for stuff to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Linux Sandboxes And Fil-C&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory safety and sandboxing are two different things. It's reasonable to think of them as orthogonal: you could have memory safety but not be sandboxed, or you could be sandboxed but not memory safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Example of memory safe but not sandboxed: a pure Java program that opens files on the filesystem for reading and writing and accepts filenames from the user. The OS will allow this program to overwrite any file that the user has access to. This program can be quite dangerous even if it is memory safe. Worse, imagine that the program didn't have any code to open files for reading and writing, but also had no sandbox to prevent those syscalls from working. If there was a bug in the memory safety enforcement of this program (say, because of a bug in the Java implementation), then an attacker could cause this program to overwrite any file if they succeeded at achieving code execution via weird state.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Example of sandboxed but not memory safe: a program written in assembly that starts by requesting that the OS revoke all of its capabilities beyond just pure compute. If the program did want to open a file or write to it, then the kernel will kill the process, based on the earlier request to have this capability revoked. This program could have lots of memory safety bugs (because it's written in assembly), but even if it did, then the attacker cannot make this program overwrite any file unless they find some way to bypass the sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, sandboxes have holes by design. A typical sandbox allows the program to send and receive messages to broker processes that have higher privileges. So, an attacker may first use a memory safety bug to make the sandboxed process send malicious messages, and then use those malicious messages to break into the brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best kind of defense is to have both a sandbox and memory safety. This document describes how to combine sandboxing and Fil-C's memory safety by explaining what it takes to port OpenSSH's seccomp-based Linux sandbox code to Fil-C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fil-C is a memory safe implementation of C and C++ and this site has a lot of documentation about it. Unlike most memory safe languages, Fil-C enforces safety down to where your code meets Linux syscalls and the Fil-C runtime is robust enough that it's possible to use it in low-level system components like &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;udevd&lt;/code&gt;. Lots of programs work in Fil-C, including OpenSSH, which makes use of seccomp-BPF sandboxing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This document focuses on how OpenSSH uses seccomp and other technologies on Linux to build a sandbox around its unprivileged &lt;code&gt;sshd-session&lt;/code&gt; process. Let's review what tools Linux gives us that OpenSSH uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt;to restrict the process's view of the filesystem.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running the process with the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sshd&lt;/code&gt;user and group, and giving that user/group no privileges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;setrlimit&lt;/code&gt;to prevent opening files, starting processes, or writing to files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;seccomp-BPF syscall filter to reduce the attack surface by allowlisting only the set of syscalls that are legitimate for the unprivileged process. Syscalls not in the allowlist will crash the process with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SIGSYS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chromium developers and the Mozilla developers both have excellent notes about how to do sandboxing on Linux using seccomp. Seccomp-BPF is a well-documented kernel feature that can be used as part of a larger sandboxing story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fil-C makes it easy to use &lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt; and different users and groups. The syscalls that are used for that part of the sandbox are trivially allowed by Fil-C and no special care is required to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;setrlimit&lt;/code&gt; and seccomp-BPF require special care because the Fil-C runtime starts threads, allocates memory, and performs synchronization. This document describes what you need to know to make effective use of those sandboxing technologies in Fil-C. First, I describe how to build a sandbox that prevents thread creation without breaking Fil-C's use of threads. Then, I describe what tweaks I had to make to OpenSSH's seccomp filter. Finally, I describe how the Fil-C runtime implements the syscalls used to install seccomp filters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preventing Thread Creation Without Breaking The Fil-C Runtime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fil-C runtime uses multiple background threads for garbage collection and has the ability to automatically shut those threads down when they are not in use. If the program wakes up and starts allocating memory again, then those threads are automatically restarted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting threads violates the "no new processes" rule that OpenSSH's &lt;code&gt;setrlimit&lt;/code&gt; sandbox tries to achieve (since threads are just lightweight processes on Linux). It also relies on syscalls like &lt;code&gt;clone3&lt;/code&gt; that are not part of OpenSSH's seccomp filter allowlist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be a regression to the sandbox to allow process creation just because the Fil-C runtime relies on it. Instead, I added a new API to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;stdfil.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void zlock_runtime_threads(void);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This forces the runtime to immediately create whatever threads it needs, and to disable shutting them down on demand. Then, I added a call to &lt;code&gt;zlock_runtime_threads()&lt;/code&gt; in OpenSSH's &lt;code&gt;ssh_sandbox_child&lt;/code&gt; function before either the &lt;code&gt;setrlimit&lt;/code&gt; or seccomp-BPF sandbox calls happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tweaks To The OpenSSH Sandbox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the use of &lt;code&gt;zlock_runtime_threads()&lt;/code&gt; prevents subsequent thread creation from happening, most of the OpenSSH sandbox just works. I did not have to change how OpenSSH uses &lt;code&gt;setrlimit&lt;/code&gt;. I did change the following about the seccomp filter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure results in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS&lt;/code&gt;rather than&lt;code&gt;SECCOMP_RET_KILL&lt;/code&gt;. This ensures that Fil-C's background threads are also killed if a sandbox violation occurs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_NORESERVE&lt;/code&gt;is added to the&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;allowlist, since the Fil-C allocator uses it. This is not a meaningful regression to the filter, since&lt;code&gt;MAP_NORESERVE&lt;/code&gt;is not a meaningful capability for an attacker to have.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sched_yield&lt;/code&gt;is allowed. This is not a dangerous syscall (it's semantically a no-op). The Fil-C runtime uses it as part of its lock implementation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing else had to change, since the filter already allowed all of the &lt;code&gt;futex&lt;/code&gt; syscalls that Fil-C uses for synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Fil-C Implements &lt;code&gt;prctl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSH seccomp filter is installed using two &lt;code&gt;prctl&lt;/code&gt; calls. First, we &lt;code&gt;PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0) == -1) {
        debug("%s: prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS): %s",
            __func__, strerror(errno));
        nnp_failed = 1;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prevents additional privileges from being acquired via &lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;. It's required that unprivileged processes that install seccomp filters first set the &lt;code&gt;no_new_privs&lt;/code&gt; bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we &lt;code&gt;PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &amp;amp;preauth_program) == -1)
        debug("%s: prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP): %s",
            __func__, strerror(errno));
else if (nnp_failed)
        fatal("%s: SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER activated but "
            "PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS failed", __func__);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This installs the seccomp filter in &lt;code&gt;preauth_program&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this will fail in the kernel if the &lt;code&gt;no_new_privs&lt;/code&gt; bit is not set, so the fact that OpenSSH reports a fatal error if the filter is installed without &lt;code&gt;no_new_privs&lt;/code&gt; is just healthy paranoia on the part of the OpenSSH authors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trouble with both syscalls is that they affect the calling thread, not all threads in the process. Without special care, Fil-C runtime's background threads would not have the &lt;code&gt;no_new_privs&lt;/code&gt; bit set and would not have the filter installed. This would mean that if an attacker busted through Fil-C's memory safety protections (in the unlikely event that they found a bug in Fil-C itself!), then they could use those other threads to execute syscalls that bypass the filter!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent even this unlikely escape, the Fil-C runtime's wrapper for &lt;code&gt;prctl&lt;/code&gt; implements &lt;code&gt;PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;PR_SET_SECCOMP&lt;/code&gt; by handshaking all runtime threads using this internal API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Calls the callback from every runtime thread. */
PAS_API void filc_runtime_threads_handshake(void (*callback)(void* arg), void* arg);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The callback performs the requested &lt;code&gt;prctl&lt;/code&gt; from each runtime thread. This ensures that the &lt;code&gt;no_new_privs&lt;/code&gt; bit and the filter are installed on all threads in the Fil-C process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, because of ambiguity about what to do if the process has multiple user threads, these two &lt;code&gt;prctl&lt;/code&gt; commands will trigger a Fil-C safety error if the program has multiple user threads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best kind of protection if you're serious about security is to combine memory safety with sandboxing. This document shows how to achieve this using Fil-C and the sandbox technologies available on Linux, all without regressing the level of protection that those sandboxes enforce or the memory safety guarantees of Fil-C.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; nullprogram.com/blog/2025/12/12/ &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2017 I wrote about a technique for creating closures in C using JIT-compiled wrapper. It’s neat, though rarely necessary in real programs, so I don’t think about it often. I applied it to &lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt;,
which sadly accepts no context pointer. More practical would be
working around insufficient custom allocator interfaces, to
create allocation functions at run-time bound to a particular allocation
region. I’ve learned a lot since I last wrote about this subject, and a
recent article had me thinking about it again, and how I could do
better than before. In this article I will enhance Win32 window procedure
callbacks with a fifth argument, allowing us to more directly pass extra
context. I’m using w64devkit on x64, but the everything here should
work out-of-the-box with any x64 toolchain that speaks GNU assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A window procedure has this prototype:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;LRESULT Wndproc(
  HWND hWnd,
  UINT Msg,
  WPARAM wParam,
  LPARAM lParam,
);
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a window we must first register a class with &lt;code&gt;RegisterClass&lt;/code&gt;,
which accepts a set of properties describing a window class, including a
pointer to one of these functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    MyState *state = ...;

    RegisterClassA(&amp;amp;(WNDCLASSA){
        // ...
        .lpfnWndProc   = my_wndproc,
        .lpszClassName = "my_class",
        // ...
    });

    HWND hwnd = CreateWindowExA("my_class", ..., state);
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thread drives a message pump with events from the operating system, dispatching them to this procedure, which then manipulates the program state in response:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    for (MSG msg; GetMessageW(&amp;amp;msg, 0, 0, 0);) {
        TranslateMessage(&amp;amp;msg);
        DispatchMessageW(&amp;amp;msg);  // calls the window procedure
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All four &lt;code&gt;WNDPROC&lt;/code&gt; parameters are determined by Win32. There is no context
pointer argument. So how does this procedure access the program state? We
generally have two options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global variables. Yucky but easy. Frequently seen in tutorials.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A &lt;code&gt;GWLP_USERDATA&lt;/code&gt; pointer attached to the window.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second option takes some setup. Win32 passes the last &lt;code&gt;CreateWindowEx&lt;/code&gt;
argument to the window procedure when the window created, via &lt;code&gt;WM_CREATE&lt;/code&gt;.
The procedure attaches the pointer to its window as &lt;code&gt;GWLP_USERDATA&lt;/code&gt;. This
pointer is passed indirectly, through a &lt;code&gt;CREATESTRUCT&lt;/code&gt;. So ultimately it
looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    case WM_CREATE:
        CREATESTRUCT *cs = (CREATESTRUCT *)lParam;
        void *arg = (struct state *)cs-&amp;gt;lpCreateParams;
        SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, GWLP_USERDATA, (LONG_PTR)arg);
        // ...
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In future messages we can retrieve it with &lt;code&gt;GetWindowLongPtr&lt;/code&gt;. Every time
I go through this I wish there was a better way. What if there was a fifth
window procedure parameter though which we could pass a context?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;typedef LRESULT Wndproc5(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM, void *);
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll build just this as a trampoline. The x64 calling convention passes the first four arguments in registers, and the rest are pushed on the stack, including this new parameter. Our trampoline cannot just stuff the extra parameter in the register, but will actually have to build a stack frame. Slightly more complicated, but barely so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Allocating executable memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous articles, and in the programs where I’ve applied techniques like this, I’ve allocated executable memory with &lt;code&gt;VirtualAlloc&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;
elsewhere). This introduces a small challenge for solving the problem
generally: Allocations may be arbitrarily far from our code and data, out
of reach of relative addressing. If they’re further than 2G apart, we need
to encode absolute addresses, and in the simple case would just assume
they’re always too far apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days I’ve more experience with executable formats, and allocation, and I immediately see a better solution: Request a block of writable, executable memory from the loader, then allocate our trampolines from it. Other than being executable, this memory isn’t special, and allocation works the usual way, using functions unaware it’s executable. By allocating through the loader, this memory will be part of our loaded image, guaranteed to be close to our other code and data, allowing our JIT compiler to assume a small code model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to do this, and here’s one way to do it with GNU-styled toolchains targeting COFF:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;        .section .exebuf,"bwx"
        .globl exebuf
exebuf:	.space 1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;21
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This assembly program defines a new section named &lt;code&gt;.exebuf&lt;/code&gt; containing 2M
of writable (&lt;code&gt;"w"&lt;/code&gt;), executable (&lt;code&gt;"x"&lt;/code&gt;) memory, allocated at run time just
like &lt;code&gt;.bss&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;"b"&lt;/code&gt;). We’ll treat this like an arena out of which we can
allocate all trampolines we’ll probably ever need. With careful use of
&lt;code&gt;.pushsection&lt;/code&gt; this could be basic inline assembly, but I’ve left it as a
separate source. On the C side I retrieve this like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    char *beg;
    char *end;
} Arena;

Arena get_exebuf()
{
    extern char exebuf[1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;21];
    Arena r = {exebuf, exebuf+sizeof(exebuf)};
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I have to repeat myself on the size. There are different ways to deal with this, but this is simple enough for now. I would have loved to define the array in C with the GCC &lt;code&gt;section&lt;/code&gt; attribute,
but as is usually the case with this attribute, it’s not up to the task,
lacking the ability to set section flags. Besides, by not relying on the
attribute, any C compiler could compile this source, and we only need a
GNU-style toolchain to create the tiny COFF object containing &lt;code&gt;exebuf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, a reminder of some other basic definitions we’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;#define S(s)            (Str){s, sizeof(s)-1}
#define new(a, n, t)    (t *)alloc(a, n, sizeof(t), _Alignof(t))

typedef struct {
    char     *data;
    ptrdiff_t len;
} Str;

Str clone(Arena *a, Str s)
{
    Str r = s;
    r.data = new(a, r.len, char);
    memcpy(r.data, s.data, (size_t)r.len);
    return r;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which have been discussed at length in previous articles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Trampoline compiler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here the plan is to create a function that accepts a &lt;code&gt;Wndproc5&lt;/code&gt; and a
context pointer to bind, and returns a classic &lt;code&gt;WNDPROC&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;WNDPROC make_wndproc(Arena *, Wndproc5, void *arg);
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our window procedure now gets a fifth argument with the program state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;LRESULT my_wndproc(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM, void *arg)
{
    MyState *state = arg;
    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When registering the class we wrap it in a trampoline compatible with &lt;code&gt;RegisterClass&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    RegisterClassA(&amp;amp;(WNDCLASSA){
        // ...
        .lpfnWndProc   = make_wndproc(a, my_wndproc, state),
        .lpszClassName = "my_class",
        // ...
    });
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All windows using this class will readily have access to this state object through their fifth parameter. It turns out setting up &lt;code&gt;exebuf&lt;/code&gt; was the
more complicated part, and &lt;code&gt;make_wndproc&lt;/code&gt; is quite simple!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;WNDPROC make_wndproc(Arena *a, Wndproc5 proc, void *arg)
{
    Str thunk = S(
        "\x48\x83\xec\x28"      // sub   $40, %rsp
        "\x48\xb8........"      // movq  $arg, %rax
        "\x48\x89\x44\x24\x20"  // mov   %rax, 32(%rsp)
        "\xe8...."              // call  proc
        "\x48\x83\xc4\x28"      // add   $40, %rsp
        "\xc3"                  // ret
    );
    Str r   = clone(a, thunk);
    int rel = (int)((uintptr_t)proc - (uintptr_t)(r.data + 24));
    memcpy(r.data+ 6, &amp;amp;arg, sizeof(arg));
    memcpy(r.data+20, &amp;amp;rel, sizeof(rel));
    return (WNDPROC)r.data;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assembly allocates a new stack frame, with callee shadow space, and with room for the new argument, which also happens to re-align the stack. It stores the new argument for the &lt;code&gt;Wndproc5&lt;/code&gt; just above the shadow space.
Then calls into the &lt;code&gt;Wndproc5&lt;/code&gt; without touching other parameters. There
are two “patches” to fill out, which I’ve initially filled with dots: the
context pointer itself, and a 32-bit signed relative address for the call.
It’s going to be very near the callee. The only thing I don’t like about
this function is that I’ve manually worked out the patch offsets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s probably not useful, but it’s easy to update the context pointer at any time if hold onto the trampoline pointer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;void set_wndproc_arg(WNDPROC p, void *arg)
{
    memcpy((char *)p+6, &amp;amp;arg, sizeof(arg));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    MyState *state[2] = ...;  // multiple states
    WNDPROC proc = make_wndproc(a, my_wndproc, state[0]);
    // ...
    set_wndproc_arg(proc, state[1]);  // switch states
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I expect the most common case is just creating multiple procedures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    WNDPROC procs[] = {
        make_wndproc(a, my_wndproc, state[0]),
        make_wndproc(a, my_wndproc, state[1]),
    };
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To my slight surprise these trampolines still work with an active Control Flow Guard system policy. Trampolines do not have stack unwind entries, and I thought Windows might refuse to pass control to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a complete, runnable example if you’d like to try it yourself: &lt;code&gt;main.c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exebuf.s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Better cases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is more work than going through &lt;code&gt;GWLP_USERDATA&lt;/code&gt;, and real programs
have a small, fixed number of window procedures — typically one — so this
isn’t the best example, but I wanted to illustrate with a real interface.
Again, perhaps the best real use is a library with a weak custom allocator
interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;typedef struct {
    void *(*malloc)(size_t);   // no context pointer!
    void  (*free)(void *);     // "
} Allocator;

void *arena_malloc(size_t, Arena *);

// ...

    Allocator perm_allocator = {
        .malloc = make_trampoline(exearena, arena_malloc, perm);
        .free   = noop_free,
    };
    Allocator scratch_allocator = {
        .malloc = make_trampoline(exearena, arena_malloc, scratch);
        .free   = noop_free,
    };
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something to keep in my back pocket for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

It is the latest in the line of development known as "dictionary APL". The spelling scheme uses the ASCII alphabet. The underlying concepts, such as arrays, verbs, adverbs, and rank, are extensions and generalizations of ideas in APL\360. Anomalies have been removed. The result is at once simpler and more powerful than previous dialects.&lt;p&gt;Ex ungue leonem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0. Introduction&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;6.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Free Software Awards winners announced: Andy Wingo, Alx Sa, Govdirectory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year's Free Software Awards recipients are Andy Wingo, Alx Sa, and Govdirectory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andy Wingo is the winner of the Award for the Advancement of Free Software, which is given to an individual who has made a great contribution to the progress and development of free software through activities in accordance with the spirit of software freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andy is one of the co-maintainers of GNU Guile, the official extension language of the GNU operating system and the Scheme "backbone" of GNU Guix. Upon receiving the award, he stated: "Since I learned about free software, the vision of a world in which hackers freely share and build on each others' work has been a profound inspiration to me, and I am humbled by this recognition of my small efforts in the context of the Guile Scheme implementation. I thank my co-maintainer, Ludovic Courtès, for his comradery over the years: we are just building on the work of the past maintainers of Guile, and I hope that we live long enough to congratulate its many future maintainers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2024 Award for Outstanding New Free Software Contributor went to Alx Sa for work on the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). When asked to comment, Alx responded: "I am honored to receive this recognition! I started contributing to the GNU Image Manipulation Program as a way to return the favor because of all the cool things it's allowed me to do. Thanks to the help and mentorship of amazing people like Jehan Pagès, Jacob Boerema, Liam Quin, and so many others, I hope I've been able to help other people do some cool new things, too."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Govdirectory was presented with this year's Award for Projects of Social Benefit, given to a project or team responsible for applying free software, or the ideas of the free software movement, to intentionally and significantly benefit society. Govdirectory provides a collaborative and fact-checked listing of government addresses, phone numbers, websites, and social media accounts, all of which can be viewed with free software and under a free license, allowing people to always reach their representatives in freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked to comment on their receipt of the award, Govdirectory co-founders Jan Ainali and Albin Larsson stated: "We are honored by this recognition and are deeply humbled to be among previous winners, some of whom we depend on, especially since we feel like a young project with many more important features to add and coverage to increase before we cover all of the world. For us in Govdirectory, even though the platform itself is not primarily intended for reuse, the four freedoms are part of our ethos as we see ourselves as a small corner of the community. In times like these with a lot of mis- and disinformation, our credibility is dependent on being able to build trust, and on anyone having the freedom to inspect how the platform is built and where the data is coming from."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FSF plans to further highlight the Free Software Award winners in a series of events scheduled for the new year to celebrate their contributions to free software. More information will be coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;If a Meta AI model can read a brain-wide signal, why wouldn’t the brain?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you know migratory birds and sea turtles are able to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field? It's called magnetoreception. Basically, being able to navigate was evolutionarily advantageous, so life evolved ways to feel the Earth's magnetic field. A LOT of ways. Like a shocking amount of ways. Here's a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Magnetotactic bacteria – magnetite chains as built-in compass needles.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Land plants – growth, germination, tropisms modulated by weak magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Honey bee – abdomen magnetite and magnetic compass in foragers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;American cockroach – behavior disrupted by specific RF fields, consistent with a magnetic sense.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fruit fly – cryptochrome-dependent magnetic compass under blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monarch butterfly – time-compensated magnetic compass for migration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Loggerhead sea turtle – hatchlings orient in coil-manipulated magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Common carp – spontaneous north–south body alignment in ponds.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sharks and rays – ampullae of Lorenzini detect electric and magnetic fields for navigation and prey detection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tadpoles – magnetically driven orientation tied to visual system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Box turtle – homing disrupted when local geomagnetic field is altered.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Domestic chicken – chicks trained to find social reward using a magnetic compass.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Homing pigeon – altered magnetic fields at the head deflect homing bearings.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Blind mole-rat – subterranean mammal with light-independent magnetic compass and map.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cattle and deer – grazing/herd bodies align roughly north–south at global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Domestic dogs – defecation posture tracks geomagnetic north–south under quiet field conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Humans – alpha-band EEG shows robust, orientation-specific responses to Earth-strength field rotations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would seem evolution adores detecting magnetic fields. And it makes sense! A literal "sense of direction" is quite useful in staying alive - nearly all life benefits from it, including us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't totally understand how our magnetoreception works yet, but we know that it does. In 2019, some Caltech researchers put some people in a room shielded from the Earth's magnetic field, with a big magnetic field generator in it. They hooked them up to an EEG, and watched what happened in their brains as they manipulated the magnetic field. The result: some of those people showed a response to the magnetic fields on the EEG!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That gets my noggin joggin. Our brain responds to magnetic field changes, but we aren't aware of it? What if it affects our mood? Would you believe me if I told you lunar gravity influences the Earth's magnetosphere? Perhaps I was too dismissive of astrology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But seriously&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Biomagnetism is "the phenomenon of magnetic fields produced by living organisms". Hold up. Produced by? I made another list for you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Weakly electric fish – electric organs generate pulsed currents whose surrounding magnetic fields (nanotesla scale) have been recorded directly near the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Earthworms – single action potentials in the giant axon system produce biomagnetic fields detectable with magnetic resonance spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Crayfish – the giant axon’s action currents generate ~10⁻¹⁰–10⁻⁹ T fields measured directly with toroidal pickup coils.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Frogs – action potentials in the sciatic nerve produce pico– to 10⁻¹⁰ T magnetic fields, recorded non-invasively with SQUIDs and optical magnetometers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Guinea pigs – isolated guinea-pig hearts generate magnetocardiograms; their heartbeat fields (tens of picotesla) are recorded with optically pumped magnetometers.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cats – neuromagnetic fields from the auditory cortex of domestic cats are measured with magnetoencephalography.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monkeys – cortical responses to tactile and auditory stimuli in macaque monkeys are mapped by measuring their brain’s magnetic fields with MEG.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rabbits – SQUID magnetometry outside the skull of anesthetized rabbits detects magnetic signatures of spreading cortical depolarization.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Humans – multiple biomagnetic signals are routinely measured: heart fields (magnetocardiography), brain fields (magnetoencephalography), skeletal-muscle fields (magnetomyography) and peripheral-nerve fields (magnetoneurography).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, right. We run on electricity, so we generate magnetic fields. Makes sense. But wait. We can detect magnetic fields AND we produce them? That's...hmm. Interesting. Let's read about magnetoencephalography (insane word).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's not the interesting thing about MEG. The interesting thing about MEG is that researchers at Meta, using MEG, were able to decode the brains magnetic fields into actual images and words. Who else forgot we successfully read people's minds in 2023? I know I did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how it worked: they trained models on public MEG datasets, and then used those models to decode the thoughts of study participants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In their words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Overall, our results show that MEG can be used to decipher, with millisecond precision, the rise of complex representations generated in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read this back when it happened, but then I read it again the other day and it struck me that it's actually an insane line of research. Like, we can train a model to understand the information that underlies human brain waves. They were able to translate brain activity, from the magnetic field alone, into images and text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So our brain's magnetic field is like a constant (with millisecond precision) readout of the current state of our brain? That's...HUH?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, okay. Research has established that humans can sense magnetic fields, and Meta was able to show that our own brain's magnetic field represents a high-enough-fidelity-to-read-data analog representation of our current "state" of mind. To such an extent that we've been able to decode it across many different brains, despite barely understanding it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, couldn't our own brain be reading it's own field? I mean, what are the chances evolution wouldn't take advantage of an available wireless summary of the global state of the brain? Wouldn't that answer the binding problem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;They're minerals, Marie!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question becomes how does the brain read the field? Well, let's go back to magnetoreception for a minute. How does that work again?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Magnetite biomineralization is a genetically-controlled biochemical process through which organisms make perfect ferrimagnetic crystals, usually of single magnetic domain size. This process is an ancient one, having evolved about 2 billion years ago in the magnetotactic bacteria, and presumably was incorporated in the genome of higher organisms, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our brains manufacture ferrimagnetic crystals. Table stakes. Established science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But let's not get too excited. The Earth's magnetic field is quite strong. In fact it's 50 to 500 MILLION times stronger than the brain's magnetic field. So these magnets could detect the Earth's magnetic field for sure, but could they detect the brain's own much weaker fields?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm here to tell you: hell yeah they could. Those ferrimagnetic crystals created by our brains tend to be in a tight size range that could resonate with and potentially modulate the specific spectrum of known neural oscillations (A.K.A. brain waves). This "stochastic resonance", which is mathematically possible in the brain, would allow for these tiny crystals to locally overcome the Earth's magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The brain's magnetic field can be read to extract the actual high-fidelity thoughts a person is having&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The brain creates magnetic crystals that just so happen to be the perfect size to interact with it's own magnetic field&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feels like we're getting somewhere. Let's pull the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everything is computer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If those crystals can read the brain's magnetic field, they can also certainly write to it. The brain's hardwiring/neurochemistry could manipulate the crystals much more easily than the magnetic field could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, using those biological magnets, could the brain...self-tune itself?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me zoom out. Here's how I'm thinking about it: the magnetic field seems to represent a current "state" of your thoughts. Nature loves analog systems. What if the brain used it's own magnetic field as a sort of analog compression of all of the underlying information? It definitionally represents the the sum total of all of the electrical activity in the neurons in the brain. It's as low-latency as it gets, limited only by the speed of light. We know our thoughts are encoded within it. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's imagine how this might work. We have this global state vehicle, we can read it with magnetic crystals, but how do we complete the loop? There would need to be some global write system, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The blue spot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC) (latin for "blue spot") is a tiny but obscenely important little part of our brain. It synthesizes "norepinephrine, which is a chemical that changes how alert, focused, and "plastic" (malleable) your brain is. I'll quote the Wiki:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The projections of this nucleus reach far and wide. For example, they innervate the spinal cord, the brain stem, cerebellum, hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the thalamic relay nuclei, the amygdala, the basal telencephalon, and the cortex. The norepinephrine from the LC has an excitatory effect on most of the brain, mediating arousal and priming the brain's neurons to be activated by stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The page continues to list all of the functions the LC-NA system is known to influence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arousal and sleep-wake cycle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attention and memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Behavioral and cognitive flexibility, creativity, personality, behavioral inhibition, and stress&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cognitive control&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decision making and utility maximization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emotions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Neuroplasticity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Posture and balance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global model failure where predictions about the world are strongly violated&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sure sounds like a global write system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did I mention it's located at the center of the brain?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compacting...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's summarize again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The brain's magnetic field can be read to extract the actual high-fidelity thoughts a person is having&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The brain creates magnetic crystals that just so happen to be the perfect size to interact with it's own magnetic field&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The brain has a single system that can, in response to stimuli, release a chemical that changes how the rest of the brain responds to stimuli&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let's make this a causal loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The brain creates a structured magnetic field pattern&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Magnetic crystals, in reaction to that pattern, trigger neurons to send signals (some to the LC-NA system)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Based on the data the LC receives (danger, reward, big decision), it fires a burst of norepinephrine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;That norephinephrine globally changes brain neurochemistry, which changes how magnetic crystals react to the magnetic field&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brain could then use that process to heavily optimize itself locally based on global state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The easier-than-expected problem of consciousness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So hold on, if the "brain computer" uses a lossy summary of all neuron activity to make decisions, doesn't that kind of sound familiar? Isn't a "lossy summary of all neuron activity" kind of equivalent to...what it feels like to be conscious?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like, basically the brain is a computer, but imagine it has to compress all of this data into one dimension. "Feeling like" something is a compression artifact - it's a lossy representation of all of the underlying data. So, we're computers, but it feels like this to be a computer because of the way the data is compressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"What it feels like" to be conscious is the inevitable end result of...extremely optimized data compression. Incredible. Evolution is an unmatched engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Air pollution may be more serious than we realize&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The magnetic crystals created by our brains are not the only ones we've found in there. Among the perfectly shaped and sized biogenic crystals are pollution-derived magnetic particles of many shapes and sizes that are prolific in urban, airborne particulate matter. We breathe this in through the nose, and it enters the brain directly through the olfactory nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, remember how the natural magnetic crystals are a very specific size and shape that allows them to resonate with the brain's magnetic field and ultimately overcome the Earth's magnetic field. Above a certain volume, pollution-derived particles would significantly change the math in that system, and could very easily impact the ability for the brain's magnetic field to interact with it's own natural magnetic crystals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, there should be evidence of a system breakdown among people who breathe enough sufficiently polluted air. We would see a breakdown of ability to learn - significant issues with memory. It would build up over time and it's progression would be slow at first. The locus coeruleus in particular would become less active as the brain lost the ability to send signals to "self-tune" itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Air pollution has been significantly correlated with Alzheimer's disease. They've even recently demonstrated evidence of causation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And critically, where have we (inexplicably thus far) seen some of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's pathology?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you found this interesting, I put together a whitepaper with a lot more digging on the Alzheimer's theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mathlib is a user maintained library for the Lean theorem prover. It contains both programming infrastructure and mathematics, as well as tactics that use the former and allow to develop the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find detailed instructions to install Lean, mathlib, and supporting tools on our website. Alternatively, click on one of the buttons below to open a GitHub Codespace or a Gitpod workspace containing the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please refer to https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/wiki/Using-mathlib4-as-a-dependency&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got everything installed? Why not start with the tutorial project?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more pointers, see Learning Lean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the installation guides above and Lean's general documentation, the documentation of mathlib consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The mathlib4 docs: documentation generated automatically from the source &lt;code&gt;.lean&lt;/code&gt;files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A description of currently covered theories, as well as an overview for mathematicians.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some extra Lean documentation not specific to mathlib (see "Miscellaneous topics")&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Documentation for people who would like to contribute to mathlib&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion surrounding mathlib occurs in a Zulip chat room, and you are welcome to join, or read along without signing up. Questions from users at all levels of expertise are welcome! We also provide an archive of the public discussions, which is useful for quick reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complete documentation for contributing to &lt;code&gt;mathlib&lt;/code&gt; is located
on the community guide contribute to mathlib&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may want to subscribe to the &lt;code&gt;mathlib4&lt;/code&gt; channel on Zulip to introduce yourself and your plan to the community.
Often you can find community members willing to help you get started and advise you on the fit and
feasibility of your project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;To obtain precompiled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;olean&lt;/code&gt;files, run&lt;code&gt;lake exe cache get&lt;/code&gt;. (Skipping this step means the next step will be very slow.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mathlib4&lt;/code&gt;run&lt;code&gt;lake build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build and run all tests, run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lake test&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;lake build Mathlib.Import.Path&lt;/code&gt;to build a particular file, e.g.&lt;code&gt;lake build Mathlib.Algebra.Group.Defs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you added a new file, run the following command to update&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Mathlib.lean&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;lake exe mk_all&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathlib has the following guidelines and conventions that must be followed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The style guide&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A guide on the naming convention&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The documentation style&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run &lt;code&gt;lake exe cache get&lt;/code&gt; to download cached build files that are computed by &lt;code&gt;mathlib4&lt;/code&gt;'s automated workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If something goes mysteriously wrong, you can try one of &lt;code&gt;lake clean&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rm -rf .lake&lt;/code&gt; before trying &lt;code&gt;lake exe cache get&lt;/code&gt; again.
In some circumstances you might try &lt;code&gt;lake exe cache get!&lt;/code&gt;
which re-downloads cached build files even if they are available locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call &lt;code&gt;lake exe cache&lt;/code&gt; to see its help menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mathlib4_docs repository is responsible for generating and publishing the mathlib4 docs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That repo can be used to build the docs locally:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4_docs.git
cd mathlib4_docs
cp ../mathlib4/lean-toolchain .
lake exe cache get
lake build Mathlib:docs&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last step may take a while (&amp;gt;20 minutes). The HTML files can then be found in &lt;code&gt;.lake/build/doc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For users familiar with Lean 3 who want to get up to speed in Lean 4 and migrate their existing Lean 3 code we have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A survival guide for Lean 3 users&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instructions to run &lt;code&gt;mathport&lt;/code&gt;on a project other than mathlib.&lt;code&gt;mathport&lt;/code&gt;is the tool the community used to port the entirety of&lt;code&gt;mathlib&lt;/code&gt;from Lean 3 to Lean 4.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a mathlib contributor and want to update dependencies, use &lt;code&gt;lake update&lt;/code&gt;,
or &lt;code&gt;lake update batteries aesop&lt;/code&gt; (or similar) to update a subset of the dependencies.
This will update the &lt;code&gt;lake-manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; file correctly.
You will need to make a PR after committing the changes to this file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please do not run &lt;code&gt;lake update -Kdoc=on&lt;/code&gt; as previously advised, as the documentation related
dependencies should only be included when CI is building documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You’re Good&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A few, for sure.”&lt;lb/&gt;“About four times, actually. And my family’s rather small.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Suicide has impacted my old friend group quite a bit.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I’ve lost friends. I’ve lost family.”&lt;lb/&gt;“My older brother.”&lt;lb/&gt;“My sister’s youngest.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I never thought I’d have that many people.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Alcohol and depression, it comes hand-in-hand.”&lt;lb/&gt;“One day the smiles stopped.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I don’t mind talking about it.”&lt;lb/&gt;“You guys are actually talking to the right person.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m interviewing fellow Indigenous metalheads at a heavy music festival on the Blackfeet Nation, with Russel Daniels (Diné and Ho-Chunk descent), a photographer who’s not into metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Plenty of times.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I had attempted two times.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Growing up here, you could feel very isolated.”&lt;lb/&gt;“The truth is I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Everywhere I went I just didn’t feel like I had enough of me in me.”&lt;lb/&gt;“It’s a battle, for sure. Sometimes it’s a little voice in the back of your ear.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I’ve looked at a full prescription of pills I had, and I’m just like, ‘just this, and it can all just be …’”&lt;lb/&gt;“But I never went through with it, cause I’m still here!”&lt;lb/&gt;Some of them are young. High schoolers, even. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The idea came close here and there, but I had my own outlets to manage my emotions.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Music. Going to shows. Keeping my hands busy.”&lt;lb/&gt;“After those two times, it really was music.”&lt;lb/&gt;“My son, really. There’s a lot of love around me.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I didn’t want my mom to lose another kid.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I don’t want my niece or my nephew, or even my mother, walking in and finding me there.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Seeing how other people push on. Being one of the people that other people see pushing on.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Skateboarding, when I was younger, which is kind of why I got into heavy metal. Listening to my uncle’s Metallica CDs.”&lt;lb/&gt;“I just get over it by listening to metal.”&lt;lb/&gt;“Throw on some metal and you’re good.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Buffalo Hide Academy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The school year was almost past, and a hot May afternoon lorded over Browning, Montana, capital of the Blackfeet Nation. Grinning rez dogs with patchy coats rested in the sidewalk shade outside an alternative public high school called Buffalo Hide Academy, where lunch was ending. Students ambled into a warehouse-sized classroom with a podium and some tables at the far end, and musical instruments in a corner by the teacher’s office. Student artwork and a Blackfeet Nation flag bedecked the walls alongside a mural of a buffalo skull and the school’s name in dripping red letters. The kids didn’t sit in rows or take out homework; nobody checked whether they were on time. They shuffled around in grubby Converse, joking with each other at full volume. Some picked up instruments and started jamming with their teacher, Robert Hall (Piikunii), who was already messing around on the drum kit. It got loud, fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I would describe Browning as metal,” Hall told me, seated at the drums in a luau shirt and bushy black ponytail, his ferocious brown eyes the size of jawbreakers. “We don’t turn away from the darkness,” he said. “We don’t hide our own ugliness, the way that people in big cities could hide.” The town is rough, even by rez standards. “There’s buildings that have been standing just in a void. No humans, no life running through these buildings for years,” Hall explained. “But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another teacher, Charlie Speicher, warmed up the mic. “Who likes chaotic mathcore?” he tried, referring to a rhythmically unpredictable subgenre of hardcore punk that he describes as “bonkers” and “all over the place.” Two hands went up. One was mine. “That makes three of us,” said Speicher as he pulled up a YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The students were finishing the inaugural year of Buffalo Hide Academy’s semester-long, two-hour heavy music symposium dedicated to the study of metal and hardcore. Speicher, who’s non-Native, is a clinical counselor and also Buffalo Hide Academy’s director. The symposium was his brainchild. He and other teachers hand-picked students who looked like they might be isolated, or might be into darker, more aggressive art and music — kids who might be potential metalheads. More than fifty students initially enrolled. By the end of the first semester, kids were sneaking out of other classes to join.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speicher teaches in his “battle vest,” a staple of metal fashion that’s usually denim hand-studded with metal pyramids or spikes, and stitched with patches showing band logos in barbed, rootlike scripts impossible for the uninitiated to decipher. In addition to providing a feeling of physical protection, battle vests are threshold guardians that intimidate normies while signalling to dedicated fans who recognize the glyphs. If you know, you know — and you’re family. If not, fuck off. But Speicher is here to welcome kids into the fold, where a community of music fans understands their suffering. Or, as he put it later, “to create more safety and protection specifically from suicidal distress,” which he said has impacted every family in Browning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some in Browning think he’s doing the devil’s work, but Speicher is as warm and approachable as a cool youth pastor, speaking gently and smiling easily through a handsome swath of stubble. His vest is emblazoned with the gaunt face from Converge’s 2001 album Jane Doe. He showed the kids the music video to “Farewell, Mona Lisa” by mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. It sometimes sounds like Dick Van Dyke’s fancy footwork flawlessly executing a trip and stumble. “Goes hard, huh? What’d you see? What’d you hear?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s precise and complicated, students said. The guitars and drums are in conversation, mirroring each other. The drumming starts like black metal blast beats but switches into a groove. Rough vocals alternate with intelligible singing. Guitars are in standard tuning, not drop-tuning like most metal. The fashion is different from metal too – less theatrical. One student noted the singer’s contorted body language: “He’s feeling his emotions while he’s letting the art out of him.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Mmm, beautiful,” Speicher said. Later, students looked at landscape photos and guessed which heavy genre or subgenre they represented: a frozen forest for black metal; a crumbling alley for doom; an urban protest for hardcore; an alligator swamp for death metal. They discussed “geographic determinism,” the theory that music is shaped partly by its place of origin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“But there’s immense beauty here, too — extreme beauty. Our murals, our family networks, our ancient history, our language, the things that are binding us together for thousands of generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Speicher wasn’t just there to nerd out. He shifted seamlessly into an overview of heavy music’s therapeutic benefits: catharsis, community and coping skills. “Heavy music teaches us things such as we’re not alone; when life is dark, we do something about it. We’re not just a prisoner to that darkness. But also that our risk fluctuates, that our misery isn’t gonna last forever. There are ways through it.” Students doodled in notebooks, idly plucked at an unplugged bass guitar, or held hands under the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A history lesson from another teacher on the ’80s and ’90s Scandinavian origins of black metal — including its problematic elements, like murder and Nazism among some bands — served as a caution to consume media critically. While hardcore is overtly political and tends hard left, the morality of metal is murkier, oriented primarily around pushing extremes and attacking social norms. Results can be chaotic. This segued into a high-level, student-led conversation about whether and when to separate art from artist. In another lesson, Speicher said, they’d studied the Vietnam War through the lens of Black Sabbath, whose 1970 staple “War Pigs” critiqued American involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Your homework tonight, and I’ll remind you of this later, go listen to the song ‘43% Burnt.’” Speicher told students to pay special attention to an influential breakdown at the end. They broke off to paint each other’s faces in “corpse paint,” and take album cover-style photos with animal skulls and hides. Emily Edwards (Piikunii), an almost-15-year-old, schooled me on Swedish rock. “You don’t know Ghost?” she said. Inspired by the class, Edwards and some friends had started their own band, Crimson Harmony. Edwards was one of many students who signed up for a paid internship at an upcoming metal festival called Fire in the Mountains coming to Blackfeet Nation later that summer. Festival internships were part of why teachers started the symposium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Rink (Piikunii), who teaches Blackfeet studies and language, pulled me aside, brimming with excitement. He was painting the skull of a buffalo the students helped process. Across its brow he’d painted overlapping bear paws, mother and cub, in flame colors. He dotted them with pinprick white stars — Ursa Major and Minor, which he said both Piikunii and European traditions recognize as bears. The skull was a gift for Norwegian festival headliners Wardruna, whose latest album, Birna, was named in honor of the bear. Rink had aligned the painted stars to match the position the real stars would take when Wardruna performed beneath them in Blackfeet Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Firekeepers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AS COVID ARRIVED IN 2020, a string of suicides ripped through the Blackfeet Nation, claiming multiple kids per year, some as young as 11. Speicher said it hit the entire community “like a sledgehammer.” He called up a fourth grade teacher in Rathdrum, Idaho, named Steve Von Till, whom metalheads might recognize as a doomy poet-troubadour and the former Neurosis guitarist. Speicher, Hall, Rink, Von Till and a few others banded together to help their students stay alive, as if building a protective fire to shelter them in the darkness. They called themselves the Firekeeper Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years earlier, the crunchy-pagan festival Fire in the Mountains was priced out of gentrifying Jackson, Wyoming. Speicher spoke to its owners about bringing the festival to the rez. He planned to build internships into his class to connect kids with career pathways in an industry of like-minded people. It sounded perfect. But first they needed buy-in from tribal council.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council has long supported youth through athletics, especially running and basketball. Dipping into the arts, specifically music — to say nothing of metal — would be new territory. But Councilman Everett Armstrong told me that because it was for the kids, they considered it. “Let’s try to go a different route to give our youth something that they can open our minds to, open our hearts to, find themselves,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could help the nation economically, too, Armstrong said. The reservation lies along the imaginary line splitting Piikunii homelands into the colonial annex called Glacier National Park. The park is an over-half-billion-dollar industry. But many Piikunii people, Armstrong said, live in poverty. It’s one of the factors contributing to the widespread suicidal distress that disproportionately harms Native communities. When I told folks I was going to Blackfeet Nation, most didn’t know where that was, until I mentioned Glacier. The monied Glacier Park Lodge had a gift shop peddling Glacier mementos — but, despite being on the reservation, offered nothing I could take home that says “Blackfeet Nation.” “We need to try to tap into that and try to get some revenue back into the Blackfeet Reservation,” Armstrong said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the festival to work, they needed bands big enough to draw fans to the rez. So in August 2024, the Firekeepers flew to Boulder, Colorado, to court pagan folk band Wardruna, whose world tour was starting at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Speicher and the gang wanted to meet in person and convince them to play Blackfeet Nation. It’s for the children, they would say. Norwegian and Piikunii cultures share traditions of animism. The Firekeepers brought sweet pine ties, used for smudging, as gifts, and met Wardruna at the C.U. Boulder library. They didn’t know the band was already sold on the idea. Singer Einar Selvik had spoken to Speicher on the phone, and they were ready to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert,” Selvik told me, “all the pieces just fit so well together.” It was a major get for the festival. Rink said they stayed up all night talking about it. Their vision and the Nordic stars had aligned. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dance Intertribal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LATE JULY: AMTRAK UNLOADED A GAGGLE OF BLACK DENIM and bandanna-clad metalheads onto the small, sunny platform at East Glacier Park, Montana, a tiny seasonal town 15 minutes outside Browning. Two days earlier, Ozzy Osbourne, the grandfather of metal and lead singer of Black Sabbath, had died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it was the festival’s first time on a reservation, nobody knew what to expect. Festivals, after all, can go very badly, and no one wanted to remember this as “Fyre” in the Mountains. But good omens greeted us. Our Lord and Savior Ozzy must have parted the week’s rainy spell for a few days of perfect festival weather: high 70s, partly cloudy, cool after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Firekeeper Alliance distributed tickets to the local community, and invited Blackfoot attendees from Canada. Others road tripped in, or flew into Kalispell, around 2,400 fans — a third of them Natives, Speicher and Rink estimated — converging from across the continent for three days and 23 bands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the festival grounds, the party opened not with a land acknowledgement but a welcome from the land’s actual Indigenous people. In proper Native fashion, they held a grand entry, and true to form, it started late. “We’re runnin’ on Indian time!” shouted Hall through a megaphone, war-whooping and half-dangling from the back of a motorcycle that Speicher peeled across the rugged ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the crew finished setting up a stage in the distance, hundreds of metalheads sat watching in a circle while Piikunii locals in regalia danced fancy, traditional, chicken, jingle and grass. Young Grey Horse hammered the drum and Hall let his rowdy demeanor emcee, throwing out Charlie Hill jokes to keep the mood light. For many, it was a transformative moment. Some fans had never been to a powwow and were encountering Indigenous culture for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, Hall called for an intertribal — an all-inclusive dance. The metalheads hesitated, but after a few courageous outliers broke onto the grass, others followed, bouncing a circle in their battle vests and black jeans, like a respectful, slow-motion mosh pit, as they awkwardly tried to two-step like the pros. A showboating school-aged fancy dancer twirled past them in her shawl, rapid-fire footwork leaving them in the dust. But the dance was a welcome, not a competition. Hearts were opening. People cheered, Natives and non-Natives together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Selvik, the powwow was a powerful way “to set the tone, to open the circle.” This festival required some vulnerability of attendees, some deference. We were guests on Piikunii lands. There would be no alcohol — a marked adjustment for metal culture. It would be, as Hall declared, “a cultural exchange between the Piikunii and metalheads.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fringe Culture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“ON MY RESERVATION, PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO TWO THINGS: rap or hip-hop,” joked Logan Mason (Colville), who traveled from Spokane and volunteered with the camping crew in exchange for festival admission. Mason lost his brother and nephew to suicide, and metal helped him work through depression in his late teens and early 20s. “Growing up, I did not know anybody else that listened to black metal or death metal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On other reservations, it’s different. The Navajo Nation, for example, has a genre-defining “rez metal” scene. Some folks joke that you’re either a hip-hop Native or a metal Native. If anything, Natives seem over-represented in the metal community. “A lot of it is land-based,” said Meg Skyum (Oji-Cree), who’d come to the festival from Ontario to see the Native black metal outfit Blackbraid and get a sneak preview of their third album. Atmospheric black metal in particular is “about the fucking trees and shit,” which Natives appreciate. Plus, Natives and metalheads, Skyum added, both live in the margins of ordinary society. “We’re fringe, they’re fringe.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“A chance to stand with (the) Indigenous in a constructive, powerful way, and a chance to visit a beautiful place and to do something that is more than just a festival, more than just a concert.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The metal tribe itself seems to attract a lot of people that go through different types of struggle,” said Tomas Falomir (Ojibwe, Hopi and Zuni Pueblo descent) from Parker, Colorado, noting that the music is healing, the community welcoming. “Any type of person could be included.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also something about the sound, Falomir added. “It almost goes with the loudness, and even down to the beat of it.” Other fans agreed. The thundering drums and powerful vocals resemble a modernized version of Native music, one said. Pomona-based Indigenous death/doom project Tzompantli would later exemplify this, shaking the festival grounds with stomping downtempos from a battalion of traditional and contemporary drums. And European bands like Wardruna, fans noted, are really, really into their cultures, especially pre-Christian traditions, just like Natives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma,” said Damien Jones Jr. (Diné), who traveled with family from Lukachukai in Navajo Nation, and brought one of the festival’s most-photographed battle vests, decked out with turquoise geometrics and a “Frybread Power” backpatch. Jones plays saxophone — classical and jazz. “That’s what I do as well, throw all my feelings and emotions into music.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dark Horse, Ride&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“WELCOME TO THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD,” read the sign at Red Eagle Campground, where the Rockies arched like the knobby vertebrae of a sleeping Elder God half-buried in sediment. Across glassy Two Medicine Lake an amphitheater of pines presided like a chorus between the water line and a low timberline. On the near bank, a footpath wound along the edge of the lake, opening to beach access here and there with pop-up canopies and scatterings of hay-bale seats for workshops and panels on Indigenous sovereignty, ethnobotany, the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people, and the therapeutic effects of heavy music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cluster of interconnected meadows transformed into parking lots, a village of glamping yurts, a small bazaar of vendor tents, and the “stage bowl”: a shallow glen with two stages set up between tipis serving as green rooms. Curtains of savory smoke stoked saliva as Montana “off-grid catering” team Region Sauvage barbecued ducks and student-processed buffalo. High school interns decorated the stages with skulls, antlers, driftwood, witchy-Indigenous pieces of the forest. Edwards worked the merch tent, hawking Firekeeper Alliance shirts that showed a malevolent spirit of suicide haunting a tipi where Native kids sheltered around a fire. Proceeds supported suicide prevention. Shirts sold out the first day. Parking attendants and security all seemed suspiciously chill. It was intentional, they explained. Natives are used to being followed and scrutinized. Nobody wanted that atmosphere here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First on stage was Sage Bond (Diné and Nde), an up-and-coming acoustic metal singer-songwriter from Tonalea in Navajo Nation, who’d previously toured in support of suicide prevention efforts on her reservation. Bond matched the mountain sunshine with a low snarl a la Eddie Vedder, before breaking into a roar the size of 10 mountain lions — what she called “the Cookie Monster vocals.” Bond expected a sparse crowd drifting in and out, but her performance captivated hundreds. It was a big moment — her first time playing a festival that size, which she jokingly called a “black metal Coachella” (though the only feather headdresses were on tribal council members). “How the heck did they even find me?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out Bond was recommended by Chicago black metal artists Pan-Amerikan Native Front. During their set, they invited students onstage to headbang alongside the singer, Kurator of War, in black-and-white face paint and crossed bullet sashes. Other students held up a Blackfeet Nation flag and tossed their long hair next to barrel-chested guitarist Necroboar (Purépecha), who looked mean as hell in spiked leather cuffs, but later, backstage, was beaming. “A lot of people are thanking us for being here with the kids,” Necroboar said, “but it’s like you don’t understand what this means to us to be here and to see them.” He told me he and his bandmates saw themselves in the teenagers. Misty-eyed fans agreed, knowing they would remember this moment forever. The band had rehearsed their set that morning at Buffalo Hide Academy with the kids. They’d always wanted to play a rez. Being here was a dream come true. “I’m still shaking from it,” Necroboar said. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Musicians didn’t quarantine themselves. Many hung out with fans — riding horses, paddleboarding, doing yoga by the lake, attending workshops and panel discussions, or headbanging in the crowds. By the food stands selling frybread with huckleberry butter, metalheads set up a little table as an altar to Ozzy. It gathered river rocks, feathers, cigarettes, and trinkets. “Long Live the Prince of Darkness,” read a sign at the feet of a grinning Ozzy bobblehead and some candles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twenty-four weeks pregnant, Heather Jordan (Diné) delivered a scorching set in the sunshine with her masked drummer pummeling the kit behind her. Jordan is the singer and guitarist for Navajo Nation blackened doomgaze duo Liłith. She’d wanted to play Fire in the Mountains because favorites like Wolves in the Throne Room preceded her. And it helped that this year’s festival focused on “the Native side of things.” Jordan works a day job at a restaurant serving tourists on her own rez, which is also dry. “It’s like the hardest thing for them to understand,” she said. When Fire in the Mountains invited Liłith, their answer was “Hell, yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The festival’s spirituality attracted Jon Krieger of Blackbraid, a solo recording project that blew up overnight when his first single, “Barefoot Ghost Dance on Blood Soaked Soil,” got traction on YouTube in 2022. “All the black metal that’s the best in the world in my opinion comes from the heart,” Krieger said. Blackbraid was one of around five Native bands playing the festival, though Krieger, who was adopted, doesn’t know his tribal affiliation. Black metal is a spiritual genre, he said, and while it’s dominated by “Scandinavian dudes talking about old Norse religion and culture,” the values align. “Anti-Christianity is something that we share with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are into metal because of how much trauma that we go through in our daily lives. And not only in our own daily lives, but our historical trauma.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On stage later, beneath an array of a dozen stag skulls, Krieger was slinking around like a ghostly Indigenous Jim Morrison, windmilling his waist-length hair, blasting life force through a cedar flute and leaning over the crowd to shriek upward-arcing shards — whose strength never flagged during his entire blistering set — as his guitarist crowned his howls with constellations of tremolo picking. In the mosh pit, one fan hoisted a buffalo rib the size of a baseball bat, presumably from the barbecue, like some feral invocation. Blackbraid’s performance may have converted Daniels, the photographer, to solid metal fandom. But after Converge, he stood by me and said, “Now I get it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Converge was another get, one of Speicher’s favorites. Bassist Nate Newton had Zoomed into Speicher’s classroom to chat music with students. So had Ivar Bjørnson from Enslaved — A-listers, donating their time to Browning rez kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Converge played, Speicher and the other Firekeepers presented them with a buffalo skull painted with the iconic Jane Doe face. And they gifted the buffalo’s tongue, the most prized part of the animal, to tribal council.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mosh pit opened in the center of the crowd as soon as Converge blasted forth, the biggest and most fearsome pit yet. The chaos of bodies in conflict summoned a dust devil from the Earth into the sky. It might not look like it, but there’s a shared ethic at work, what Hall called “consensual fucking violence, man.” If you get a bloody nose, you can be proud. If you fall, fans pick you back up. We aren’t fighting. By bracing and colliding, we’re helping each other. The rush is purifying. The release, stabilizing. Jumping in, you might want to die, but when the pit spits you out, you’ll be beaming like Necroboar — happy to have survived the maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partway through Converge’s set, skinny, sleeve-tatted frontman Jacob Bannon passed the mic to a Piikunii youth, who seamlessly took over the chorus of “Dark Horse.”&lt;lb/&gt;We’ll show the demons&lt;lb/&gt;For what they are&lt;lb/&gt;Dark!&lt;lb/&gt;Horse!&lt;lb/&gt;Ride!&lt;lb/&gt;Towards the light! &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knew every shout and scream by heart, absolutely commanding the stage. The crowd was living for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Musicians understood the assignment and turned it up to 11, new blood and seasoned pros alike. As dusk settled, staff closed the lakeside trails, mindful of everyone’s safety, while Finnish folk metal band Hexvessel sang about people disappearing into the forests. After dark, fans gathered around a bonfire to ward off the chill. Wardruna took the stage and spread their haunting ambience to the woods’ inky edges. Someone dressed like a wizard slipped through the crowds as a human figure with antlers danced silhouetted before a glowing tipi. High above a membrane of diffuse gray, the bear stars slowly turned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Strange Road to Joy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A FULL MAP OF METAL’S SPRAWLING SUBGENRES is hard to pin down. But for what it’s worth, Wikipedia lists 34 subgenres and 16 sub-subgenres of metal, rivalled primarily by much broader genres like pop, rock, and opera, the latter which has 120 subgenres. Encyclopaedia Metallum lists 16 main subgenres, but sub-subgenres and combinations seem unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like opera, much of metal prioritizes the voice — though as an aesthetic inversion. Similar to Inuit throat singing, vocalizations are guttural and challenging to master. Like wine, metal adheres to a pedigree whose sense experience reflects a place of origin: Cascadian black metal, for instance, is hazy as the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest. And like European classical music, or jazz, metal ranges in style from ambient drone to bombastic spectacle to precise and unpredictable arrangements astonishing to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“We’ve all had periods of hurt. And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids. What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness — or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is “a strange road to joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve all had periods of hurt,” Kurator of War said, seated on a folding chair next to Von Till with singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe, Newton and Bjørnson. No makeup, no bullets. Behind them, morning clouds rippled like flags on the glacier-crisp pebble beds of Two Medicine Lake. “And this music was the medicine we didn’t know we needed until we’re in it.” A crowd of metalheads sat cross-legged on the grass, or perched on hay bales in the partial pine shade, listening to the panel. “I think we’re all curious. I think we’re all empathetic. I think we want to get to that other side of connection and knowledge.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speicher lobbed questions that prompted an intimate conversation about the healing power of heavy music, which at times drew tears — from fans and musicians. Von Till said heavy music is a way of “getting rid of the sickness,” which helps him become more sensitive and vulnerable. He also noted the importance of catharsis. “How many times has that moment of release prevented that one moment in a kid that can’t be retaken?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in Bjørnson’s life, he realized people had to be athletic or good looking for acceptance in some groups. “With the metal gang, the qualification was being into metal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not like this kind of stuff attracts normal people. Like we all — you’re weird. You’re all weird,” Newton said to ripples of laughter and cheers. “And it’s beautiful. We could be completely different but we have this one thing that we both understand: why we’re into it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s them that are weird,” Von Till parried. “We’re the normal ones, right? Fuck that.” More cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, Lord, Yeah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ON THE THIRD DAY, THE SKY RENT IN TWO. Just as the evening drained of color, the power went out — halfway through a set by Virginia headbangers Inter Arma. They didn’t stop. Only the drum kit was audible without amps and mics, but the drummer kept spirits rolling as the minutes wore on, stage hands scrambling to patch the glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Answers&lt;lb/&gt;Sage Bond &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Dying Breath of a Sacred Stag&lt;lb/&gt;Blackbraid &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Farewell, Mona Lisa&lt;lb/&gt;The Dillinger Escape Plan &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forest Service Road Blues&lt;lb/&gt;Inter Arma &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Birna&lt;lb/&gt;Warduna &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calling Down the Darkness&lt;lb/&gt;Steve Von Till &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rainbow in the Dark&lt;lb/&gt;Dio&lt;lb/&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Listen on Spotify&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparse raindrops descended upon the crowd, but nobody seemed to care. Then the familiar tick of a tempo rose from the drummer’s high hat cymbals. The crowd started laughing, cheering, singing. It was “War Pigs” — Sabbath. Colorful stage lights fired back up. When the metalheads sang “Oh, Lord, yeah!” the sneer of Ozzy’s voice carried like mist across the many, a phantom formed by hundreds of mouths in unison. Re-amped guitars picked up the lick to complete the collective homage. Piikunii highschoolers sieged the stage again, drumming powwow style alongside the band.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nigh had the crowd caught its breath when lightning flashed like a Catholic schoolteacher flicking the lights. Thunder murmured from the belly of the Rockies beyond a ridgeline that blurred into rolling gray. Another flash. Closer, noted Daniels, the photographer; maybe two second’s delay. Sparse droplets swelled to a downpour. The lightless heavens opened, the Prince of Darkness summoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is metal,” a festival staff member in a Day-Glo vest shouted to fans gathered under the merch tent. He wasn’t speaking metaphorically. The tent’s frame could draw lightning. “Shelter in your cars or tents!” he ordered. “Go, now! Now!” Metalheads scrambled for cover, evacuating in slick mud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daniels and I found ourselves with some new friends, ducking into the yurt of one of the musicians, Rebecca Vernon, founder of Salt Lake City doom-sludge band SubRosa, who now performs a solo piano project called The Keening. She invited us in, offered us snacks, made sure we were all safe and hydrated. We laughed together, Natives and non-Natives, prisoners of the darkness, speculating about whether Inter Arma had summoned the spirit of Grandfather Ozzy and he was messing with us from — wherever he was. We worried the next set might be canceled. It was one of the headliners, Old Man’s Child, a fan favorite that helped define the Norwegian black metal sound in the early days. In over 30 years, Old Man’s Child had never played in the United States. But they’d agreed to play Blackfeet Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Debuting in a setting like this adds depth to the moment,” singer Galder told the website Knotfest before the festival. “There’s something about the rawness and unpredictability of the natural world that mirrors what I try to capture in Old Man’s Child. The beauty in the darkness, the stillness before the storm, the feeling of something ancient just beneath the surface.” That ancient unpredictability may have just gotten the better of his grand North American debut. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A scream rang through the night. Or a shout? It was hard to understand, like metal vocals. I unzipped the door flap. The rain had stopped. The shouts rang clearer a second time: “Show’s back on!” We jammed our feet back into soggy shoes and boots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was fully nighttime when the storm’s misery passed. A string of fans with phone flashlights and headlamps meandered back down the muddy path and over a little footbridge, across a babbling brook to the clearing where the bonfire flared bright and warm between the stages, belching embers upward like some inverted underworld rain. From a distance, the returning metalheads looked like a serpent of stars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By firelight we danced with a Piikunii grandmother in a silk bandanna to Dio’s “Rainbow in the Dark,” euphoria setting in from the topsy-turvy snafu and the might of nature, which had banished all traces of late-festival fatigue. Then finally, riding in on the heels of the thunderstorm, Old Man’s Child took the stage. Galder, in corpse paint, dispatched legions of fog wraiths, strobe spectres galloping across a sea of electrified faces. A beautiful hell broke loose, exorcising our collective and personal demons. The festival — the ceremony — was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Our ancestors held ceremony together’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ON SOCIAL MEDIA, FANS WERE STUPID WITH ENTHUSIASM about the weekend: “Pure magic,” “transformational,” “profound,” “life changing.” They posted reports of unexpected tears and healing. One Instagram comment called it the “the most incredible metal festival I’ve been to, and it was my 3rd one this summer.” Others called it the best music festival they’d been to of any genre. Daniels, newly baptized, joined the chorus: “I have joined the cvlt.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t just the music. The consensus seemed to be that the lack of alcohol actually enhanced the experience. Frank Godla, co-founder of digital publication Metal Injection, said he learned more about Native people at this festival than he ever had from books or documentaries. Wardruna echoed the many in posting humble thanks to the Blackfeet Nation: “There are so many people out there in the world who deeply sympathize and stand with you and your ancestors in all your struggles. I am one of those people,” Salnik captioned a picture of himself on stage, proudly holding aloft the hand-painted buffalo skull. “It was like our ancestors held ceremony together and their meeting is rippling as we speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the learning was two-way: Tribal Chairman Rodney “Minnow” Gervais took the stage to remark on how kind and diverse the metalheads were, how clean they kept the grounds. “Be proud of yourselves,” he said. “What you see here is proof that music transcends religion, color, whatever you want. It brings us all together.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They look scary,” Councilman Armstrong told me about the metalheads, “but they’re some of the nicest people. They’re so welcoming.” People I spoke to in East Glacier agreed. Armstrong said tribal council is now considering branching into music events of other genres, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s heartwarming to have a full circle moment for me,” Mason, the fan from Spokane, said, seeing Native culture come together with the music he loves, in support of a cause close to his heart. “I was like damn, was this festival calling me?” After interning at the merch tent, Edwards said she might pick a different long-term job, but does see herself working in the music industry. And she wants to keep playing in a band when she is older, Crimson Harmony or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As stray metalheads sat around the grand foyer of Glacier Park Lodge, leaning on their backpacks or napping on the sofas, waiting for the evening train, a classical guitarist plucked out a polished-up version of the Led Zeppelin classic “Stairway to Heaven.” On the train back to the West Coast, the metalheads hung out as new friends. In the observation car, they shared weekend highlights, Natives and non-Natives together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A week later, I saw Von Till and Vernon again, this time in Portland, the last stop on Von Till’s summer tour before the new school year. We were still thinking about the festival. We tried to pin down what it was about Fire in the Mountains that still had us sobbing intermittently a week out. Von Till nailed it: “It made me dare to hope.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can You Imagine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If there’s a world where we don’t have to worry about suicide, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about bullying, that’s a world where we don’t have to worry about violence, about war.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I feel like that world wouldn’t work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You could try to picture it, but it never really fully comes into view.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I feel like it needs to be talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I like to daydream about that a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These are things I think about too much and I don’t have too many spaces to set them out of my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’d probably be a lot more people at the reservations, and more family and connection.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Those little subtle moments that we all share, of sitting next to the fireplace, or sharing a new book, making a new friend, all of that would still keep expanding in mysterious ways of goodness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everyone just being creative.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It looks probably a little bit like heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
