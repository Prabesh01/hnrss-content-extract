    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How Markdown took over the world&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly every bit of the high-tech world, from the most cutting-edge AI systems at the biggest companies, to the casual scraps of code cobbled together by college students, is annotated and described by the same, simple plain text format. Whether you’re trying to give complex instructions to ChatGPT, or you want to be able to exchange a grocery list in Apple Notes or copy someone’s homework in Google Docs, that same format will do the trick. The wild part is, the format wasn’t created by a conglomerate of tech tycoons, it was created by a curmudgeonly guy with a kind heart who right this minute is probably rewatching a Kubrick film while cheering for an absolutely indefensible sports team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s worth understanding how these simple little text files were born, not just because I get to brag about how generous and clever my friends are, but also because it reminds us of how the Internet really works: smart people think of good things that are crazy enough that they just might work, and then they give them away, over and over, until they slowly take over the world and make things better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making Their Mark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though it’s now a building block of the contemporary Internet, like so many great things, Markdown just started out trying to solve a personal problem. In 2002, John Gruber made the unconventional decision to bet his online career on two completely irrational foundations: Apple, and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to remember now, but in 2002, Apple was just a few years past having been on death’s door. As difficult as it may be to picture in today’s world where Apple keynotes are treated like major events, back then, almost nobody was covering Apple regularly, let alone writing exclusively about the company. There was barely even an “tech news” scene online at all, and virtually no one was blogging. So John’s decision to go all-in on Apple for his pioneering blog Daring Fireball was, well, a daring one. At the time, Apple had only just launched its first iPod that worked with Windows computers, and the iPhone was still a full five years in the future. But that single-minded focus, not just on Apple, but on obsessive detail in everything he covered, eventually helped inspire much of the technology media landscape that we see today. John’s timing was also perfect — from the doldrums of that era, Apple’s stock price would rise by about 120,000% in the years after Daring Fireball started, and its cultural relevance probably increased by even more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2004, it wasn’t just Apple that had begun to take off: blogs and social media themselves had moved from obscurity to the very center of culture, and a new era of web technology had begun. At the beginning of that year, few people in the world even knew what a “blog” was, but by the end of 2004, blogs had become not just ubiquitous, but downright cool. As unlikely as it seems now, that year’s largely uninspiring slate of U.S. presidential candidates like Wesley Clark, Gary Hart and, yes, Howard Dean helped propel blogs into mainstream awareness during the Democratic primaries, alongside online pundits who had begun weighing in on politics and the issues and cultural moments at a pace that newspapers and TV couldn’t keep up with. A lot has been written about the transformation of media during those years, but less has been written about how the media and tech of the time transformed each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That era of early blogging was interesting in that nearly everyone who was writing the first popular sites was also busy helping create the tools for publishing them. Just like Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had to pioneer combining studio-style flat lighting with 35mm filming in order to define the look of the modern sitcom, or Jimi Hendrix had to work with Roger Mayer to invent the signature guitar distortion pedals that defined the sound of rock and roll, the pioneers who defined the technical format and structures of blogging were often building the very tools of creation as they went along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a front row seat to these acts of creation. At the time I was working on Movable Type, which was the most popular tool for publishing “serious” blogs, and helped popularize the medium. Two of my good friends had built the tool and quickly made it into the default choice for anybody who wanted to reach a big audience; it was kind of a combination of everything people do these days on WordPress and all the various email newsletter platforms and all of the “serious” podcasts (since podcasts wouldn’t be invented for another few months). But back in those early days, we’d watch people use our tools to set up Gawker or Huffington Post one day, and Daring Fireball or Waxy.org the next, and each of them would be the first of its kind, both in terms of its design and its voice. To this day, when I see something online that I love by Julianne Escobedo Shepherd or Ta-Nehisi Coates or Nilay Patel or Annalee Newitz or any one of dozens of other brilliant writers or creators, my first thought is often, “hey! They used to type in that app that I used to make!” Because sometimes those writers would inspire us to make a new feature in the publishing tools, and sometimes they would have hacked up a new feature all by themselves in between typing up their new blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A really clear, and very simple, early example of how we learned that lesson was when we changed the size of the box that people used to type in just to create the posts on their sites. We made the box a little bit taller, mostly for aesthetic reasons. Within a few weeks, we’d found that posts on sites like Gawker had gotten longer, mostly because the box was bigger. This seems obvious now, years after we saw tweets get longer when Twitter expanded from 140 characters to 280 characters, but at the time this was a terrifying glimpse at how much power a couple of young product managers in a conference room in California would have over the media consumption of the entire world every time they made a seemingly-insignificant decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other dirty little secret was, typing in the box in that old blogging app could be… pretty wonky sometimes. People who wanted to do normal things like include an image or link in their blog post, or even just make some text bold, often had to learn somewhat-obscure HTML formatting, memorizing the actual language that’s used to make web pages. Not everybody knew all the details of how to make pages that way, and if they made even one small mistake, sometimes they could break the whole design of their site. It made things feel very fraught every time a writer went to publish something new online, and got in the way of the increasingly-fast pace of sharing ideas now that social media was taking over the public conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter John and his magical text files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Marking up and marking down&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of Markdown is really simple: It lets you use the regular characters on your keyboard which you already use while typing out things like emails, to make fancy formatting of text for the web. That HTML format that’s used to make web pages stands for HyperText Markup Language. The word “markup” there means you’re “marking up” your text with all kinds of special characters. Only, the special characters can be kind of arcane. Want to put in a link to everybody’s favorite website? Well, you’re going to have to type in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href="https://anildash.com/"&amp;gt;Anil Dash’s blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; I could explain why, and what it all means, but honestly, you get the point — it’s a lot! Too much. What if you could just write out the text and then the link, sort of like you might within an email? Like: &lt;code&gt;[Anil Dash’s blog](https://anildash.com)&lt;/code&gt;! And then the right thing would happen. Seems great, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same thing works for things like putting a header on a page. For example, as I’m writing this right now, if I want to put a big headline on this page, I can just type &lt;code&gt;#How Markdown Took Over the World&lt;/code&gt; and the right thing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If mark_up_ is complicated, then the opposite of that complexity must be… markd_own_. This kind of solution, where it’s so smart it seems obvious in hindsight, is key to Markdown’s success. John worked to make a format that was so simple that anybody could pick it up in a few minutes, and powerful enough that it could help people express pretty much anything that they wanted to include while writing on the internet. At a technical level, it was also easy enough to implement that John could write the code himself to make it work with Movable Type, his publishing tool of choice. (Within days, people had implemented the same feature for most of the other blogging tools of the era; these days, virtually every app that you can type text into ships with Markdown support as a feature on day one.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to launch, John had enlisted our mutual friend, the late, dearly missed Aaron Swartz, as a beta tester. In addition to being extremely fluent in every detail of the blogging technologies of the time, Aaron was, most notably, seventeen years old. And though Aaron’s activism and untimely passing have resulted in him having been turned into something of a mythological figure, one of the greatest things about Aaron was that he could be a total pain in the ass, which made him terrific at reporting bugs in your software. (One of the last email conversations I ever had with Aaron was him pointing out some obscure bugs in an open source app I was working on at the time.) No surprise, Aaron instantly understood both the potential and the power of Markdown, and was a top-tier beta tester for the technology as it was created. His astute feedback helped finely hone the final product so it was ready for the world, and when Markdown quietly debuted in March of 2004, it was clear that text files around the web were about to get a permanent upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most surprising part of what happened next wasn’t that everybody immediately started using it to write their blogs; that was, after all, what the tool was designed to do. It’s that everybody started using Markdown to do everything else, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hitting the Mark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s almost impossible to overstate the ubiquity of Markdown within the modern computer industry in the decades since its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After being nagged about it by users for more than a decade, Google finally added support for Markdown to Google Docs, though it took them years of fiddly improvements to make it truly usable. Just last year, Microsoft added support for Markdown to its venerable Notepad app, perhaps in attempt to assuage the tempers of users who were still in disbelief that Notepad had been bloated with AI features. Nearly every powerful group messaging app, from Slack to WhatsApp to Discord, has support for Markdown in messages. And even the company that indirectly inspired all of this in the first place finally got on board: the most recent version of Apple Notes finally added support for Markdown. (It’s an especially striking launch by Apple due to its timing, shortly after John had used his platform as the most influential Apple writer in the world to blog about the utter failure of the “Apple Intelligence” AI launch.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the apps that you use on your phone or your laptop. For developers, Markdown has long been the lingua franca of the tools we string together to accomplish our work. On GitHub, the platform that nearly every developer in the world uses to share their code, nearly every single repository of code on the site has at least one Markdown file that’s used to describe its contents. Many have dozens of files describing all the different aspects of their project. And some of the repositories on GitHub consist of nothing but massive collections of Markdown files. The small tools and automations we run to perform routine tasks, the one-off reports that we generate to make sure something worked correctly, the confirmations that we have a system email out when something goes wrong, the temporary files we use when trying to recover some old data — all of these default to being Markdown files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, there are now billions of Markdown files lying around on hard drives around the world. Billions more are stashed in the cloud. There are some on the phone in your pocket. Programmers leave them lying around wherever their code might someday be running. Your kid’s Nintendo Switch has Markdown files on it. If you’re listening to music, there’s probably a Markdown file on the memory chip of the tiny system that controls the headphones stuck in your ears. The Markdown is inside you right now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Down For Whatever&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, these were all things we could have foreseen when John first unleashed his little text tool on the world. I would have been surprised about how many people were using it, but not really the ways in which they were using it. If you’d have said “Twenty years in the future, all the different note-taking apps people use save their files using Markdown!”, I would have said, “Okay, that makes sense!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I wouldn’t have asked, though, was “Is John getting paid?” As hard as it may be to believe, back in 2004, the default was that people made new standards for open technologies like Markdown, and just shared them freely for the good of the internet, and the world, and then went on about their lives. If it happened to have unleashed billions of dollars of value for others, then so much the better. If they got some credit along the way, that was great, too. But mostly you just did it to solve a problem for yourself and for other like-minded people. And also, maybe, to help make sure that some jerk didn’t otherwise create some horrible proprietary alternative that would lock everybody into their terrible inferior version forever instead. (We didn’t have the word “enshittification” yet, but we did have Cory Doctorow and we did have plain text files, so we kind of knew where things were headed.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give a sense of the vibe of that era, the term “podcasting” had been coined just a month before Markdown was released, and went into wider use that fall, and was similarly a radically open system that wasn’t owned by any big company and that empowered people to do whatever they wanted to do to express themselves. (And podcasting was another technology that Aaron Swartz helped improve by being a brilliant pain in the ass. But I’ll save that story for another book-length essay.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That attitude of being not-quite-_anti_commercial, but perhaps just not even really concerned with whether something was commercial or not seems downright quaint in an era when the tech tycoons are not just the wealthiest people in the world, but also some of the weirdest and most obnoxious as well. But the truth is, most people today who make technology are actually still exceedingly normal, and quite generous. It’s just that they’ve been overshadowed by their bosses who are out of their minds and building rocket ships and siring hundreds of children and embracing overt white supremacy instead of making fun tools for helping you type text, like regular people do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Markdown Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The part about not doing this stuff solely for money matters, because even the most advanced LLM systems today, what the big AI companies call their “frontier” models, require complex orchestration that’s carefully scripted by people who’ve tuned their prompts for these systems through countless rounds of trial and error. They’ve iterated and tested and watched for the results as these systems hallucinated or failed or ran amok, chewing up countless resources along the way. And sometimes, they generated genuinely astonishing outputs, things that are truly amazing to consider that modern technology can achieve. The rate of progress and evolution, even factoring in the mind-boggling amounts of investment that are going into these systems, is rivaled only by the initial development of the personal computer or the Internet, or the early space race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And all of it — all of it — is controlled through Markdown files. When you see the brilliant work shown off from somebody who’s bragging about what they made ChatGPT generate for them, or someone is understandably proud about the code that they got Claude to create, all of the most advanced work has been prompted in Markdown. Though where the logic of Markdown was originally a very simple version of "use human language to tell the machine what to do", the implications have gotten far more dire when they use a format designed to help expresss "make this &lt;code&gt;**bold**&lt;/code&gt;" to tell the computer itself "&lt;code&gt;make this imaginary girlfriend more compliant&lt;/code&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we already know that the Big AI companies are run by people who don't reckon with the implications of their work. They could never understand that every single project that's even moderately ambitious on these new AI platforms is being written up in files formatted according to this system created by one guy who has never asked for a dime for this work. An entire generation of AI coders has been born since Markdown was created who probably can’t even imagine that this technology even has an "inventor". It’s just always been here, like the Moon, or Rihanna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s important for everyone to know that the Internet, and the tech industry, don’t run without the generosity and genius of regular people. It is not just billion-dollar checks and Silicon Valley boardrooms that enable creativity over years, decades, or generations — it’s often a guy with a day job who just gives a damn about doing something right, sweating the details and assuming that if he cares enough about what he makes then others will too. The majority of the technical infrastructure of the Internet was created in this way. For free, often by people in academia, or as part of their regular work, with no promise of some big payday or getting a ton of credit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who make the real Internet and the real innovations also don’t look for ways to hurt the world around them, or the people around them. Sometimes, as in the case of Aaron, the world hurts them more than anyone should ever have to bear. I know not everybody cares that much about plain text files on the Internet; I will readily admit I am a huge nerd about this stuff in a way that maybe most normal people are not. But I do think everybody cares about some part of the wonderful stuff on the Internet in this way, and I want to fight to make sure that everybody can understand that it’s not just five terrible tycoons who built this shit. Real people did. Good people. I saw them do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trillion-dollar AI industry's system for controlling their most advanced platforms is a plain text format one guy made up for his blog and then bounced off of a 17-year-old kid before sharing it with the world for free. You're welcome, Time Magazine's people of the year, The Architects of AI. Their achievement is every bit as impressive as yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Ten Technical Reasons Markdown Won&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, with some of the narrative covered, what can we learn from Markdown’s success? How did this thing really take off? What could we do if we wanted to replicate something like this in the modern era? Let’s consider a few key points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Had a great brand.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s be real: “Markdown” as a name is clever as hell. Get it it’s not markup, it’s mark down. You just can’t argue with that kind of logic. People who knew what the “M” in “HTML” stood for could understand the reference, and to everyone else, it was just a clearly-understandable name for a useful utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Solved a real problem.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is not obvious, but it’s really important that a new technology have a real problem that it’s trying to solve, instead of just being an abstract attempt to do something vague, like “make text files better”. Millions of people were encountering the idea that it was too difficult or inconvenient to write out full HTML by hand, and even if one had the necessary skills, it was nice to be able to do so in a format that was legible as plain text as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Built on behaviors that already existed.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one of the most quietly genius parts of Markdown: The format is based on the ways people had been adding emphasis and formatting to their text for years or even decades. Some of the formatting choices dated back to the early days of email, so they’d been ingrained in the culture of the internet for a full generation before Markdown existed. It was so familiar, people could be writing Markdown without even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Mirrored RSS in its origin.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the same time that Markdown was taking off, RSS was maturing into its ubiquitous form as well. The format had existed for some years already, enabling various kinds of content syndication, but at this time, it was adding support for the technologies that would come to be known as podcasting as well. And just like RSS, Markdown was spearheaded by a smart technologist who was also more than a little stubborn about defining a format that would go on to change the way we share content on the internet. In RSS’ case, it was pioneered by Dave Winer, and with Markdown it was John Gruber, and both were tireless in extolling the virtues of the plain text formats they’d helped pioneer. They could both leverage blogs to get the word out, and to get feedback on how to build on their wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5. There was a community ready to help.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One great thing about a format like Markdown is that its success is never just the result of one person. Vitally, Markdown was part of a community that could build on it right from the start. Right from the beginning, Markdown was inspired by earlier works like Textile, a formatting system for plain text created by Dean Allen. Many of us appreciated and were inspired by Dean, who was a pioneer of blogging tools in the early days of social media, but if there’s a bigger fan of Dean Allen on the internet than John Gruber, I’ve never met them. Similarly, Aaron Swartz, the brilliant young technologist who’s known best known as an activist for digital rights and access, was at that time just a super brilliant teenager that a lot of us loved hacking with. He was the most valuable beta tester of Markdown prior to its release, helping to shape it into a durable and flexible format that’s stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;6. Had the right flavor for every different context.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Markdown’s format was frozen in place (and had some super-technical details that people could debate about) and people wanted to add features over time, various communities that were implementing Markdown could add their own “flavors” of it as they needed. Popular ones came to be called Commonmark and Github-Flavored, led by various companies or teams that had divergent needs for the tool. While tech geeks tend to obsess over needing everything to be “correct”, in reality it often just doesn’t matter that much, and in the real world, the entire Internet is made up of content that barely follows the technical rules that it’s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;7. Released at a time of change in behaviors and habits.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a subtle point, but an important one: Markdown came along at the right time in the evolution of its medium. You can get people to change their behaviors when they’re using a new tool, or adopting a new technology. In this case, blogging (and all of social media!) were new, so saying “here’s a new way of typing a list of bullet points” wasn’t much an additional learning curve to add to the mix. If you can take advantage of catching people while they’re already in a learning mood, you can really tap into the moment when they’re most open-minded to new things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;8. Came right on the cusp of the “build tool era”.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one’s a bit more technical, but also important to understand. In the first era of building for the web, people often built the web’s languages of HTML, Javascript and CSS by hand, by themselves, or stitched these formats together from subsets or templates. But in many cases, these were fairly simple compositions, made up of smaller pieces that were written in the same languages. As things matured, the roles for web developers specialized (there started to be backend developers vs. front-end, or people who focused on performance vs. those who focused on visual design), and as a result the tooling for developers matured. On the other side of this transition, developers began to use many different programming languages, frameworks and tools, and the standard step before trying to deploy a website was to have an automated build process that transformed the “raw materials” of the site into the finished product. Since Markdown is a raw material that has to be transformed into HTML, it perfectly fit this new workflow as it became the de facto standard method of creation and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;9. Worked with “View source”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the technologies that work best on the web enable creators to “view source” just like HTML originally did when the first web browsers were created. In this philosophy, one can look at the source code that makes up a web page, and understand how it was constructed so that you can make your own. With Markdown, it only takes one glimpse of a source Markdown file for anyone to understand how they might make a similar file of their own, or to extrapolate how they might apply analogous formatting to their own documents. There’s no teaching required when people can just see it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;10. Not encumbered in IP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one’s obvious if you think about it, but it can’t go unsaid: There are no legal restrictions around Markdown. You wouldn’t think that anybody would be foolish or greedy enough to try to patent something as simple as Markdown, but there are many far worse examples of patent abuse in the tech industry. Fortunately, John Gruber is not an awful person, and nobody else has (yet) been brazen enough to try to usurp the format for their own misadventures in intellectual property law. As a result, nobody’s been afraid, either to use the format, or to support creating or reading the format in their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I work as an Engineering Manager at Google, and my teams practice a simple habit – we book all meetings to start at five minutes past the hour (or half hour).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works better than trying to finish five minutes early. Meetings often don’t finish on time, and the impact is highest with back-to-back meetings. If you try to end at 1:55pm, you will likely talk until 2:00pm anyway, which then runs into the next meeting. But shifting the start time usually guarantees a break. Why? Because there is strong social pressure not to allow meetings to run much past the top of the hour when that is the official end-time. The same social pressure applies to meetings that end at the half-hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That short break changes the tone of a meeting. It takes a minute or two to move between events, even online. When people arrive at 1:05pm, they are settled and less stressed. You might fear that people will start arriving at 1:07pm, but I have seen the opposite. They respect the new time. They arrive by 1:05pm, ready to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do we lose five minutes in every meeting? In theory, yes. But meetings rarely started on the dot anyway before this change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On balance, it is a win. The best proof is that the entire org does it now (the org didn’t copy my team — it just started organically), even though it is not mandatory. In fact this approach is successful because it is not mandatory. People can’t be sure when the next meeting starts for their colleagues, so they finish the current meeting at the top of the hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like good code, a good team is built on small, sane details. Giving people five minutes to clear their heads, between back-to-back meetings, is a detail that works. Try it — you’ll see it improves your day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that entire sections describing domestic U.S. intelligence facilities were deliberately removed from two published documents, while equivalent foreign facilities remained visible. The evidence exists in an unexpected place - the PDF metadata of documents published by The Intercept in 2016, and by The Intercept and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in a 2017 collaborative investigation. To our knowledge, this is the first time this information has been revealed publicly. The removed sections reveal the operational designations and cover name structure for domestic U.S. NRO Mission Ground Stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using PDF analysis tools, we found hidden text embedded in the metadata versioning of two documents published alongside investigative stories about NSA satellite surveillance facilities. These metadata artifacts prove that earlier versions of the documents contained detailed descriptions of domestic U.S. ground stations that were systematically scrubbed before publication (not just redacted with black boxes, but with text completely removed).&lt;/p&gt;What was published from the Snowden documents:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Operational details for RAF Menwith Hill Station (UK)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Operational details for Pine Gap (Australia)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS) - Washington, DC. Public cover name: "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center" (CWRTC).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS) - Denver area. Public cover name: "Aerospace Data Facility" (ADF).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facilities themselves are not unknown. "Aerospace Data Facility" at Buckley Space Force Base is publicly acknowledged as a National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Mission Ground Station. "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center" at Naval Research Laboratory is publicly acknowledged, though its designation as a Mission Ground Station is less clear. What's NOT public (until now) is the specific operational designations used in classified networks: "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)" and "Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)." The Snowden documents prove these are deliberate cover names (not just alternative terminology) and show exactly what's classified and what's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hidden PDF versions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first PDF document titled "Menwith satellite classification guide" has two versions in the file metadata: an older one and a newer one. The removed information exists in the earlier version, and is completely removed in the second, published version. This is not standard redaction with black boxes - the text was completely deleted from the visible document while remaining embedded in the PDF's internal version history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the first version of the document, containing the hidden text (sections 5.1.5.2 - 5.1.5.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the second version of the document, where the text is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removed text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;5.1.5.2 (U) Facility Name: Formally identified as the ,Mission Support Facility(MSF) also re- ferred as the Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC). 5.1.5.3 (S//TK) Cover Story: The fact of a cover story is S//TK, the cover story itself is unclas- sified. 5.1.5.4 (U) Software development, maintenance, testing, and communications support to a world-wide Navy communications and reporting system. 5.1.5.5 (U) Associations: 1. The term Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)=S//TK 2. The term Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)=UNCLASSIFIED 3. The term Naval Research Laboratory=UNCLASSIFIED 4. The fact that CWRTC is the cover name for the PMGS=S//TK 5. The fact that CWRTC is a communications and data relay location for the US=UNCLASSIFIED (no association w/NRO) 6. The fact that PMGS is located on the NRL=S//TK 7. The fact that the NRO has a MGS located on the NRL=S//TK 8. The fact that the CWRTC is located on the NRL=UNCLASSIFIED (no association w/NRO) 9. CWRTC associated w/NRO=S//TK 10. Association of NRO, CIA, or NSA personnel with the CWRTC=S//TK 11. Association of CWRTC with other NRO MGS=S//TK 12. Association of MSF with the NRO=S//TK. 13. Association of CWRTC with the ADF=UNCLASSIFIED (no association w/NRO) 5.1.5.6 (U) Visitors: CWRTC is housed within buildings 259 and 260 on the Naval Research Laboratory in Southwest Washington, DC.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second document "NRO SIGINT Guide for Pine Gap" also has two versions in the file metadata: an older one and a newer one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the first version of the document, containing the hidden text (section 5.1.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot from the second version of the document, where the text is removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removed text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;5.1.2 (S//TK) Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS) 5.1.2.1 (U) Facility Name: Aerospace Data Facility (ADF) 5.1.2.2 (S//TK) Cover Story: The fact of a cover story is S/TK, the cover story itself is unclassi- fied.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the "hidden version" of the document "Menwith satellite classification guide" section 5.1.5 describes a facility formally identified by its cover name "Mission Support Facility (MSF)," also referred to as the "Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)." The classified operational designation is Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: Buildings 259 and 260, Naval Research Laboratory, Southwest Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public cover story: "Software development, maintenance, testing, and communications support to a world-wide Navy communications and reporting system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual function: Mission Ground Station in the National Reconnaissance Office's satellite intelligence network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document explicitly states that "the fact of a cover story is S//TK" - meaning even acknowledging that CWRTC is a cover name (rather than the facility's real identity) is classified Secret/Talent Keyhole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classification guide provides a detailed breakdown of what's public and what's secret:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;"Classic Wizard Reporting and Testing Center (CWRTC)" = UNCLASSIFIED&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;"Potomac Mission Ground Station (PMGS)" = S//TK (SECRET)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The fact that CWRTC is a cover name for PMGS = S//TK (SECRET)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Association of NRO, CIA, or NSA personnel with CWRTC = S//TK (SECRET)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This layered classification allows the facility to operate under a public identity while keeping its actual intelligence designation and function secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the "hidden version" of the document "NRO SIGINT Guide for Pine Gap" section 5.1.2 describes a facility identified by the cover name "Aerospace Data Facility (ADF)". The classified operational designation is "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station (CDMGS)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: Buckley Space Force Base, Aurora, Colorado&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public acknowledgment: Publicly known as "Aerospace Data Facility-Colorado." For example ADF-C is openly described in Wikipedia as an NRO facility for "command and control of reconnaissance satellites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's NOT public: The operational designation "Consolidated Denver Mission Ground Station" and the fact that "Aerospace Data Facility" is a cover name for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with PMGS, the classification guide shows "the fact of a cover story is S//TK" - the deception itself is classified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both hidden facilities appear in an organizational classification table in the Pine Gap guide. The table's visual structure reveals which names refer to the same facilities through deliberate formatting. Thicker borders separate distinct facility groups, while thinner borders separate columns within each group (this might be a bit hard to see from the screenshot/document). Each facility appears multiple times - once under its classified operational designation, and again under its unclassified cover name(s):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groupings show:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Denver facility: CDMGS (real designation) + ADF (cover name) + FSD (Field Station Denver, cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Potomac facility: PMGS (real designation) + MSF (cover name) + CWRTC (cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Menwith Hill: HMGS (real designation) + RAF MHS (cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pine Gap: AMGS (real designation) + JDFPG (cover name)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each facility, the real operational designation (CDMGS, PMGS, HMGS, AMGS) has all agency associations classified S//TK (Secret). But the cover names have NSA and NGA associations marked as unclassified (U) or For Official Use Only (U//FOUO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a classification system where you can publicly acknowledge intelligence work using sanitized facility names, while the actual operational designations remain secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic facilities use two cover names each (ADF + FSD for Denver; MSF + CWRTC for Potomac), while foreign facilities use only one. This suggests layered operational security for facilities on U.S. soil - possibly to navigate Congressional oversight, legal restrictions on domestic intelligence operations, or different audiences requiring different levels of plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a deliberate pattern in these two classification guides: detailed sections describing specific U.S. facilities were removed, while equivalent foreign facility sections were published intact. The 2016 Menwith Hill guide had its PMGS section (5.1.5) completely removed. The 2017 Pine Gap guide had its CDMGS section (5.1.2) completely removed. Both guides retained their detailed descriptions of foreign facilities, including operational designations, cover stories, and visitor protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. facilities weren't entirely absent from the published documents. The Pine Gap classification table shows CDMGS, PMGS, ADF, and other U.S. facility designations alongside foreign facilities, revealing the structure of the Mission Ground Station network. Other published documents from both investigations mention U.S. facilities. What was specifically removed were the detailed classification guide sections that would have explained these U.S. facilities the same way Menwith Hill and Pine Gap were explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who edited the documents?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDF metadata provides forensic evidence of the editing process. The Pine Gap classification guide shows timestamps from July 31, 2017, three weeks before publication. Two versions were created minutes apart using Nitro Pro 8, a commercial PDF editor: version 1 at 13:48:54 (containing the CDMGS section) and version 2 at 13:50:48 (with CDMGS removed). The Intercept and ABC published identical PDFs with the same metadata artifacts, indicating the editing was done once and the same file shared between organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intercept, as holder of the Snowden archive, likely handled technical document preparation for publications. The Menwith Hill classification guide, published solely by The Intercept in 2016, shows more thorough metadata sanitization but the same editorial pattern - domestic facility sections removed while foreign equivalents remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We contacted Ryan Gallagher, the journalist who led both investigations, to ask about the editorial decision to remove these sections. After more than a week, we have not received a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next part will be a technical deep-dive into PDF metadata across the published Snowden documents. We found that many documents contain multiple versions in their metadata, revealing the editorial redaction process: visible NSA agents' usernames that were later removed, screenshots that were later redacted, and surveillance data that went through multiple rounds of redaction. We'll also document cases of failed redactions - including one where redacted text remained fully copyable, previously reported only by a Polish cybersecurity blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can extract versions from a PDF file for example with a pdfresurrect tool (pdfresurrect -w filename.pdf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can download the document versions directly here:&lt;/p&gt;Menwith satellite classification guide versions: NRO SIGINT Guide for Pine Gap versions:&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2023, Apple sunsetted (pun intended) the Dark Sky mobile app on iOS. Apple purchased the company behind the popular weather application in early 2020, then announced that it would be shutting down the Dark Sky applications (first on Android, then on iOS and web), and finally stated in 2022 that the forecast technology would be integrated into the Apple Weather app with iOS 16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dark Sky was much more than just an API or a set of “forecast technologies.” The design of the Dark Sky mobile application represented a hallmark of information design because the team clearly obsessed over how people would actually use the app on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a gallery of screenshots I personally took in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of Dark Sky was so wonderful that I could understand the shape of the weather at a glance, even from a zoomed out view of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Common use cases for a weather app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we can dissect what makes the design of this app so special, let’s define the most common use cases for a weather app. A good weather app attempts to address a range of use cases in a person’s life. Here are some common use cases for a weather app, starting with the contextual goals first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the questions I want to answer vary based on the context and situation I’m in. This is the perfect situation for software that embraces good information design principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Magic Ink, Bret Victor defined information design “as the design of context-sensitive information graphics.” Unlike static graphics, like a weather map in a newspaper, information graphics in software can be highly dynamic and can incorporate context from the user’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky aggressively leaned into these ideas, and the team worked hard to turn nearly everything in the application into a context-sensitive information graphic. Let’s dive deeper into some examples where this notion is in full display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the day at a precise location&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll start by listing my goals when trying to understand the upcoming weather for the day:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default experience for the Dark Sky application is to show weather for the next 12 hours at my precise location. Here are three screenshots from the app, from different days and locations. What do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app contextualizes the information that’s presented based on what’s most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the left-most screenshot, the context of the weather storm that’s passing by my location and some potential light rain is emphasized to the user. The wind advisory and dip in the “feels like” temperature also make honorable mentions. In combination with the clickable Wind Advisory warning, I can quickly understand that the storm has passed my specific location but I should still be mindful of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the middle screenshot, the storm front heading my direction, the imminent rain starting within the hour, and the hours of rain later in the day are emphasized front and center. Based on my interest in the rain, I scrolled down (not shown in screenshot) to switch from temperature to rain probability for the main weather view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the right-most screenshot, the temperature distribution throughout the day is emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of little details that are easy to miss, as well. For example, all three screenshots above start showing weather information starting at the current moment (“now”) and onwards. This is brilliant, because I only occasionally care about weather from a few hours or days ago. (To accommodate those situations, the app did have a unique Time Machine view to explore past weather data.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather forecast for the week&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit our goals when trying to understand the weather for the week:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many other weather apps focus on helping me understand the weather at the city level, the Dark Sky app differentiates itself by enabling me to understand the weather with a hyperlocal view. I can view the weather at specific addresses and landmarks and understand how the weather might be different in a city center compared to the towns around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the Dark Sky app shows the weekly weather summary at my current location (screenshot on the left). I can contextualize the weekly weather view by clicking the search icon and typing in the alternative location I’m interested in (screenshot on the right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a glance, I can quickly understand:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days are likely to rain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which days have wide temperature ranges (low lows and high highs).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The general shape of the weather (micro-trends).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gallery of subtle design elements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first few sections, I laid the groundwork by diving a bit more deeply into specific aspects of Dark Sky. Now that I’ve hopefully engaged your critical design eye, I’d like to elevate other elements in the app’s design in a more rapid-fire fashion. I hope that this section will provide some ideas and inspiration for people designing their own data-rich applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preserving temperature magnitudes in ranges&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To represent data visually, the data needs to be mapped from “data space” to “pixel space”. In some domains and scenarios, you want to ensure the magnitudes are carried over, and in others you want to rescale the values to a fixed scale so the resulting charts are more consistent in the space and pixels they take up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Dark Sky app, the “temperature pills” representing the forecasted temperatures for the upcoming week preserve their existing magnitude more effectively in the visualization. The temperature values are more tightly integrated with the visual representation, making the combined experience more amenable to quick comparison across multiple days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many weather apps opt for the design pattern on the right, where all temperature ranges are rescaled to take up the same amount of space in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacing numbers with rough categories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interpreting hourly distributions of rainfall or snowfall can be difficult. Is 0.25 inches of rain a lot over the next hour? What about 0.2 inches of snow per hour for the next hour, then 0.15 for the hour after that? How do I prepare for these circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help users stay informed and take action, the app will often replace precise forecast distributions of rainfall and snowfall with rough categories instead. This design choice has two positive effects on users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It contextualizes the forecast to simpler categories that can help us quickly make changes in our life if needed. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Light snow that starts and stops means that my snow shoveling company won’t come out, but heavy snow means they likely will.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Heavy snow means I should probably make sure my outdoor furniture is better covered and ready to take the snow.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It removes a sense of artificial precision that doesn’t really exist because weather forecasts fundamentally have very high uncertainty and error bands.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contextualized storm map&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple color scales combined with arrows go a very long way to conveying relevant storm information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wind direction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of conveying wind direction using text (“NW” or “Northwest”), the app uses arrows! If the wind shifts directions throughout the day, I can feel the wind direction changing using my body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Complaints from former Dark Sky users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I could probably write an entire book about the design of Dark Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to share some passionate comments from other Dark Sky fans. While most of them aren’t data viz or design nerds, they feel that the Apple Weather app is not a sufficient replacement. These people relied on Dark Sky to make decisions and grew very attached to an application that integrated deeply into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;0000GKP on Reddit: “I have already made the transition to the Weather app. The information is presented in a much less efficient manner than Dark Sky so it takes more effort to get it, but it is all there (except for cloud cover).”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TheGeckoDude on Reddit: “Is there anything that has the precipitation graph similar to dark sky? The biggest thing I will miss from dark sky is that graph. I’m outside a lot and it is super helpful for knowing when to take cover or when it might rain. I need to find a feature like that because the vague weather precipitation info will not cut it for me.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s make data shine!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark Sky started with publicly available data, augmented it with contextualized predictions, rigorously iterated on data visualization design, and packaged all of this into a contextualized experience to make weather data useful for me in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the availability of data has never been higher, we’re still missing software experiences that contextualize that data to make our lives better. Data alone isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world needs more Dark Sky-like experiences to help us improve our spending habits, help us sleep better, and more. If you’re working on information software, I hope you can be inspired by the body of design and engineering work that Dark Sky pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;UK government exempting itself from flagship cyber law inspires little confidence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ministers promise equivalent standards just without the legal obligation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ANALYSIS From May's cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency to the Foreign Office breach months later, cyber incidents have become increasingly common in UK government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale extends far beyond these high-profile cases: the NCSC reports that 40 percent of attacks it managed between September 2020 and August 2021 targeted the public sector, a figure expected to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given this threat landscape, why does the UK's flagship Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill exclude both central and local government?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sir Oliver Dowden, former digital secretary and current shadow deputy PM, led calls in the House of Commons this week urging Labour to rethink its stance on excluding central government from the Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I would just urge the minister, as this bill passes through Parliament, to look again at that point, and I think there is a case for putting more stringent requirements on the public sector in order to force ministers' minds on that point."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CSR bill was announced days into Sir Keir Starmer's tenure as Prime Minister, aiming to provide an essential refresh of the country's heavily outdated NIS 2018 regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It proposed to bring managed service providers into scope, as was scheduled in 2022 before those plans fell by the wayside, and datacenters, among many other aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallels can be drawn with the EU's NIS2. However, the CSR bill's scope is narrower, excluding public authorities, unlike the EU's equivalent regulatory refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ian Murray, minister of state across two government departments and responsible, in part, for data policy and public sector reform, thanked Dowden for his suggestions and promised to take them on board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In responding to the shadow deputy PM, Murray also pointed to the Government Cyber Action Plan, which it launched hours before the CSR bill was set for a second reading in the Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This plan will ostensibly hold government departments to equal security standards as the CSR bill... just without any of the legal obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynics may see it as a tool to quell any criticisms of the bill's scope not extending to central government, all without making any hard security commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Dowden noted in the Commons on Tuesday, cybersecurity is a matter that is often deprioritized quickly in government. "I welcome the minister's comments about the obligation on the public sector. However, I would caution him that, in my experience, cybersecurity is one of those things that ministers talk about but then other priorities overtake it. And the advantage of legislative requirements is that it forces ministers to think about it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I do think that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on ministers in terms of their accountability for cybersecurity. I fear that if we don't put this into primary legislation, it's something that can slip further and further down ministers' in-trays. Whilst [some] ministers may have a desire to address it, other, more pressing, immediate problems distract their attention."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could argue that if the government is serious about holding itself to the same standards as the critical service providers in scope of the CSR bill, it would just bring itself and local authorities also into scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neil Brown, director at British law firm decoded.legal, told The Register: "The argument is that government departments will be held to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, and so do not need to be included. This does not fill me with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"If the government is going to hold itself to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, then it has nothing to fear from being included in the bill since, by definition, it will be compliant."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labour MP Matt Western, who also chairs the National Security Strategy joint committee, suggested that the CSR bill would not be a cure-all, but the first of many pieces of bespoke legislation the government will pass to improve national security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests the government is considering specific legislation to shore up public sector security further down the line. Perhaps this is wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UK's Cyber Security and Resilience Bill makes Parliamentary debut&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UK tech minister booted out in weekend cabinet reshuffle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UK threatens £100K-a-day fines under new cyber bill&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Revamped UK cybersecurity bill couldn't come soon enough, but details are patchy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brown told us "separate legislation does not sound like a terrible idea," and notes that existing UK telecoms law is separated for effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, for example, both seek to improve security in the telco space, but target different organizations. Security requirements often differ between types of organization, so potentially reserving a public sector-specific cybersecurity bill could be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ministers' plans also include a provision in the bill to introduce new legislative amendments as needed, to meet the demands of a rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape, leaving behind the Brexit-related hindrances that delayed the previous NIS updates in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the likelihood of being able to deliver on effective legislative amendments at pace is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arguably, if the government wanted to do it correctly, it would carry out a comprehensive (and lengthy) industry consultation before pushing any amendments through the two Houses, another typically arduous process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether this way of iterating on existing law could balance speed with comprehensiveness in unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Brown, the approach taken by Labour – to legislate in smaller steps – seems like the smarter choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"My preference is to legislate little and often, iterating as needed, rather than trying to create one piece of legislation which is all things to all people," he says. "Legislation inevitably entails compromise, and often reflects the divergent interests of numerous interested parties (including lobbying groups) – I look, for instance, at the Online Safety Act 2023. Smaller bills/acts, more targeted in scope, responding to a clearly-articulated problem statement, seems more sensible to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As to whether the CSR would result in a better outcome than NIS2, I'm afraid I do not know."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the scale of the cyber threat facing the UK's public sector, failing to account for this in the CSR bill could open the government up to intense scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The National Audit Office's report into UK government security improvements in January 2025 laid bare the sorry state of its systems. Of the 72 most critical systems run by various departments, 58 were reviewed; auditors found a litany of security flaws across them and noted a staggeringly slow pace at which the issues were being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is not an assessment which goes hand-in-hand with a public sector free from regular cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each time a central authority, arm's-length body, local council, or NHS trust is compromised, the government's decision not to include the public sector within the scope of the CSR bill hands the opposition another opportunity to question its commitment to cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labour does, at least, have some ammo to fire back if this scenario were to ever become reality, with the Conservatives having failed to enact the cybersecurity recommendations from its 2022 consultation, despite having had more than two years to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with the government's Cyber Action Plan, its reluctance to bring the public sector into the scope of its flagship cyber legislation fails to inspire any confidence that it has serious ambitions to improve security in this problem area. ®&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I replaced Windows with Linux and everything’s going great&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux diary, chapter one: winging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux diary, chapter one: winging it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In November, I got fed up and said screw it, I’m installing Linux. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS without spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s increasingly annoying OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that only works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Day one&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I picked CachyOS rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the installation instructions in the Cachy wiki and download the CachyOS live image to a Ventoy USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like Pop_OS! and Mint, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on Arch, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the Dual Boot Diaries podcast — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a 4TB storage drive with just over a terabyte of data on it, so I shrink that partition down to 2TB using the installer’s manual partitioning interface, then (following the guide) make a 2GB boot partition and a root partition using the btrfs file system. The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I have to pick one of thirteen different desktop environments. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE. I could rabbit-hole on this, but I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then I just have to pick a username and password and name the computer. After some thought, I go with Maggie, after my in-laws’ cat, who half the family calls Linux. She doesn’t answer to either name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation takes six minutes. I reboot the computer, and it loads into the Limine bootloader, which has also found my Windows install, so I can choose between Cachy and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I’m on the Cachy desktop, and my mouse buttons still aren’t working. Swapping USB ports doesn’t do anything. Plugging in my trackball doesn’t fix it either. I finally try unplugging the mouse, which makes the trackball work normally. My gaming mouse is an ancient Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7; it turns out this is a known issue. I defer editing configuration files for now and just keep the mouse unplugged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stuff that works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That weird mouse aside, all of the hardware I’ve tried so far has just worked. Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s missing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers. Firefox and Chromium will do. I can’t find official apps for Airtable (which I use for work), Spotify, or Apple Music, but they all work fine in the browser in the short term, and I’ll revisit this later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shall we play a game?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cachy has a one-click gaming package install that includes the Proton compatibility layer, Steam, and Heroic (a launcher for Epic, GOG, and Amazon). I figure I ought to try one game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading The Outer Worlds, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that only works for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The children yearn for the mines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I’ve had so far is Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. For some reason, Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making a Linux version of Bedrock. Java Edition works fine in Linux, but I play Minecraft with my kids, and they’re on Bedrock Edition on their iPads. There’s supposed to be a way to run the Android app with MCPE Launcher, but I couldn’t get it to work. There’s also a project to get the Windows version running on Proton, which will be my next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stuff I haven’t tried yet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear good things about howdy, a Linux equivalent to Windows Hello face authentication, but I haven’t installed it yet. I hear the Zen browser is a good Arc alternative. I also haven’t gotten my cloud storage synced, configured git so I can compile programs from scratch, figured out a backup strategy, or tried much other hardware beyond what’s currently plugged into my computer. There’s a command-line Spotify player I want to try. I’ve only scratched the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did take the time to install a KDE Plasma theme that makes it look like Windows XP, though. Just because.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Regret level: none&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m well aware this is the honeymoon phase. And using Linux for less than a week isn’t exactly a flex. Many people use Linux. And I haven’t even tried doing anything particularly difficult, or playing a game that came out this decade. But so far it’s been a much easier transition than expected, and a quieter experience overall. My OS isn’t trying to change my browser or search engine to make some shareholder happy somewhere. It’s not nudging me to try some bullshit AI feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will I go crawling back to macOS or Windows the first time I have to edit a batch of photos? Possibly! I’ll definitely boot back into Windows — or pull out a Chromebook — to play Minecraft with my kids, if I can’t get it running on Linux. And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use Linux exclusively; my job as a reviews editor means I have to stay familiar with as many operating systems as possible. (This is a good way to drive yourself nuts.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll run into plenty of fun problems soon enough. But the first few days have been great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Self Charging Drones&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Voltair builds drones that ‘perch’ like birds to recharge on power lines. For this first time, this allows for drones with infinite range. Removing battery swaps is the last step to deploy UAVs autonomously at scale. After building drones for the Air Force and DARPA, Ronan realized this was both practical and technically feasible. Power utilities are the perfect first customer. Drone inspections identify maintenance concerns before they cause faults. Faults cause power outages, and spark wildfires - like the Eaton Fire in early 2025 where 19 people lost their lives and nearly 10,000 structures were destroyed. Fires bankrupt utilities and make them uninsurable. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost. Since June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles. After power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate and other inspection markets. Insurance and grid traders also want our data product. At scale we are a new infrastructure layer for data on the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story circulating is that AI is killing Open Source businesses. I don't think that is quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI didn't kill Tailwind's business. It stress tested it. Their business model failed the test, but that is not an indictment of all Open Source business models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind's business model worked for years. It relied on developers visiting their documentation, discovering Tailwind Plus while browsing, and buying it. Tailwind Plus is a $299 collection of pre-built UI components. Traffic led to discovery, and discovery drove sales. It was a reasonable business model, but always fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last year, more and more developers started asking AI for code instead of reading documentation, and their sales and marketing funnel broke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a fairness issue here that I don't want to skip past. AI companies trained their models on Tailwind's documentation and everything the community wrote about it. And now those models generate Tailwind code and answer Tailwind questions without sending anyone to Tailwind's website. The value got extracted, but compensation isn't flowing back. That bothers me, and it deserves a broader policy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I keep coming back to is this: AI commoditizes anything you can fully specify. Documentation, pre-built card components, a CSS library, Open Source plugins. Tailwind's commercial offering was built on "specifications". AI made those things trivial to generate. AI can ship a specification but it can't run a business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does value live now? In what requires showing up, not just specifying. Not what you can specify once, but what requires showing up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Value is shifting to operations: deployment, testing, rollbacks, observability. You can't prompt 99.95% uptime on Black Friday. Neither can you prompt your way to keeping a site secure, updated, and running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why Vercel created Next.js and gives it away for free. The Open Source framework is the conduit; the hosting is the product. Same with Acquia, my own company. A big part of Acquia's business model is selling products around Drupal: hosting, search, CI/CD pipelines, digital asset management, and more. We don't sell describable things; we sell operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Source was never the commercial product. It's the conduit to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked what to pivot to, Wathan was candid: "Still to this day, I don't know what we should be pivoting to". I've written about how digital agencies might evolve, but CSS frameworks and component libraries are a harder case. Some Open Source projects make for great features, but not great businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailwind CSS powers millions of sites. The framework will survive. Whether the company does is a different question. I'm rooting for them. The world needs more successful Open Source businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In northern Germany, researchers have filmed brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) leaping from cave ledges to catch bats mid-flight — the first evidence that rodents can intercept flying mammals. The finding, published in Global Ecology and Conservation, turns one of ecology’s everyday characters into an unexpectedly agile predator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The behavior was recorded at Segeberg Kalkberg, a limestone cave that shelters around 30,000 hibernating bats each winter. Using infrared video over five weeks in autumn 2020 and thermal cameras from 2021 to 2024, a team led by Florian Gloza-Rausch in Bad Segeberg captured footage that’s unusual, for sure: a rat balancing on its hind legs at the cave entrance, sensing the movement of wings in the dark, then springing up to seize a bat from the air.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across five weeks of monitoring, the researchers confirmed 13 kills and found a hidden cache of 52 bat carcasses — clear signs that the rats weren’t scavenging leftovers but hunting deliberately. At that rate, a small group of rats could wipe out about 7% of the bat population in a single season.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s remarkable for an animal not built for flight or pursuit. Brown rats are omnivores that typically scavenge or prey on slow-moving targets. Yet here, they appear to have developed two hunting strategies: aerial interception at the cave mouth and ground attacks on bats crawling to roost. How the rats locate their targets in near-darkness isn’t fully clear, but researchers suspect they use whisker and hearing cues rather than sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar: Brain-Wide Map Shows How Prior Knowledge Guides Mouse Decisions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study describes this as unexpected behavioral plasticity in brown rats. The researchers believe the dense streams of bats and the narrow cave geometry created the perfect ambush zone — a place where a patient predator could learn a new trick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery also adds a new stressor to European bat populations, which are already under pressure from habitat loss and disease. Because brown rats are invasive across much of the continent, their access to major hibernation sites could have lasting ecological effects. The authors suggest managing rat presence near large roosts as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the most compelling part of the finding lies not in its numbers but in its image: a common city rat, usually seen raiding bins, now standing alert in a cave mouth, hunting with precision that blurs the line between scavenger and specialist. It’s a reminder that adaptation doesn’t always unfold in distant rainforests — sometimes it happens under our own streetlights, in ways no one thought to look for.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bichon is an open-source email archiving system that synchronizes emails from IMAP servers, indexes them for full-text search, and provides a REST API for programmatic access. Unlike email clients, Bichon is designed for archiving and searching rather than sending/receiving emails. It runs as a standalone server application that continuously synchronizes configured email accounts and maintains a searchable local archive. Built in Rust, it requires no external dependencies and provides fast, efficient email archiving, management, and search through a built-in WebUI. Its name is inspired by the puppy my daughter adopted last month.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Email Import (EML &amp;amp; MBOX) — Import existing mail archives via the bichonctl CLI&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I released rustmailer, an email API middleware:&lt;lb/&gt; https://github.com/rustmailer/rustmailer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve received many emails asking whether it could also archive emails, perform unified search, and support full-text indexing—not just querying recipients.&lt;lb/&gt; But rustmailer was designed as a middleware focused on providing API services.&lt;lb/&gt; Adding archiving and full-text search would complicate its core purpose and go far beyond its original scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I realized that email archiving itself only requires a small portion of rustmailer’s functionality, plus a search engine.&lt;lb/&gt; With that combination, building a dedicated, efficient archiver becomes much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the experience gained from rustmailer, I designed and built Bichon in less than two weeks, followed by another two weeks of testing and optimization.&lt;lb/&gt; It has now reached a stable, usable state—and I decided to release it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bichon is completely free.&lt;lb/&gt; You can download and use it however you like.&lt;lb/&gt; It’s not perfect, but I hope it brings you value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Pull the image
docker pull rustmailer/bichon:latest

# Create data directory
mkdir -p ./bichon-data

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name bichon \
  -p 15630:15630 \
  -v $(pwd)/bichon-data:/data \
  -e BICHON_LOG_LEVEL=info \
  -e BICHON_ROOT_DIR=/data \
  rustmailer/bichon:latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting from v0.1.4, Bichon changes how &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt; works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt;is not set, Bichon now allows all origins. This makes local testing and simple deployments much easier.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you do set &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt;, then you must explicitly list each allowed origin.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;is not supported and will not work — you must provide exact URLs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a browser accesses Bichon, it will send an &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incoming Origin = the exact address the browser is using&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configured origins = the list you passed to &lt;code&gt;BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Configured origins does not contain the Incoming Origin exactly as a full string match, the browser request will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example debug log:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2025-12-06T23:56:30.422+08:00 DEBUG bichon::modules::rest: CORS: Incoming Origin = "http://localhost:15630"
2025-12-06T23:56:30.422+08:00 DEBUG bichon::modules::rest: CORS: Configured origins = ["http://192.168.3.2:15630"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser is using &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:15630&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;But the configured origin is &lt;code&gt;http://192.168.3.2:15630&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ CORS will fail, and you can immediately see why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is strongly recommended to configure CORS in production environments to ensure that only trusted browser origins can access Bichon. If you want to access Bichon from a browser:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add the exact IP with port&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or the exact hostname with port&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Or the domain (port optional if it's 80)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://192.168.1.16:15630
http://myserver.local:15630
http://mydomain.com
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you access Bichon in multiple different ways, list all of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS="http://192.168.1.16:15630,http://myserver.local:15630,http://mydomain.com"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not add a trailing slash (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://192.168.1.16:15630/&lt;/code&gt;will not match)&lt;p&gt;Do not use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, it is not supported.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set environment variable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BICHON_LOG_LEVEL=debug
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or via command-line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;--bichon-log-level debug
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default is &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt;, so CORS logs will not appear unless debug logging is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Note: If you are running Bichon in a container (via Docker Compose or docker run), be careful with quotes in environment variable values.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, do not write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The outer quotes (&lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;) will be passed literally into the container and may cause CORS misconfiguration.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correct way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-e BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or using YAML literal style for Docker Compose:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;environment:
  BICHON_CORS_ORIGINS: |
    http://localhost:15630,http://myserver.local:15630&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ensures that the configured origins are interpreted correctly inside the container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Note: This fucking problem I actually didn’t know about myself; thanks to gall-1 for pointing it out.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;--bichon-root-dir argument is required and must be an absolute path.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you are accessing Bichon from a proxy domain mydomain argument --bichon-cors-origins="https://mydomain" is required.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the following documentation for detailed instructions on how to set the Bichon encryption password:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👉 https://github.com/rustmailer/bichon/wiki/Setting-the-Bichon-Encryption-Password&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All configuration methods, including command-line options, environment variables, and password file support (v0.2.0+), are documented there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting from Bichon v0.2.0, the authentication model has been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bichon no longer uses the legacy single-account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;root / root&lt;/code&gt;login.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The system now ships with a built-in admin user by default.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Default credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Username: &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Password: &lt;code&gt;admin@bichon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Username: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legacy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;account and the&lt;code&gt;root / root&lt;/code&gt;default credentials no longer exist.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;From v0.2.0 onward, access-token–based authentication is always enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The startup flag and environment variable &lt;code&gt;--bichon-enable-access-token&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;BICHON_ENABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;are deprecated and no longer used.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No additional configuration is required to enable authentication.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After logging in, the admin user can manage their profile directly in the WebUI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Log in to the WebUI using the default admin credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Navigate to Settings → Profile.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Username&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Password&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Avatar and other profile information&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you already have existing emails stored as EML or MBOX files, you can import them into Bichon using the &lt;code&gt;bichonctl&lt;/code&gt; CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Index historical emails&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform full-text search immediately&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manage imported data just like synced IMAP emails&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We have collected a real-world case study from a user processing email data, which demonstrates Bichon's performance and storage efficiency in a live environment. This case involves ingesting and indexing data from 126 email accounts. The total original data volume was 229 GB, comprising 460,000 emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A special thank you to @rallisf1 for sharing this usage scenario and the detailed data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data is provided solely as a reference for real-world usage. We encourage more users to share their Bichon usage screenshots and metrics (e.g., ingestion volume, compression ratio, search speed, etc.) to help the community conduct a more comprehensive assessment of Bichon's suitability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;Sync on demand&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Sync a single folder&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Verify completeness by comparing with the mail server&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + ShadCN UI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Core Engine (Storage &amp;amp; Search): Tantivy &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Acts as both the primary storage for email content and the full-text search index. This unified approach ensures high performance and eliminates data redundancy.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metadata Storage: Native_DB &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Used exclusively for lightweight configuration and account metadata.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Email Protocols: IMAP (Supports standard Password &amp;amp; OAuth2)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To build or contribute to Bichon, the following environment is recommended:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust: Use the latest stable toolchain for best compatibility and performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js: Version 20+ is required.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pnpm: Recommended package manager for the WebUI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/rustmailer/bichon.git
cd bichon&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd web
pnpm install
pnpm run build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the WebUI in development mode if needed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pnpm run dev&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the WebUI is built, return to the project root:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd ..
cargo build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or run directly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export BICHON_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD=dummy-password-for-testing
cargo run -- --bichon-root-dir e:\bichon-data&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--bichon-root-dir&lt;/code&gt; specifies the directory where all Bichon data will be stored.
&lt;code&gt;BICHON_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; is the password used to encrypt the sensitive data (see &lt;code&gt;cargo run -- --help&lt;/code&gt; for alternative ways to specify this).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The WebUI runs on http://localhost:15630 by default.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HTTPS is not enabled in development or default builds.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
