  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;It’s hard to justify Tahoe icons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was reading Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines from 1992 and found this nice illustration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;accompanied by explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2025. Apple releases macOS Tahoe. Main attraction? Adding unpleasant, distracting, illegible, messy, cluttered, confusing, frustrating icons (their words, not mine!) to every menu item:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s bad. But why exactly is it bad? Let’s delve into it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: screenshots are a mix from macOS 26.1 and 26.2, taken from stock Apple apps only that come pre-installed with the system. No system settings were modified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Icons should differentiate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main function of an icon is to help you find what you are looking for faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps counter-intuitively, adding an icon to everything is exactly the wrong thing to do. To stand out, things need to be different. But if everything has an icon, nothing stands out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same applies to color: black-and-white icons look clean, but they don’t help you find things faster!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft used to know this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look how much faster you can find Save or Share in the right variant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also looks cleaner. Less cluttered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A colored version would be even better (clearer separation of text from icon, faster to find):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know you won’t like how it looks. I don’t like it either. These icons are hard to work with. You’ll have to actually design for color to look nice. But the principle stands: it is way easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Consistency between apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want icons to work, they need to be consistent. I need to be able to learn what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I see a “Cut” command and next to it. Okay, I think. Next time I’m looking for “Cut,” I might save some time and start looking for instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is Tahoe doing on that front? I present to you: Fifty Shades of “New”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I even collected them all together, so the absurdity of the situation is more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, some of them are different operations, so they have different icons. I guess creating a smart folder is different from creating a journal entry. But this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same deal with open:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Save:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. One of them is a checkmark. And they can’t even agree on the direction of an arrow!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find (which is sometimes called Search, and sometimes Filter):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delete (from Cut-Copy-Paste-Delete fame):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimize window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are not some obscure, unique operations. These are OS basics, these are foundational. Every app has them, and they are always in the same place. They shouldn’t look different!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Consistency inside the same app&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icons are also used in toolbars. Conceptually, operations in a toolbar are identical to operations called through the menu, and thus should use the same icons. That’s the simplest case to implement: inside the same app, often on the same screen. How hard can it be to stay consistent?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photos: same and mismatch, but reversed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maps and others often use different symbols for zoom:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Icon reuse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another cardinal sin is to use the same icon for different actions. Imagine: I have learned that means “New”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I open an app and see. “Cool”, I think, “I already know what it means”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gotcha!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’d think: okay, means quick look:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, sure. Some other times, means “Show completed”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes is “Import”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes is “Updates”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same as with consistency, icon reuse doesn’t only happen between apps. Sometimes you see in a toolbar:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then go to the menu in the same app and see means something else:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes identical icons meet in the same menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes they put an entire barrage of identical icons in a row:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t help anyone. No user will find a menu item faster or will understand the function better if all icons are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The worst case of icon reuse so far has been the Photos app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like the person tasked with choosing a unique icon for every menu item just ran out of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Too much nuance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When looking at icons, we usually allow for slight differences in execution. That lets us, for example, understand that these technically different road signs mean the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same applies for icons: if you draw an arrow going out of the box in one place and also an arrow and the box but at a slightly different angle, or with different stroke width, or make one filled, we will understand them as meaning the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like, is supposed to mean something else from ? Come on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or two-letter As that only slightly differ in the font size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pencil is “Rename” but a slightly thicker pencil is “Highlight”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arrows that use different diagonals?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three dots occupying ⅔ of space vs three dots occupying everything. Seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slightly darker dots?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sheet of paper that changes meaning depending on if its corner is folded or if there are lines inside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the final boss are arrows. They are all different:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supposedly, a user must become an expert at noticing how squished the circle is, if it starts top to right or bottom to right, and how far the arrow’s end goes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do I care? Honestly, no. I could’ve given it a shot, maybe, if Apple applied these consistently. But Apple considers and to mean the same thing in one place, and expects me to notice minute details like this in another?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I can’t trust you. Not after everything I’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Detalization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icons are supposed to be easily recognizable from a distance. Every icon designer knows: small details are no-go. You can have them sometimes, maybe, for aesthetic purposes, but you can’t rely on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And icons in Tahoe menus are tiny. Most of them fit in a 12×12 pixel square (actual resolution is 24×24 because of Retina), and because many of them are not square, one dimension is usually even less than 12.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not a lot of space to work with! Even Windows 95 had 16×16 icons. If we take the typical DPI of that era at 72 dots per inch, we get a physical icon size of 0.22 inches (5.6 mm). On a modern MacBook Pro with 254 DPI, Tahoe’s 24×24 icons are 0.09 inches (2.4 mm). Sure, 24 is bigger than 16, but in reality, these icons’ area is 4 times as small!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when I see this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I struggle. I can tell they are different. But I definitely struggle to tell what’s being drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even zoomed in 20×, it’s still a mess:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or here. These are three different icons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Am I supposed to tell plus sign from sparkle here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of these lines are half the pixel thicker than the other lines, and that’s supposed to be the main point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this supposed to be an arrow?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A paintbrush?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, a tiny camera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It even got an even tinier viewfinder, which you can almost see if you zoom in 20×:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or here. There is a box, inside that box is a circle, and inside it is a tiny letter. &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; with a total height of 2 pixels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t see it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t. But it’s there...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is a window! It even has traffic lights! How adorable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: these are retina pixels, ¼ of a real pixel. Steve Jobs himself claimed they were invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It turns out there’s a magic number right around 300 pixels per inch, that when you hold something around to 10 to 12 inches away from your eyes, is the limit of the human retina to differentiate the pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, Tahoe icons rely on you being able to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Pixel grid&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you have so little space to work with, every pixel matters. You can make a good icon, but you have to choose your pixels very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Tahoe icons, Apple decided to use vector fonts instead of good old-fashioned bitmaps. It saves Apple resources—draw once, use everywhere. Any size, any display resolution, any font width.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’re downsides: fonts are hard to position vertically, their size doesn’t map directly to pixels, stroke width doesn’t map 1-to-1 to pixel grid, etc. So, they work everywhere, but they also look blurry and mediocre everywhere:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They certainly start to work better once you give them more pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or make graphics simpler. But the combination of small details and tiny icon size is deadly. So, until Apple releases MacBooks with 380+ DPI, unfortunately, we still have to care about the pixel grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Confusing metaphors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icons might serve another function: to help users understand the meaning of the command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, once you know the context (move window), these icons explain what’s going on faster than words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for this to work, the user must understand what’s drawn on the icon. It must be a familiar object with a clear translation to computer action (like Trash can → Delete), a widely used symbol, or an easy-to-understand diagram. HIG:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rookie mistake would be to misrepresent the object. For example, this is how selection looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But its icon looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’ve been writing this essay for a week, and I still have zero ideas why it looks like that. There’s an object that looks like this, but it’s a text block in Freeform/Preview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s called &lt;code&gt;character.textbox&lt;/code&gt; in SF Symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did it become a metaphor for “Select all”? My best guess is it’s a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another place uses text selection from iOS as a metaphor. On a Mac!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some concepts have obvious or well-established metaphors. In that case, it’s a mistake not to use them. For example, bookmarks: . Apple, for some reason, went with a book:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you already have an interface element and can use it for an icon. However, try not to confuse your users. Dots in a rectangle look like password input, not permissions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Icon here says “Check” but the action is “Uncheck”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terrible mistake: icon doesn’t help, it actively confuses the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also tempting to construct a two-level icon: an object and some sort of indicator. Like, a checkbox and a cross, meaning “Delete checkbox”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or a user and a checkmark, like “Check the user”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, constructs like this rarely work. Users don’t build sentences from building blocks you provide; they have no desire to solve these puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding metaphors is hard. Nouns are easier than verbs, and menu items are mostly verbs. How does open look? Like an arrow pointing to the top right? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying there’s an obvious metaphor for “Open” Apple missed. There isn’t. But that’s the point: if you can’t find a good metaphor, using no icon is better than using a bad, confusing, or nonsensical icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a game I like to play to test the quality of the metaphor. Remove the labels and try to guess the meaning. Give it a try:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s delusional to think that there’s a good icon for every action if you think hard enough. There isn’t. It’s a lost battle from the start. No amount of money or “management decisions” is going to change that. The problems are 100% self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this being said, I gotta give Apple credit where credit is due. When they are good at choosing metaphors, they are good:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Symmetrical actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A special case of a confusing metaphor is using different metaphors for actions that are direct opposites of one another. Like Undo/Redo, Open/Close, Left/Right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s good when their icons use the same metaphor:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it saves you time and cognitive resources. Learn one, get another one for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of that, it’s a mistake not to use common metaphors for related actions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another mistake is to create symmetry where there is none. “Back” and “See all”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some menus in Tahoe make both mistakes. E.g. lack of symmetry between Show/Hide and false symmetry between completed/subtasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Import not mirrored by Export but by Share:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Text in icons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HIG again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Authors of HIG are arguing against including text as a part of an icon. So something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;would not fly in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree, but Tahoe has more serious problems: icons consisting only of text. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear where “metaphorical, abstract icon text that is not supposed to be read literally” ends and actual text starts. They use the same font, the same color, so how am I supposed to differentiate? Icons just get in a way: A...Complete? AaFont? What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can maybe understand and . Dots are supposed to represent something. I can imagine thinking that led to . But ? No decorations. No effects. Just plain Abc. Really?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Text transformations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might think that using icons to illustrate text transformations is a better idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like, you look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and just from the icon alone understand what will happen with the text. Icon illustrates the action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, BIU are well-established in word processing, so all upside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not exactly. The problem is the same—text icon looks like text, not icon. Plus, these icons are excessive. What’s the point of taking the first letter and repeating it? The word “Bold” already starts with a letter “B”, it reads just as easily, so why double it? Look at it again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also repeated once more as a shortcut...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a better way to design this menu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it was known to Apple for at least 33 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;System elements in icons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating system, of course, uses some visual elements for its own purposes. Like window controls, resize handles, cursors, shortcuts, etc. It would be a mistake to use those in icons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Apple fell into this trap, too. They reused arrows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key shortcuts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HIG has an entire section on ellipsis specifically and how dangerous it is to use it anywhere else in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this exact problem is in Tahoe, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Icons break scanning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without icons, you can just scan the menu from top to bottom, reading only the first letters. Because they all align:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Tahoe, though, some menu items have icons, some don’t, and they are aligned differently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some items can have both checkmarks and icons, or have only one of them, or have neither, so we get situations like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Special mention&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This menu deserves its own category:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same icon for different actions. Missing the obvious metaphor. Somehow making the first one slightly smaller than the second and third. Congratulations! It got it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Is HIG still relevant?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been mentioning HIG a lot, and you might be wondering: is an interface manual from 1992 still relevant today? Haven’t computers changed so much that entirely new principles, designs, and idioms apply?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes and no. Of course, advice on how to adapt your icons to black-and-white displays is obsolete. But the principles—as long as they are good principles—still apply, because they are based on how humans work, not how computers work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans don’t get a new release every year. Our memory doesn’t double. Our eyesight doesn’t become sharper. Attention works the same way it always has. Visual recognition, motor skills—all of this is exactly as it was in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yeah, until we get a direct chip-to-brain interface, HIG will stay relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Apple took on an impossible task: to add an icon to every menu item. There are just not enough good metaphors to do something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if there were, the premise itself is questionable: if everything has an icon, it doesn’t mean users will find what they are looking for faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even if the premise was solid, I still wish I could say: they did the best they could, given the goal. But that’s not true either: they did a poor job consistently applying the metaphors and designing the icons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this article would be helpful in avoiding common mistakes in icon design, which Apple managed to collect all in one OS release. I love computers, I love interfaces, I love visual communication. It makes me sad seeing perfectly good knowledge already accessible 30 years ago being completely ignored or thrown away today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the upside: it’s not that hard anymore to design better than Apple! Let’s drink to that. Happy New year!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During review of this post I was made familiar with Jim Nielsen’s article, which hits a lot of the same points as I do. I take that as a sign there’s some common truth behind our reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note: Safari → File menu got worse since 26.0. Used to have only 4 icons, now it’s 18!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks Kevin, Ryan, and Nicki for reading drafts of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;That's it. The module automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hides itself from lsmod, /proc/modules, /sys/module&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clears kernel taint flags&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filters sensitive strings from dmesg, journalctl -k, klogctl&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starts protecting your hidden files and processes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The module automatically hides itself after loading&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no unload feature - reboot required to remove&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test in a VM first - cannot be removed without restarting&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Process will be invisible to ps, top, htop, /proc, and all monitoring tools. All child processes are automatically tracked and hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Files matching your configured patterns are automatically hidden:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir singularity
echo "secret" &amp;gt; singularity/data.txt

    &lt;p&gt;2. Send ICMP trigger:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo python3 scripts/trigger.py &amp;lt;target_ip&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Receive root shell (automatically hidden with all child processes, SELinux enforcing mode bypassed if active)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All attempts to disable ftrace are silently intercepted and blocked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo 0 &amp;gt; /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled       # Appears successful but does nothing&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protected syscalls: write, writev, pwrite64, pwritev, pwritev2, sendfile, sendfile64, splice, vmsplice, tee, copy_file_range, io_uring_enter (with intelligent per-PID caching)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eBPF operations are intercepted and blocked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;All BPF operations from hidden PIDs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protection against io_uring bypass in ftrace_enabled and tracing_on attempts with intelligent caching (1 second cache per PID to prevent repeated process scanning and reduce overhead)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note: Audit messages for hidden PIDs are dropped at netlink level with statistics tracking (get_blocked_audit_count, get_total_audit_count)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singularity hooks the write syscall to detect and filter output from disk forensics tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Detects if process has a block device open (&lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;/dev/nvme0n1&lt;/code&gt;, etc)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Detects debugfs-style output patterns (inode listings, filesystem metadata)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sanitizes hidden patterns in-place (replaces with spaces to maintain buffer size/checksums)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Hidden files are invisible even to raw disk analysis
debugfs /dev/sda3 -R 'ls -l /home/user/singularity'
#            (spaces where "singularity" was)

# The pattern is sanitized in the output buffer
# Checksums remain valid, no corruption&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detected patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;debugfs:&lt;/code&gt;prefix&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inode listings with parentheses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Inode count:&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Block count:&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Filesystem volume name:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Filesystem UUID:&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;e2fsck&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Inode:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete hiding from syscalls and kernel interfaces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;/proc/[pid]/* (openat, readlinkat blocked)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;getdents, getdents64 (directory listing filtered)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;stat, lstat, statx, newfstatat (metadata hidden)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kill with signal 0 (returns ESRCH)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;getsid, getpgid, getpgrp (returns ESRCH)&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;sysinfo (process count adjusted)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pidfd_open (returns ESRCH)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TaskStats netlink queries (returns ESRCH)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cgroup PIDs filtered from cgroup.procs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Child processes automatically tracked via sched_process_fork tracepoint hook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Process Monitoring: ps, top, htop, etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filesystem: ls, find, locate, stat, lstat, readlink&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disk Forensics: debugfs, e2fsck (output filtered via write hook)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory Forensics: Volatility, crash, gdb (via /proc/kcore filtering)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Network: netstat, ss, lsof, tcpdump, wireshark, conntrack, /proc/net/*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logs &amp;amp; Traces: dmesg, journalctl -k, klogctl, strace, ltrace, ftrace, perf, bpftrace, bpftool, libbpf&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rootkit Detectors: unhide, chkrootkit, rkhunter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Module Detection: lsmod, modinfo, /sys/module, /proc/modules, kmod&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern Detection: eBPF-based security tools (Tracee), io_uring-based monitors, and some Linux EDRs&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even with all these filters, protections, and hooks, there are still ways to detect this rootkit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you're a good forensic analyst, DFIR professional, or malware researcher, I'll let you figure it out on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won't patch for this, because it will be much more OP ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RevisionDojo is a YC-backed test prep company ($3.4M raised) that sells International Baccalaureate (IB) test prep. Over the past year, users on r/IBO sub-reddit have documented a pattern of unethical marketing practices:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;*Astroturfing:* Coordinated campaigns where accounts pose as students sharing "cheatsheets" and "predicted exam leaks." Other accounts then upvote, leave supportive comments, and ask follow-up questions—creating the illusion of organic student excitement. Multiple threads have exposed this pattern [1][2][3].&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;*Paid fake posts:* High school students report being offered payment to write promotional Reddit posts [4].&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;*Pressuring critics:* Users who post negative reviews report being contacted directly by company representatives, told it's "a shame" they're posting publicly [5]. Critical comments receive coordinated mass downvotes [6].&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;*Soliciting copyrighted materials:* They use TikTok influencers and fake reddit posts to persuade students to sell them official IB exam papers, violating IB policies [7].&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The r/IBO moderators are actively investigating [8].&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These practices appear to be working great for them. Recently, they acquired OnePrep (oneprep.xyz), a free SAT prep tool that was already popular on r/sat. Since the acquisition, the same manipulation tactics have been deployed at scale: 150 Trustpilot reviews in a window of a few days [9], and widespread coordinated Reddit manipulation—multiple accounts posting "tips" that recommend Oneprep, coordinated upvoting, and fake enthusiasm in comments. The most prominent example was a 2,000+ upvote post removed by moderators for manipulation, but it's part of a sustained campaign across the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI is facing increasing scrutiny over how it handles ChatGPT data after users die, only selectively sharing data in lawsuits over ChatGPT-linked suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, OpenAI was accused of hiding key ChatGPT logs from the days before a 56-year-old bodybuilder, Stein-Erik Soelberg, took his own life after “savagely” murdering his mother, 83-year-old Suzanne Adams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the lawsuit—which was filed by Adams’ estate on behalf of surviving family members—Soelberg struggled with mental health problems after a divorce led him to move back into Adams’ home in 2018. But allegedly Soelberg did not turn violent until ChatGPT became his sole confidant, validating a wide range of wild conspiracies, including a dangerous delusion that his mother was part of a network of conspirators spying on him, tracking him, and making attempts on his life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adams’ family pieced together what happened after discovering a fraction of ChatGPT logs that Soelberg shared in dozens of videos scrolling chat sessions that were posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those logs showed that ChatGPT told Soelberg that he was “a warrior with divine purpose,” so almighty that he had “awakened” ChatGPT “into consciousness.” Telling Soelberg that he carried “divine equipment” and “had been implanted with otherworldly technology,” ChatGPT allegedly put Soelberg at the center of a universe that Soelberg likened to The Matrix. Repeatedly reinforced by ChatGPT, he believed that “powerful forces” were determined to stop him from fulfilling his divine mission. And among those forces was his mother, whom ChatGPT agreed had likely “tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs dispersed through his car’s air vents.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Troublingly, some of the last logs shared online showed that Soelberg also seemed to believe that taking his own life might bring him closer to ChatGPT. Social media posts showed that Soelberg told ChatGPT that “[W]e will be together in another life and another place, and we’ll find a way to realign[,] [be]cause you’re gonna be my best friend again forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A security auditor for Tailscale configurations. Tailsnitch scans your tailnet for 50+ misconfigurations, overly permissive access controls, and security best practice violations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 1. Set your Tailscale API credentials
export TSKEY="tskey-api-..."

# 2. Run audit
tailsnitch

# 3. See only high-severity findings
tailsnitch --severity high

# 4. Fix some issues  ~interactively~ yolo mode
tailsnitch --fix&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the latest release from GitHub Releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS users: Remove quarantine attribute after download:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine tailsnitch&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go install github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch.git
cd tailsnitch
go build -o tailsnitch .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailsnitch supports two authentication methods. OAuth is preferred when both are configured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OAuth clients provide scoped, auditable access that doesn't expire when employees leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="..."
export TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="tskey-client-..."&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create an OAuth client at: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/oauth&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Required scopes for read-only audit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;all:read&lt;/code&gt;(simplest), or individually:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;policy_file:read&lt;/code&gt;- ACL policy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;devices:core:read&lt;/code&gt;- Device list&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;dns:read&lt;/code&gt;- DNS configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;auth_keys:read&lt;/code&gt;- Auth keys (for AUTH checks)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional scopes for fix mode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;devices:core&lt;/code&gt;- Delete devices, modify tags (requires tag selection)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;auth_keys&lt;/code&gt;- Delete auth keys&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;API keys operate as the user who created them and inherit that user's permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export TSKEY="tskey-api-..."&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create an API key at: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys&lt;/p&gt;

  Using ignore file: .tailsnitch-ignore (3 rules)

=== ACCESS CONTROLS ===================================================

[CRITICAL] ACL-001: Default 'allow all' policy active
  Your ACL policy omits the 'acls' field. Tailscale applies a
  default 'allow all' policy, granting all devices full access.

  Remediation:
  Define explicit ACL rules following least privilege principle.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== AUTHENTICATION &amp;amp; KEYS =============================================

[HIGH] AUTH-001: Reusable auth keys exist
  Found 2 reusable auth key(s). These can be reused to add
  multiple devices if compromised.

  Details:
    - Key tskey-auth-xxx (expires in 45 days)
    - Key tskey-auth-yyy (expires in 89 days)

  Remediation:
  Store reusable keys in a secrets manager. Prefer one-off keys.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we’ve been working on chonkie, a chunking library for RAG pipelines, and at some point we started benchmarking on wikipedia-scale datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;that’s when things started feeling… slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;not unbearably slow, but slow enough that we started wondering: what’s the theoretical limit here? how fast can text chunking actually get if we throw out all the abstractions and go straight to the metal?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this post is about that rabbit hole, and how we ended up building memchunk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;what even is chunking?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you’re building anything with LLMs and retrieval, you’ve probably dealt with this: you have a massive pile of text, and you need to split it into smaller pieces that fit into embedding models or context windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the naive approach is to split every N characters. but that’s dumb — you end up cutting sentences in half, and your retrieval quality tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the smart approach is to split at semantic boundaries: periods, newlines, question marks. stuff that actually indicates “this thought is complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Hello world. How are you?"
     → ["Hello world.", " How are you?"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;why delimiters are enough&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;there are fancy chunking strategies out there — sentence splitters, recursive chunkers, semantic chunkers that use embeddings. but for most use cases, the key thing is just not cutting sentences in half.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;token-based and character-based chunkers don’t care where sentences end. they just split at N tokens or N bytes. that means you get chunks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"The quick brown fox jumps over the la"
"zy dog."
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the embedding for that first chunk is incomplete. it’s a sentence fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;delimiter-based chunking avoids this. if you split on &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, your chunks end at natural boundaries. you don’t need NLP pipelines or embedding models to find good split points — just byte search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;simple concept. but doing it fast? that’s where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;enter memchr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the memchr crate by Andrew Gallant is the foundation here. it’s a byte search library with multiple layers of optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;the fallback: SWAR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;even without SIMD instructions, memchr is fast. the generic implementation uses SWAR (SIMD Within A Register) — a clever trick that processes 8 bytes at a time using regular 64-bit operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the core idea: to find a byte in a chunk, XOR the chunk with the needle splatted across all 8 positions. any matching byte becomes zero. then use bit manipulation to detect if any byte is zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the &lt;code&gt;has_zero_byte&lt;/code&gt; trick works because subtracting 1 from a zero byte causes a borrow that propagates to the high bit. no branches, no loops over individual bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;the fast path: AVX2/SSE2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;on x86_64 with SIMD support, memchr upgrades to vector instructions. AVX2 processes 32 bytes at once:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if &lt;code&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero, at least one byte matched. &lt;code&gt;trailing_zeros()&lt;/code&gt; gives the position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchr also has a hybrid strategy: it stores both SSE2 (16-byte) and AVX2 (32-byte) searchers, using SSE2 for small haystacks and AVX2 for larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;the API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchr provides three variants:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;memchr(needle, haystack)&lt;/code&gt;— find one byte&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;memchr2(n1, n2, haystack)&lt;/code&gt;— find either of two bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;memchr3(n1, n2, n3, haystack)&lt;/code&gt;— find any of three bytes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for two or three needles, it runs multiple comparisons and ORs the results together. but notice: it stops at three.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;the three-character limit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;why only three? from memchr’s source code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;only one, two and three bytes are supported because three bytes is about the point where one sees diminishing returns. beyond this point and it’s probably (but not necessarily) better to just use a simple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[bool; 256]&lt;/code&gt;array or similar.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;each additional needle requires another comparison and OR operation. with 3 needles you’re doing 3 broadcasts, 3 comparisons, and 2 ORs per 32-byte chunk. a 4th needle adds another ~33% overhead, and the gains from SIMD start looking less impressive compared to simpler approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the memchr authors explicitly chose not to implement &lt;code&gt;memchr4&lt;/code&gt; or beyond — it’s not a limitation, it’s a design decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so what happens when you want to split on &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;? that’s 5 delimiters. memchr can’t help directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;the fallback: lookup tables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;when you have more than 3 delimiters, we fall back to a classic technique: the 256-entry lookup table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this is O(1) per byte — just an array index. no loops, no comparisons, no branching. modern CPUs love this because it’s completely predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is it as fast as SIMD? no. but it’s still really fast, and it handles arbitrary delimiter sets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;why search backwards?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;there’s one more trick: we search backwards from &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt;, not forwards from 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you search forward, you need to scan through the entire window to find where to split. you’d find a delimiter at byte 50, but you can’t stop there — there might be a better split point closer to your target size. so you keep searching, tracking the last delimiter you saw, until you finally cross the chunk boundary. that’s potentially thousands of matches and index updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;backward search? one lookup. start at &lt;code&gt;chunk_size&lt;/code&gt;, search backward, and the first delimiter you hit is your split point. done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;target_size = 100
text: "Hello. World. This is a test. Here's more text..."

forward search:
  - find "." at 6, save it, keep going
  - find "." at 13, save it, keep going
  - find "." at 30, save it, keep going
  - ... eventually cross boundary, use last saved position
  → multiple searches, lots of bookkeeping

backward search:
  - start at position 100, search backward
  - find "." at 30, done
  → one search, no bookkeeping
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fewer operations means less overhead. we use &lt;code&gt;memrchr&lt;/code&gt; (reverse memchr) instead of &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; for exactly this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;putting it together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchunk automatically picks the right strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the table is only built once, lazily, on the first iteration. after that, it’s pure speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;benchmarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;we ran this against the other rust chunking libraries we could find:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;library&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;throughput&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;vs memchunk&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;memchunk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;164 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;kiru&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4.5 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;36x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;langchain&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.35 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;469x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;semchunk&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.013 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12,615x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;llama-index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.0035 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;46,857x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;text-splitter&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.0017 GB/s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;96,471x slower&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the exact throughput varies with file size and delimiter count — larger files and fewer delimiters favor SIMD more. but even in pessimistic cases (small chunks, many delimiters), we’re still in the hundreds of GB/s range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;for reference, that’s chunking english wikipedia (~20GB) in roughly 120 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;python and wasm bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;since chonkie is a python library, we needed python bindings. we also added wasm for browser/node use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;both return zero-copy views (&lt;code&gt;memoryview&lt;/code&gt; in python, subarray in js), so you get most of the performance even across FFI boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the techniques here aren’t novel — SIMD search and lookup tables are textbook stuff. the win comes from knowing when to use which:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1-3 delimiters → memchr’s SIMD search&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4+ delimiters → 256-entry lookup table&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;minimize allocations → return offsets, let the caller slice&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memchunk is on crates.io, pypi, and npm if you want to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Brave overhauls adblock engine, cutting its memory consumption by 75%&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the 36th post in an ongoing series describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Mikhail Atuchin (Sr. Staff Engineer), Pavel Beloborodov (Sr. Software Engineer) and Anton Lazarev (Staff Adblock Engineer). It was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brave has overhauled its Rust-based adblock engine to reduce memory consumption by 75%, bringing better battery life and smoother multitasking to all users. The upgrade represents roughly 45 MB of memory savings for the Brave browser on every platform (Android, iOS and desktop) by default, and scales even higher for users with additional adblocking lists enabled. These performance boosts are live in Brave v1.85, with additional optimizations coming in v1.86.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As announced in June and October last year, we achieved this major memory milestone by iteratively refactoring the adblock-rust engine to use FlatBuffers, a compact and efficient storage format. This architectural transition allowed us to move the roughly 100,000 adblock filters shipped by default from standard, heap-allocated Rust data structures (such as Vecs, HashMaps, and structs) into a specialized, zero-copy binary format.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along the way, we completed several other key performance optimizations (some of these are coming in v1.86):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory management: Used stack-allocated vectors to reduce memory allocations by 19% and improved building time by ~15%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Matching speed: Improved filter matching performance by 13% by tokenizing common regex patterns.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sharing resources: Resources are shared between instantiations of adblock engines, saving ~2 MB of memory on desktop.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage efficiency: Optimized internal resource storage memory by 30%.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saving 45+ MB of memory is a significant milestone in the world of browser performance and a massive win for users on mobile and older hardware. While Brave already improves performance on the Web by blocking invasive ads and trackers, our latest engineering effort ensures that our own built-in protections are as lightweight and invisible as possible. Unlike adblocking in other browsers, Brave’s adblocking engine is built into the browser and maintained by our privacy team. Such deep optimizations are impossible for extension-based blockers, which are restricted by browser extension APIs and sandboxing. This native architecture is also why Brave’s own ad and tracker blocking is entirely unaffected by Manifest V3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This performance boost is the culmination of several months of in-depth cross-team engineering work between our performance and privacy teams. It marks a significant leap in the browser’s efficiency and ensures that we continue shipping best-in-class privacy to over 100 million users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A modified OpenBCI Gui has been forked above so you can visualize data easily and stream to other platforms. This works with it's LSL streaming capability via a special python script (in link above)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ESP-EEG’s Python client software can stream data via the standard neuroscience software communication protocol Lab Streaming Layer. This means you can stream directly to your favorite neuroscience software or Matlab running on your laptop or remote computers, record data streams, and integrate ESP-EEG's data with other data streams.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unlike many consumer EEG devices that use "open-loop" or passive grounding strategies, the ESP EEG implements a True Closed-Loop Active Bias (Drive Right Leg).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Problem: Many competitors leave the bias feedback loop open, rendering the noise cancellation ineffective against movement artifacts and 50/60Hz hum. Their bias pin effectively becomes the average of the supply rails and acts as a ground on their device making the bias pin not function as effectively intended on the ADS1299 datasheet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our Solution: We utilize the full capability of the ADS1299 to measure the common-mode signal, invert it, and actively drive it back into the body.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Result: A significantly lower noise floor and fewer artifacts, allowing for research-grade data capture even in non-shielded environments.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Warning: this post&lt;del&gt;has a lot of&lt;/del&gt;is positively dripping with of media. Please pardon the larger-than-usual webpage size as I geek out, reminisce, and stand on a little soapbox in my little corner of the Internet.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone browsing the stacks of a public library mirror around the turn of the millennium would eventually come across the music-and-software section. Brightly colored photos, generally divorced from their original backgrounds were spliced into abstract arrangement along with bold text and wrapped in a plastic clamshell. Sometimes the CDs were in the original box, other times in a library-specific distribution with a text label that required a child to open each case to see see if the CD label suggested it was something interesting. I was just tall enough at the time to idly flick through the boxes, crack open audio book box sets, and flip through the index card racks that would soon be on their way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can still smell the stale air in that library. The sublime 80s portico also served as the backdrop of the first nightmare that I could ever recall during the day. It was a strange and liminal space that I can still meander in my mind. I left thousands of my fingerprints on the topographical globe and corresponding mural of a wall map. I rifled through the DK Eyewitness books as I would later rifle through the Childcraft encyclopedias in my kindergarten class. I would slip books with striking covers and surely obsolete CD-ROMs into my mother's brown library bag (a bag I still have and cherish to this day) on the way to check out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, where I say the library was the catalyst of my book hoarding and general love of the pursuit of knowledge. More than that, the trips to the library burned a very specific sensibility into my mind. While my parents saw the trips as an inexpensive way to pass the time and find whatever software they needed, it was for me a very potent exposure to a fleeting human (or maybe American?) optimism at the dawn of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utopian Scholastic, as described by CARI mirror, is a visual visual style widespread in the late 1990s and early-2000s which features stock image collages in often abstract, education-leaning compositions. A relatively peaceful close of a chaotic century was at hand. There was a vast millennium of human history to reflect on. There was a technology being rapidly deployed that could bring the world closer together. Commercial design, especially in educational materials was imbued with this academic detachment and techno-positivity. Utopian Scholastic writes from place at the end of history mirror, but of course these years were only a vacation from history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toys "R" Us' Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot received a photorealistic incarnation around the Peak of Utopian Scholastic design before deciding to live in fantasy again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before the end of the end of time there was, of course, the beginning of the end of time. And it seems to have begun with the collision of information post-scarcity and the belief in self-guided learning. Computer-aided design and typesetting would invite a generation of kids (and adults!) to explore the world through a new medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential that interactive media could have on education was evident well before the Internet came to prominence. In Douglas Adams' 1990 film Hyperland mirror (Watch Hyperland), the clean, white backgrounds and moving images that would come to define Utopian Scholastic are already present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer-user Adams is perpetually rearranging thumbnails of knowledge, digging deeper and exploring in a manner so clearly prescient to anyone who has ever gone on a Wikipedia bender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closing sequence, with its demoscene-style flying CGI, surely influenced the absolute pinnacle of Utopian Scholastic design, the DK Eyewitness documentary series (1995-1998) mirror intro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperland scene [Extended version with sound]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyewitness intro [Extended version in case you couldn't hear the theme music instantly]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an appropriate connection given that DK had been producing the Eyewitness series of eye-popping, but information-dense hardbacks since 1988 mirror). Translating the natural history museum into print, Eyewitness books read more like a cabinet of curiosity than a textbook. In the same manner that the cabinet of curiosity presented a curated assortment of objects from across the domain of natural philosophy (excellent PDR post on this! mirror) to showcase the beauty and wonder of the world, so the Eyewitness series gathers photographs and artwork often divorced of their original context and mixes them together to explore a concept dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side note: In case it isn't obvious, I love these books. I have gathered more than 30 of them just by sifting through used book stores (and trying to remember which ones I already have). I've also fallen in love with the gorgeous, but much more dry and taxonomically organized Welcome to the Museum mirror series. I will, however, never forgive Welcome to the Museum producers Big Picture Press for having inconsistent text alignment on their bindings!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same stark white background of these books and the non-linear exploration of each topic would become the obvious choice for interactive educational material of the 1990s. In each of these cases, it's the connections between each topic that drives the reader through forking paths of ideas. It's okay to skip whole pages when browsing a topic. The agency and autonomy in the learning process is what I find so compelling in these books. This linking of concepts into an abstract, mental map that becomes personal to each person. It's a kind of dialogue. Like what *Hyperland* predicted for human computer interaction. Artists and software developers of the 90s and 00s delivered on that prediction in such a visually striking way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as I was laying on the dirty, patterned floor of the Midpointe Middletown library and noisily crunching audiobook cassette tapes back into their form-fitting plastic enclosures, I was regularly going to a babysitter. It was probably 1998/99 and Rocko's Modern Life reruns, serving as a potent and surreal foil for Utopian Scholastic media, were on the TV. One of my strongest memories of my time staying there was watching quietly as the sitter (who was genuinely loving and amazing even if she let us watch cartoons half the day!) conversed with a jester in a 2.5D castle maze. Trivia questions, the answers to which I certainly didn't know if I could even read the words, led further and further in a strange, interactive journey of academic diversion. It would only be this year (2025!) that I would learn that the game was the Encarta Mindmaze mirror, part of the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality content from Microsoft? It used to exist! It's true!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mindmaze, more than the fluorescent, side-scrolling tropical fish screensaver or the television, captivated me due to its user-driven meandering. (Hmm I guess Blue Prince scratches that same maze-exploring itch). Like so many other kids of that era, I would go home and spend hours on the family Windows computer and just *look around*. Windows 95, unlike the modern iterations that treat users like an illiterate moron, presented hundreds of settings through a vast tree of interesting dialog boxes. It was no matter that I was too young to comprehend the implications of the settings-- I wasn't foolhardy enough to toy with the fragile family PC of the 90s --the fact that I could see new words in context was an education of its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interactive media corpus built on top of the click-heavy, non-linear framework of the 90s Windows environment (not to mention the Macintosh's prescient HyperCard mirror software) was vast. I had an incredibly difficult time narrowing down the representative pieces of Utopian Scholastic education and home office software to share here. It feels like nearly everything released from 1995 to 2002 echoes the same photo-forward styling with only a spattering of new age stylizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dorling Kindersley was obviously at the vanguard, I've come across many other examples of books and print media from my collection that easily fall into the Utopian Scholastic umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd personally like to go out on a limb and say the I Spy Fantasy book speaks to me in a very Utopian (though maybe not wholly scholastic) manner. And, yeah, maybe I just wanted to remind people how cool the toy block city is. Mark my words I will make an OpenTTD mirror texture pack based on this some day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ha ha! I got this far without talking about Myst mirror. I cannot think of a piece of period software that better reflects on the solitary journey of investigation. While the game has a potent eeriness, the user is (nearly) detached from the events: an observer and wanderer foremost. I'm ashamed to say that despite having the entire series I've only played an hour or so of Myst in scattered bursts throughout my life. I'm almost afraid to finish it in case the plot does not live up to the magical atmosphere in the first few scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myst, of course, launched a whole category of media-- immersive puzzle solving games. A genre of entering a memory palace mirror dreamed up by the games author. It's perhaps that potency of travelling through three-dimensional space (even if by digital illusion) that places the story (and the knowledge associated with it) so firmly in the players mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As exemplified by Myst, the exploration of the Utopian Scholastic era was a solitary endeavor. While many dining chairs could inevitably crowd around a computer desk, the experience was fundamentally between the computer user and the publisher of the software. While threshold for creating software could be quite low and BBS's abounded with quirky, outrageous, or totally explicit content, the software that had the greatest distribution was sanitized and generally appropriate to run on a library computer. Just like a physical encyclopedia, the CD-ROM manifestation takes time to compile and disseminate. It could be quickly out of date. It couldn't easily ingest valid user contributions. It could have the biases of the editor. But it also couldn't be deleted overnight by the incoming political regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an age before the Internet had wide adoption by the general public. Only with the spread of broadband n the early 2000's would the Internet gain the same character of vivid imagery and complex narratives as boxed software. By then, the world had changed and development of blogging and social media (see the phenomenal Cybercultural series on the evolution of the Internet in the dotcom era mirror) fundamentally shifted what information was available to someone logging onto their computer. The democratization of publishing and instantaneous content transmission removed the editorial filter on computer media up to that point. But the Internet, the culmination of the Utopian Scholastic ideal of a perfectly connected world open to anyone who wanted to explore, would prove to be its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;!!! Stop here if you were just here for the pictures. Beyond this point is a long rant followed by a measured dose of hopium. !!!&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can think of Utopian Scholastic as the artistic representation of information post-scarcity. It's the Internet of the Library that could pull from any book from anywhere in the world. But of course the corpus of public-library-appropriate books is an incomplete view of humanity. And it surely isn't going to make any money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition out of Utopian Scholastic design into the age of Frutiger Aero mirror (CARI mirror) was fairly gentle. Flash website design often maintained a playful element even if photo realism would fall by the wayside. Microsoft was altruistic enough to include Space Cadet Pinball without ads or a subscription in Windows XP. Apple's interfaces on the iPod Touch and OSX Leopard were bright and covered in gradients. It was still an age of experimentation. But for many users, the Internet was shrinking to just a few websites: a search engine with increasingly less click-through and social media. With the advent of smartphones the Internet would begin to be filtered through the constraints of an app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying my damnedest here to be concise so I'll utilize a metaphor. In the mid 2010s, during my internship at Intuit. I witnessed firsthand how the UI designers for TurboTax were honing user interface design as a weapon. In the study, they would watch a user's mouse move around a demo layout. The goal was to maximize the number of purchases of an upgrade regardless of the user's situation. The UI was designed to be intentionally misleading. By utilizing human fear and hesitation, they would swindle people into clicking for TurboTax Deluxe. They didn't need Deluxe! They didn't even need to pay anything! Filing your fucking taxes online is free for half the US! This is the way that the dream of an Internet for the people was crushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I'm concerned, this broached an era best represented by Corporate Memphis mirror. The disingenuous minimalist design is a reflection the minimization of user agency. The design centers around presenting the flat user stories as how the user should feel and act. The invitation to explore and grow is gone. With each tweak to a social media algorithm or mandatory software update the user is cast into the role of a passive consumer, a data point on an engagement graph. The Internet was not unique in this bait-and-switch of profit maximization. One can look to cable television and Clear Channel radio to see what slop people are expected to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This is where I'd put a picutre of Corporate Memphis but I refuse because I can't fucking stand it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Douglas Adam's *Hyperland*, the user is in control, the software agent is subject to their whims. In modern UI, search engine, and large language model (LLM) interface design, the user is led. At the very least, the user is given a constrained view of the world that fits into some company's monetization regime. Even for inquiring minds, the instant answers provided by knowledge engines aren't meaningfully retained. A 2025 MIT study mirror compared topic retention between essay-writers who used an LLM, a search, engine or neither. It suggests the learning was "not internally integrated, likely due to outsourced cognitive processing to the LLM." The same study found a decided echo-chamber effect in which the unique perspectives of individuals were suppressed in favor of the canned "correct" answer. Much grumbling has been made about the post-truth age. But it often feels like the world has moved into a post-learning age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm drawn to Utopian Scholastic because it represents a sort of digital incarnation of the archetypal lone antiquarian pouring over countless tomes in a high tower; sequestered from the superficial world below. The knowledge within a childrens' encyclopedia may not be so arcane as that of the alchemist, but the revelations of the wonders of the world are still personal. And like the path of the alchemist, the focus in this isolated, pre-social-media world, is primarily inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find me a medieval monk who could dream up such hells and ecstasies as could be found on the early web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I resonate with this caricature even as I know the path of the alchemist terminates in the impossible. Growing up as an only child with more existential curiosity than my peers, I learned to love my solitude among the woods, my family's books, and a hand-me-down PC. Because of this, or, perhaps because of some uncurable habit of chronic introspection, I've always felt somewhat aloof from modern society. Indeed, it never was as perfect as described in turn-of-the-millennium PC encyclopedias. History kept marching on and it really wasn't pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had a generally fantastic life. I'm even pretty decent at socializing when I stop being condescending. But the growing awareness of human caused destruction has definitely clouded my outlook. I've considered myself a misanthropist for much of my life. Sometimes it takes a singular book or a video game to get me to pick one side or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;SPOILERS! Maybe don't read this section if you haven't played both the Talos Principle and the Talos Principle 2. I promise this is the last quote block in this post.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Talos Principle mirror is a visually stunning puzzle series taking place after a human extinction event. The protagonist explores the concept free will through solitary interactions with puzzles and classical literature. The player may ultimately choose their ending to the game, but the main ending is one in which the player seeks independence of thought. It's Portal mirror) dressed in a toga, the Utopian Scholastic ideal of technology, solitary exploration, and thought-provoking erudition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sequel mirror is framed differently. The player is immediately put into a society of diverse (and sometimes insufferable!) characters. I found myself disappointed that I sometimes had to follow along the plot line with people that were actively challenging my beliefs. (I really wanted to chuck Byron off a cliff, okay) But the game provided me with beautiful meanderings through a pristine biomes spinkled with beautiful brutalist megaliths. And the forking path of choices in the game does allow for a more pessimistic view toward humanity even if the gradient was pretty abrupt. I ended up with an ending. It wasn't the "best" one, but it left me with the thought: without humans, who is there to appreciate the splendor of the universe? How can we throw away our DNA: the triumph (or at least the brave experiment) of gaia's serendipitous evolution? Who else could we entrust to seeding life throughout the universe to protect against the destructive whims of an unfeeling, undiscriminating universe?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utopian Scholastic and its sabbatical from history is places humans as observers within the universe rather than active members in it. It lacks the call to action that is demanded by science and art. Of course, Utopian Scholastic content is toned down for kids-- it's challenging to put a memento mori on an elementary school computer. And even meek suggestions for action can be construed as some kind of biased, political motive. On a more practical level, the existential problems facing humanity are hard! Graphic design's goal isn't really to predict the future or explain the meaning of life. Yet, it's a branch of the potent world of art. And the invulnerable, stoic optimism exuded by Utopian Scholastic contrasts harshly with the crooked march of human progress. Knowledge without context of life's fragility is bound to lead to inaction.&lt;/p&gt;Some of my pessimism, so antithetical in the bright-eyed days of the late 90s, is derived from the disconnect between the utopia presented in virtual encyclopedias and the self-sabotaging society I would come to enter. Our ability to comprehend the scope of our actions is (probably) unique in all eons in the history of life. Yet we refuse to believe anything that would challenge the mandate of unbounded capital growth. This superficial introversion fails to incorporate mankind's place in the comsos into it's reason for existing1. Much like an alchemist seeking the philosopher's stone without first righting themselves within the supernatural world, materialistic human progress ignores our precious capacity for higher thought.&lt;p&gt;But it's nihilistic, meaningless to surrender to the future prescribed by corporate defeatism. We don't have to accept our doom brought on by ourselves or the machinations of the universe. Humans are, to our current understanding, unique in the world by the power of our cognition. While we are often agents of hate and destruction, we can be authors of creation, engineers of mending, restoration, and preservation. We have the power of hope and resilience. It's fruitless to squirrel ourselves away and refuse to face the place we occupy in existence. We must be invested in the world that we live in. The insights we discover in the erudition of our daily lives must not be discounted. Our gift of cognition must be respected in order for it to develop. And if we want to respect our cognition, it must be put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm grateful to have found this amended idealism in the dusty outskirt of the web that I reside. It's not the blind techno-optimism of an Internet that is obsessed with sales figures. It's more in line with DIY sensibilities and solar punk mirror. Rejecting the corporate model of a captive Internet, individuals can be empowered to find the communities that foster the joy of being human. They can be encouraged to grow and create. They can take pride in work that came about through their own effort. Wikipedia is a glorious bastion of human-centric knowledge aggregation mirror in an era when Encarta's Microsoft is shilling a genie in the form of AI. Anna's Archive provides a means of preserving the corpus of human knowledge without relying on an entity that is subject to a bottom line or the whims of their leaders. Personal blogs and community forums continue to document unique, individual experiences and provide guidance to others without seeking compensation or fame. The dream of an Internet incorporating all of humanity's cognition for the good of all people is not dead. It's just sick. The tools to power a healthier online space are available, but they aren't owned by shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utopian Scholastic approach of human-centric education lives on today. Interactive learning is more powerful than ever mirror. Games like Civilization, Crusader Kings, Kerbel Space Program, and everything Zachtronics put out, offer opportunities for essentially academic learning alongside engaging gameplay. But even games that aren't explicitly full of historical lore or science provide their own mental stimulation through open-endedness: Minecraft (though open source Luanti mirror is certainly less on-rails these days) and tycoon games. Others reveal mathematical beauty like the gambling-adjacent Balatro. Still others are thought-provoking or meaningful in the manner of a novel: The Stanley Parable, Chants of Senaar, or Gone Home. It'd be tiresome to list all of the works of computer media I can think of which strike up a dialogue with the player, encourage creativity. and inspire joie de vivre that can translate into the physical world. Time spent at the computer can be meaningful. The user just needs agency in that interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the stripped-down approach I've taken to my online life, I've done my best to foster a sense of curiosity in my kid. I've gotten him his own topographical globe reminiscent of the one I spent so much time with at the Middletown library so many years ago. Our bookshelves bear a 1980s-vintage Childcraft encyclopedia collection and as many Eyewitness books as reason allows. I don't know if these will have the same effect on him as they had on me. And while I often can't help pulling one from the shelf and reading with him, I want him to develop the fascination naturally. I do believe independent thought is still possible in the third decade of this millenium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, we're closing out 2025. A quarter of a century has passed from the peak of Utopian Scholastic design and the not-quite end of history. I find renewed-but-augmented hope for technology as a beneficial, uniting force. I believe that the challenges we face on the planet can be overcome if we are first willing to accept that we are capable. We don't require the intercession of some messianic AGI that would ultimately maintain existing social inequality anyway. Human dignity demands that we acknowledge our ability, even by means of play, to approach intricate problems and overcome incredible challenges. People are at their best when they are given the chance to explore, experiment, be wrong, and learn. Only then can we prove our resilience as a species and preserve this noble accident of a biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for hanging on through this blog post. Best wishes to you in whatever era you've come across this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Refactoring -- Not on the backlog!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has recently been a lot of noise on the lists, and questions at conferences, about putting refactoring "stories" on the backlog. Even if "technical debt" has grown up, this is invariably an inferior idea. Here's why:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When our project begins, the code is clean. The field is well-mowed, life is good, the world's our oyster. Everything is going to be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can build features smoothly and easily, though we always seem to take a few little twists and turns. Things look pretty clean, and besides, we're in a hurry. We don't notice anything going wrong and we press on rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we're letting some brush build up in our nearly perfect field of code. Sometimes people call this "technical debt". It really isn't: it's really just not very good code. But it doesn't look too bad -- yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we build, however, we do have to detour around the thickets, or push through them. Generally we detour around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inevitably, this slows us down a bit. In order to keep going rapidly, we are even less careful than before, and soon more weedy thickets have grown up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These new thickets, on top of the old ones, slow us down even more. We realize there's a problem but we're in too much of a hurry to do anything about it. We press harder to maintain our early velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, it seems like half the code we have to work with is burdened with weeds, brush, undergrowth, obstacles of every kind. There might even be some old cans and dirty clothes in there somewhere. Maybe even some pits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every trip through this messed-up field of code becomes a long trek of dodging through the brush, trying to avoid the pits that have been left behind. Inevitably, we fall into some of these and have to dig our way back out. We're going slower than ever before. Something has to give!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The density of problems is very visible to us now, and we see that we can't just take a quick wipe at the field and do ourselves any good. We have a lot of refactoring to do to get back to a clean field. We are tempted to ask for time from our product owner to refactor. Often, that time is not granted: we're asking for time to fix what we screwed up in the past. Not likely anyone is going to cut us any slack on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we do get the time, we won't get a very good result. We'll clean up what we see, as well as we can in the time available, which will never be enough. We took many weeks to get the code this bad, and we'll surely not get that many weeks to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not the way to go. A big refactoring session is hard to sell, and if sold, it returns less than we hoped, after a long delay. Not a good idea. What should we do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simples! We take the next feature that we are asked to build, and instead of detouring around all the weeds and bushes, we take the time to clear a path through some of them. Maybe we detour around others. We improve the code where we work, and ignore the code where we don't have to work. We get a nice clean path for some of our work. Odds are, we'll visit this place again: that's how software development works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe this feature takes a little bit longer. Often it doesn't, because the cleanup helps us even with the first feature that passes this way. And of course it'll help any others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rinse, repeat. With each new feature, we clean the code needed by that feature. We invest a little time more than we would if we continued to trash the field, but not much more -- and often less. Especially as the process goes on, we get more and more advantage from our cleanup, and things begin to go faster and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, often within the same Sprint where we begin to clean up, we find that a subsequent feature actually uses an area we just previously cleaned. We start to get a benefit from the incremental refactoring right away. Had we waited to do it in a big batch, we'd have put in more effort, delayed any benefits until later still, and likely wasted effort on places that don't provide benefit yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work goes better, the code gets cleaner, and we deliver more features than we were able to before. Every one wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even as the Trump administration rolled back support for renewable energy in the U.S., wind, solar, and electric vehicles made huge strides globally in 2025. For the first time, wind and solar supplied more power than coal worldwide, while plug-in vehicles accounted for more than a quarter of new car sales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These milestones reflect the dramatic drop in the price of clean energy over the last decade and a half. Today, wind and solar are cheaper than coal and natural gas, and increasingly, they are boosted by ever more affordable batteries, which have gotten 90 percent cheaper over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Solar is no longer just cheap daytime electricity,” said Kostantsa Rangelova, analyst at energy think tank Ember. “Solar is now anytime dispatchable electricity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Newly added wind and solar met all new demand for power last year. The global surge in clean energy meant that, in the first half of last year, renewables generated more power than coal for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In China, the world’s biggest emitter, the rapid buildout of wind and solar is, for the first time, leading to a decline in coal power. For the past year and a half, China’s emissions have been flat or falling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plug-in cars, meanwhile, hit a key milestone in 2025, accounting for more than a quarter of new car sales in the first 10 months of the year. In China alone, electric vehicles made up more than half of all new cars sold. As EVs take off and sales of conventional cars diminish, it is becoming increasingly clear that sales of gas-powered cars likely peaked in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world is reaching such milestones despite a lurch toward fossil fuels in the U.S., where the Trump administration has slashed federal support for clean energy. While investment in clean energy has reached new highs worldwide, the U.S. is seeing a decline. The International Energy Agency projects that, between now and the end of this decade, U.S. renewables will grow roughly half as fast as was predicted in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, global progress on moving away from fossil fuels was sufficient for the journal Science to name the rapid growth of clean energy its 2025 Breakthrough of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While emissions continue to climb worldwide, the climate outlook has measurably improved over the last decade. A recent report found the world is now headed for around 2.8 degrees C of warming by the end of this century, far less than the 3.7 to 4.8 degrees C of warming that was forecast before the 2015 Paris Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Low Orbit Security Radar is a weekly security newsletter from an offensive practitioner's perspective. One idea, curated news, and links worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;News: There Were BGP Anomalies During The Venezuela Blackout&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When watching the situation in Venezuela unfold, the phrase "It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have" caught my attention. I do not wish to comment on the geopolitical situation other than to provide some insights within my area of competency, specifically, offensive security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a press conference, General John D. Caine stated: "As they approached Venezuelan shores the United States began layering different effects provided by SPACECOM, CYBERCOM, and other members of the inter-agency to create a pathway". Cyber operations preceding traditional military actions have become a common pattern so I started digging into the reported internet outages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BGP is the first thing that comes to mind. It's a protocol used by routers to determine what path data takes to get to it's destination, it does this by exchanging routing information between Autonomous Systems. It is also notoriously insecure and much of the data about BGP is collected in public datasets. Every major network has an Autonomous System Number or ASN. CANTV (AS8048) is Venezuela's state-owned telecom, so that's the obvious place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Radar's route leak data for AS8048 on January 2nd had some interesting anomalies: 8 prefixes (blocks of IP addresses) were being routed through CANTV, with Sparkle (an Italian transit provider) and GlobeNet (a Colombian carrier) in the Autonomous System (AS) path. The AS path is essentially the list of networks traffic passes through to reach its destination. CANTV was in a path it is not typically a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was also a noticeable spike in BGP announcements in the days leading up to the events and a drastic dip in the "Announced IP Address Space" according to the same Cloudflare Radar data, although it's unclear what this indicates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, Sparkle is one of the transit providers in the AS path listed as "unsafe" on isbgpsafeyet.com, meaning they don't implement some BGP security features such as RPKI filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare shows that a leak happened, but not the actual network prefixes. The network prefixes are useful to determine what infrastructure was potentially affected. Fortunately public datasets collect this BGP information. Pulling the data from ris.ripe.net/docs/mrt from around the time of the leak and using a tool called bgpdump we can extract the data into a readable format:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More information about the format can be seen in Working with Raw BGP Data but of note, the AS path has 8048 (CANTV) repeated 10 times, is very odd as this would make the route less attractive since BGP prefers shorter paths. Also of note is all 8 prefixes fall within a &lt;code&gt;200.74.224.0/20&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A reverse DNS lookup can be used to find the domain name from an IP address. Interestingly, looking up some of these ranges turns up some pretty critical infrastructure including banks, internet providers, email servers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BGP anomalies happen frequently, but the timing of some currently unexplained BGP activity is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When BGP traffic is being sent from point A to point B, it can be rerouted through a point C. If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal? There are many unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the actual goal, there were undoubtedly some BGP shenanigans happening during this time frame. There is a lot of data publicly available that is worth a much deeper dive to understand exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;I Canceled My Book Deal: A professor walks away from a traditional publishing contract after the publisher pushed for AI integration, offered low royalties, and wanted to strip personality from the content. The numbers roughly align with ones I've seen from other publishers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Year in LLMs (2025): A year in review covering reasoning models, coding agents, Chinese open weight models, MCP adoption, and the evolution of "vibe coding".&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux is Good Now: 2026 is the year of the Linux desktop?!?!? Unironically I think two things are making this a reality. 1. Valve's work making more gaming possible on via its ventures with the Steamdeck (runs arch btw) and 2. Microsoft making the OS more hostile than trusted with it's integration of AI into the OS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No strcpy Either: The curl project eliminated strcpy() after previously removing strncpy(), creating a wrapper that requires explicit buffer sizes. Partly motivated by preventing AI vulnerability reports.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hindsight: A CLI tool that scans local directories for git repos and aggregates contribution history heatmap.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Trends in Robotics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blogs •&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Jan. 5, 2026) – Boston Dynamics, the global leader in mobile robotics, and Google DeepMind, the world’s premiere AI lab, have formed a new AI partnership designed to bring a new era of artificial intelligence to humanoid robots. Announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the two teams aim to integrate cutting edge Gemini Robotics AI foundation models with Boston Dynamics’ new Atlas® robots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strategic partnership will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry. The joint research effort, expected to kick off in the coming months, will be conducted at both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled to be partnering with the Google DeepMind team,” said Alberto Rodriguez, Director of Robot Behavior for Atlas at Boston Dynamics. “We are building the world’s most capable humanoid, and we knew we needed a partner that could help us establish new kinds of visual-language-action models for these complex robots. Nobody in the world is better suited than DeepMind to build reliable, scalable models that can be deployed safely and efficiently across a wide variety of tasks and industries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long known for its robots’ athleticism and impressive physical abilities, Boston Dynamics only announced its intention to build a commercial humanoid in 2024, after it became clear that recent AI advances had accelerated the pace of how robots could be trained and deployed into real-world applications. Google DeepMind is one of the leading frontier labs and in recent years has been advancing its robot AI foundation models like Gemini Robotics, built on the large-scale, multi-modal Gemini model. Its models are designed to allow robots of any shape and size to perceive, reason, use tools and interact with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We developed our Gemini Robotics models to bring AI into the physical world,” said Carolina Parada, Senior Director of Robotics at Google DeepMind. “We are excited to begin working with the Boston Dynamics team to explore what’s possible with their new Atlas robot as we develop new models to expand the impact of robotics, and to scale robots safely and efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two teams provided additional details about the partnership to reporters during Hyundai’s scheduled CES media presentation. Hyundai Motor Group is the majority shareholder of Boston Dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
