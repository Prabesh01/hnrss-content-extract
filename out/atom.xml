    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Screenshots from developers: 2002 vs. 2015&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2002 I asked a number of developers/Unix people for screenshots of their desktops. I recently republished them, and, seeing the interest this generated, I thought it’d be fun to ask the same people* again 13 years later. To my delight I managed to reach many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Sans Dennis Ritchie and itojun, who are no longer with us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;my desktop is pretty boring, since it consists of xterm windows to whatever unix system i am using at the moment. the machine itself is likely to be running some x-window server like exceed on some flavor of windows, though for many years i just used an x terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you thought it was boring last time, check this out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2002:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I don’t know how to make a screenshot, because I normally use my computer in text-mode. I have X and GNOME installed, but I use them only occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2015:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Under X, I use the standard environment of Trisquel, but mostly I type at Emacs in a console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Well, my desktop is quite boring. I mostly work with four xterms and a few Netscape windows. The KDE bar hides automatically, you can only see a thin grey line at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is the new one. You'll see that, like before, I have lots of xterms where I work on Vim, Zimbu and email. Now using the Chrome browser, showing off the Zimbu homepage. But clearly everything has become bigger!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Linux (2.4.20-pre5), Gnome2, vim, Pine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not that much has changed in 13 years. Still using Linux. Still just a browser window and a ton of terminals hiding behind them. The main change is that switched from Pine to Thunderbird for email at some point. The OS on my laptop here is Ubuntu with Unity although there are a lot of Debian packages installed so it is a bit of a hybrid at this point. Oh, and yes, my son Carl is a lot older now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ah, my desktop is pretty boring, I used fvwm 1.24 as my window manager and I try to have no more than 1 or 2 windows open per virtual desktop. I use FreeBSD 4-STABLE as my operating system. I first came across Unix when I got an account on a Pyramid 90x running OSx. This had a dual-universe setup: both AT&amp;amp;T and BSD-style environments, chosen by an environment variable. Initially I was given the AT&amp;amp;T environment, but my friends convinced me to ``come over” to BSD. Since then I’ve been a BSD afficionado.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After OSx, SunOS 3.5 and later SunOS releases, until 386BSD 0.1 came out and I started to run BSD at home. Then when 386BSD transmogrified to FreeBSD, I went with FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In terms of desktop, I’m a command-line guy, always will be. My favourite editor is vi, my favourite shell is tcsh (but kudos to rc for elegance). So I don’t really feel the need for GUI things like Gnome or KDE :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How things have (and have not changed). I'm still a command-line junkie with at least two xterm windows open. I'm still using a 3x3 virtual desktop. However, instead of fvwm, it is now LXDE. I've also switched from FreeBSD to Linux and I'm running Lubuntu as my distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else's server.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I'm so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You’ll probably be sad (or perhaps not) to hear that my desktop hasn’t really changed much at all - still OS X, though because OS X has virtual desktops now I have multiple “desktops” (6 of them) where Mail.app runs on one, Safari on another, Calendar, Slack, etc - all on separate desktops. This makes it a bit boring, but here’s the one I probably spend the most time in - the terminal window desktop. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There we go. Actually, that’s a condensate in one workspace cause I usually use about 4. Some of my favourite apps:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) are an indisputable breakthrough of the last five years, potentially profoundly changing the way that we work. As with any extraordinarily powerful tool, LLM use has both promise and peril — and that they are so general-purpose leaves real questions about how and when they should be used. The landscape is shifting so rapidly that static prescription is unlikely — but that LLMs are evolving so quickly also gives urgency to the question: how should LLMs be used at Oxide?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Values in LLM usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is our wont, it’s helpful to look at LLM use through the lens of our values, several of which come to mind, listed here in priority order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Responsibility: In terms of LLM use at Oxide, our lodestar is our sense of responsibility. However powerful they may be, LLMs are but a tool, ultimately acting at the behest of a human. Oxide employees bear responsibility for the artifacts we create, whatever automation we might employ to create them. That is, human judgement remains firmly in the loop: even if or as an LLM is generating an artifact that we will use (writing, test cases, documentation, code, etc.), their output is the responsibility of the human using them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rigor: LLMs are double-edged with respect to rigor. On the one hand, wielded carefully, they can help us sharpen our own thinking by pointing out holes in our own reasoning or otherwise providing thought-provoking suggestions. On the other, if used recklessly or thoughtlessly, they can have the opposite effect, replacing crisp thinking with generated flotsam. LLMs are useful in as much as they promote and reinforce our rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Empathy: Be we readers or writers, there are humans on the other end of our language use. As we use LLMs, we must keep in mind our empathy for that human, be they the one who is consuming our writing, or the one who has written what we are reading.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Teamwork: We are working together on a shared endeavor, and we must be sure that our LLM use does not undermine our sense of teamwork. Specifically, we must be careful to not use LLMs in such a way as to undermine the trust that we have in one another. This isn’t as simple as disclosure of usage: and in fact, volunteering that an LLM has been used to generate work product is to implicitly distance oneself from the responsibility for the content — and serves as to erode the trust that is essential for teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Urgency: Urgency seems natural with a tool that can seemingly do so much knowledge work so quickly, but with respect to LLM use, too many organizations have seemingly enshrined urgency over all else. These organizations treat LLMs as an opportunity to increase pace over all else, seemingly without regard for setting direction. Urgency is certainly important, and LLMs absolutely afford an opportunity to do work more quickly — but that pace must not come at the expense of our responsibility, rigor, empathy and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Uses of LLMs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM use varies widely, and the ramifications of those uses vary accordingly; it’s worth taking apart several of the (many) uses for LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLMs as readers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are superlative at reading comprehension, able to process and meaningfully comprehend documents effectively instantly. This can be extraordinarily powerful for summarizing documents — or of answering more specific questions of a large document like a datasheet or specification. (Ironically, LLMs are especially good at evaluating documents to assess the degree that an LLM assisted their creation!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While use of LLMs to assist comprehension has little downside, it does come with an important caveat: when uploading a document to a hosted LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), there must be assurance of data privacy — and specifically, assurance that the model will not use the document to train future iterations of itself. Note that this may be opt-out (that is, by default, a model may reserve the right to train on uploaded documents), but can generally be controlled via preferences — albeit occasionally via euphemism. (OpenAI shamelessly calls this checked-by-default setting "Improve the model for everyone", making anyone who doesn’t wish the model to train on their data feel as if they suffer from a kind of reactionary avarice.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A final cautionary note: using LLMs to assist comprehension should not substitute for actually reading a document where such reading is socially expected. More concretely: while LLMs can be a useful tool to assist in the evaluating of candidate materials per [rfd3], their use should be restricted to be as a tool, not as a substitute for human eyes (and brain!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLMs as editors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs can be excellent editors. Engaging an LLM late in the creative process (that is, with a document already written and broadly polished), allows for LLMs to provide helpful feedback on structure, phrasing, etc. — all without danger of losing one’s own voice. A cautionary note here: LLMs are infamous pleasers — and you may find that the breathless praise from an LLM is in fact more sycophancy than analysis. This becomes more perilous the earlier one uses an LLM in the writing process: the less polish a document already has, the more likely it is that an LLM will steer to something wholly different — at once praising your groundbreaking genius while offering to rewrite it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLMs as writers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While LLMs are adept at reading and can be terrific at editing, their writing is much more mixed. At best, writing from LLMs is hackneyed and clichÃ©-ridden; at worst, it brims with tells that reveal that the prose is in fact automatically generated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s so bad about this? First, to those who can recognize an LLM’s reveals (an expanding demographic!), it’s just embarrassing — it’s as if the writer is walking around with their intellectual fly open. But there are deeper problems: LLM-generated writing undermines the authenticity of not just one’s writing but of the thinking behind it as well. If the prose is automatically generated, might the ideas be too? The reader can’t be sure — and increasingly, the hallmarks of LLM generation cause readers to turn off (or worse).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, LLM-generated prose undermines a social contract of sorts: absent LLMs, it is presumed that of the reader and the writer, it is the writer that has undertaken the greater intellectual exertion. (That is, it is more work to write than to read!) For the reader, this is important: should they struggle with an idea, they can reasonably assume that the writer themselves understands it — and it is the least a reader can do to labor to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, however, prose is LLM-generated, this social contract becomes ripped up: a reader cannot assume that the writer understands their ideas because they might not so much have read the product of the LLM that they tasked to write it. If one is lucky, these are LLM hallucinations: obviously wrong and quickly discarded. If one is unlucky, however, it will be a kind of LLM-induced cognitive dissonance: a puzzle in which pieces don’t fit because there is in fact no puzzle at all. This can leave a reader frustrated: why should they spend more time reading prose than the writer spent writing it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can be navigated, of course, but it is truly perilous: our writing is an important vessel for building trust — and that trust can be quickly eroded if we are not speaking with our own voice. For us at Oxide, there is a more mechanical reason to be jaundiced about using LLMs to write: because our hiring process very much selects for writers, we know that everyone at Oxide can write — and we have the luxury of demanding of ourselves the kind of writing that we know that we are all capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So our guideline is to generally not use LLMs to write, but this shouldn’t be thought of as an absolute — and it doesn’t mean that an LLM can’t be used as part of the writing process. Just please: consider your responsibility to yourself, to your own ideas — and to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLMs as code reviewers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with reading comprehension and editing, LLMs can make for good code reviewers. But they can also make nonsense suggestions or otherwise miss larger issues. LLMs should be used for review (and can be very helpful when targeted to look for a particular kind of issue), but that review should not be accepted as a human substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLMs as debuggers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs can be surprisingly helpful debugging problems, but perhaps only because our expectations for them would be so low. While LLMs shouldn’t be relied upon (clearly?) to debug a problem, they can serve as a kind of animatronic rubber duck, helping to inspire the next questions to ask. (And they can be surprising: LLMs have been known to debug I2C issues from the screenshot of a scope capture!) When debugging a vexing problem one has little to lose by using an LLM — but perhaps also little to gain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLMs as programmers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are amazingly good at writing code — so much so that there is borderline mass hysteria about LLMs entirely eliminating software engineering as a craft. As with using an LLM to write prose, there is obvious peril here! Unlike prose, however (which really should be handed in a polished form to an LLM to maximize the LLM’s efficacy), LLMs can be quite effective writing code de novo. This is especially valuable for code that is experimental or auxiliary or otherwise throwaway. The closer code is to the system that we ship, the greater care needs to be shown when using LLMs. Even with something that seems natural for LLM contribution (e.g., writing tests), one should still be careful: it’s easy for LLMs to spiral into nonsense on even simple tasks. Still, they can be extraordinarily useful — and can help to provide an entire spectrum of utility in writing software; they shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever LLM-generated code is used, it becomes the responsibility of the engineer. As part of this process of taking responsibility, self-review becomes essential: LLM-generated code should not be reviewed by others if the responsible engineer has not themselves reviewed it. Moreover, once in the loop of peer review, generation should more or less be removed: if code review comments are addressed by wholesale re-generation, iterative review becomes impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, where LLMs are used to generate code, responsibility, rigor, empathy and teamwork must remain top of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mechanics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mechanical details of using LLMs — along with many specific tips and links — can be found in the (internal) LLMs at Oxide document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Determinations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, LLM use is encouraged at Oxide, but that use must always be consistent with our deeply-held sense of responsibility: our responsibility to our product, our responsibility to our customers — and our responsibility to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Eurydice: a Rust to C compiler (yes)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest surprise of the last two years was, for me, the realization that people not only care about compiling C to Rust (for obvious reasons, such as, ahem, memory safety) â they also care about compiling Rust to C! Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote about this briefly a couple years ago, but the level of interest for the project, I must say, took me somewhat by surprise. So letâs talk about compiling Rust to C a little more today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Barriers to Rust adoption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is making big progress in terms of adoption, and represents a great value proposition, especially for new code. Both my former employer and my new employer, like pretty much everyone else these days, have big projects that are written in pure Rust or can have Rust components. Even Windows kernel drivers can be written in Rust now. Amazing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if your project is, say, an open-source library that gets compiled on a wonderfully diverse set of target architectures, OSes, distributions and toolchains, well, chances areâ¦ one of these is not going to support Rust. Think of a crypto library: there will be people out there with an obscure compiler for a weird embedded target, and they really want to compile your library, because theyâve been told not to roll out their own crypto. Or perhaps you have a format library ridden with memory errors and you want to port it to Rust. Or maybe your company has an in-house analysis that only runs on C code. Regardless of the scenario, there will always be that one legacy use-case that prevents you from switching to Rust until itâs 2035, all those LTS versions (looking at you RHEL) are finally retired, and you yourself are too close to retirement to even care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, unless youâre willing to use a Rust to C compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a backwards-compat scenario where Rust can be compiled to C serves several purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It allows for a gradual transition. The codebase can be ported to Rust, and refactored / cleaned up / rewritten to use all the nice Rust things (data types, pattern-matching, polymorphism, memory safety), thus making you and your developers much, much happier. Meanwhile, the C version co-exists so that you donât alienate your userbase.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It only requires maintaining a single version. The Rust code is authoritative; the C code is derived from it automatically, either on CI, or at least with a CI job that checks that the two are in sync.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It allows for a census of problematic scenarios. By making the Rust version the default (and putting the fallback C behind a &lt;code&gt;--write-us-an-email&lt;/code&gt;flag), there is finally a way to enumerate those mythical users who cannot switch to Rust just yet.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that sounds appealing, meet Eurydice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eurydice is a compiler from Rust to C that aims to produce readable C code. Of course, readability is subjective; also, seeing that Rust relies on whole-program monomorphization, the C code is bound to be more verbose than the Rust code. But you can judge for yourself: hereâs the result of compiling libcrux to C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The output of the test suite is under version control, and there are a lot more tests to peruse. See for instance this bit, compared to the Rust original.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The design of Eurydice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eurydice plugs in directly at the MIR level, using Charon to avoid reimplementing the wheel and paying the price of interacting with the guts of &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt;. Our
paper on Charon says more about its
architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advantage of plugging in at the MIR level is that i) we do not have to interpret syntactic sugar, which means our translation is more faithful to the Rust semantics, and ii) we have way fewer constructs that need compiling to C. Even then, itâs no easy feat to translate Rust to C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is naturally, the need to perform whole-program monomorphization, over types and const-generic arguments; the compilation of pattern matches into tagged unions; recognizing instances of iterators that can be compiled to native C &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loops. Then, there are more subtle things, such as compiling array
repeat expressions sensibly â zero-initializers when possible, initializer
lists otherwise, unless it generates too much code, in which case &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;-loops are
preferable. And finally, there are all the rules about visibility, &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;, etc. that are very C-specific and depend on how you want to lay out
your C files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The translation is complicated by the constraint that the generated code ought to be readable: for instance, we compile Rust structs to C structs, including DSTs, by relying on flexible array members. We also work hard to avoid using the fully-generic tagged union pattern when possible, instead eliminating the tag when e.g. the Rust enum only has a single case. Additionally, we rely on Charon to reconstruct control-flow, rather than compile the MIR CFG to C code ridden with &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;s; again, this is for code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a low-level, there were many interesting tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because arrays in Rust are values, we wrap them within C structs to give them value semantics in C, too; concretely, &lt;code&gt;[u32; 8]&lt;/code&gt;becomes&lt;code&gt;struct { uint32_t data[8]; }&lt;/code&gt;. (A previous version of Eurydice would emit&lt;code&gt;uint32_t *&lt;/code&gt;, and rely on various&lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt;s to implement value semantics, but this produced a translation that was not type-generic, and there were plenty of finicky corner cases. We revamped the compilation scheme recently.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The notion of &lt;code&gt;lvalue&lt;/code&gt;in C means we need to insert more variable declarations than in Rust â for instance, you canât trivially compile&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;[0u32; 1]&lt;/code&gt;without naming the array.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The fact that the evaluation order is so loosely defined in C means that intermediary computations need to be stored in intermediary variables to enforce the evaluation order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust relies on whole-program monomorphization; this means that the C code is inevitably going to contains multiple copies of the same types and functions, but for different choices of type and const generic argumnets. This is currently done with a builtin phase in Eurydice (for historical reasons), but in the long run, we want to rely on Charonâs support for monomorphization.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are plenty of peephole optimizations that are required for good code quality, such as recognizing &lt;code&gt;array::from_fn&lt;/code&gt;and generating sensible code that initializes the array in-place (instead of relying on the fully-general compilation scheme for closures), or recognizing instances of the&lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;trait that deserve dedicated treatment (such as using&lt;code&gt;memcmp&lt;/code&gt;for arrays and slices of flat data).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A final design choice is that for now, Eurydice may define more behaviors than Rust â for instance, Rust panics on integer overflow, but Eurydice-compiled code does not. This is because we assume the input code is verified, and therefore has been shown to be free of panics. This design choice can be easily changed, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, as soon as you use traits, the C code becomes more voluminous than the Rust code. We rely on a configuration file mechanism to control the placement of monomorphized instances of a given function, rather than put everything in one big C file. This currently requires a lot of manual intervention to give good results on large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Implementing of Eurydice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eurydice starts by compiling the MIR AST obtained out of Charon into KaRaMeLâs internal AST. This is ~3000 lines of OCaml code, so thatâs already pretty involved. A lot of the work revolves around trait methods and their monomorphization, given Rustâs expressive trait system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, about 30 nanopasses simplify the KaRaMeL AST until it becomes eligible for compilation to C. Of those, a handful were originally written for KaRaMeL and were somewhat reusable; this includes compilation of data types, as well as monomorphization. The rest was written from scratch for Eurydice, and totals about ~5000 lines of OCaml code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A particularly gnarly phase was eliminating MIRâs variable assignments as much as possible: in MIR, every variable starts out uninitialized at the beginning of the function; then, in lieu of the variable declaration, we have an assignment with the initial value. Naturally, having a variable declaration in the right spot is better for code quality, so an initial phase tries to reconstruct these assignments. Thatâs a drawback of using MIR, but we still firmly believe that sticking to something that has clear semantics is ultimately better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: because there are so many peephole optimizations, I got tired of maintaining enormous pattern-matches that would try to catch every flavor of Rust iterator that can be compiled to a C for-loop. Instead, a custom OCaml syntax extension allows writing concrete syntax for the internal KaRaMeL language in OCaml patterns. Those magic patterns then get compiled at compile-time to OCaml AST nodes for an actual OCaml pattern that matches the (deeply-embedded) syntax of KaRaMeLâs AST. This relies on a &lt;code&gt;ppx&lt;/code&gt;
that lexes, parses and compiles the concrete syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Deploying Eurydice-generated code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eurydice-generated code expects some hand-written glue that contains macros and &lt;code&gt;static inline&lt;/code&gt; functions; sometimes, itâs simply more convenient to write a
single macro that uses a type, rather than have Eurydice generate N copies of a
polymorphic function that gets specialized each time. A typical example is
compiling the Eq trait for arrays: itâs nicer to emit &lt;code&gt;Eurydice_array_eq(a1, a2,
len, t)&lt;/code&gt;, which macro-expands to &lt;code&gt;!(memcmp(a1, a2, len*sizeof(t)))&lt;/code&gt;, rather than
have N such functions, each containing a for-loop specialized for different
values of &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eurydice generates code that is either (C11 and C++20-compatible) or (C++-17 compatible, but not C-compatible). The reason for this is that Rust allows enum values (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Foo { bar: baz }&lt;/code&gt;) in any expression position. For simplicity,
Eurydice emits a compound initializer &lt;code&gt;(Foo) { .tag = bar, .value = { .case_Foo
= { .bar = baz }}}&lt;/code&gt;, or a C++20 aggregate that uses designated initializers,
relying on a macro (not shown here) to hide the syntax differences between the
two. But C++17 does not have designated initializers, so there is an option for
Eurydice to emit different code that relies on member pointers to achieve
sensibly the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Limitations of Eurydice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, there are many limitations to this approach. Here are the main ones that come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;we cannot guarantee that the layout of objects will be the same in C as in Rust; conceivably, one could parse the layout information from MIR, then emit compiler-specific alignment directives to keep the two identical, but this is not done currently;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the generated code violates strict aliasing, because creating a user-defined DST involves casting one pointer type (a struct containing an array) to another (a struct with a flexible array member instead); Iâm not sure what the best fix is, so for now, please compile your code with &lt;code&gt;-fno-strict-aliasing&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the code that Eurydice sees is MIR after applying &lt;code&gt;cfg&lt;/code&gt;tweaks; this means that for code that is intended to be multi-platform, some tricks need to be applied, otherwise, Eurydice will only âseeâ one version of the code (AVX2, or ARM64, or something else)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;because monorphization is so pervasive, the configuration language needs to express things such as âtypes that reference &lt;code&gt;__m256i&lt;/code&gt;, an AVX2-only type, need to go into a separate file to be compiled with&lt;code&gt;-mavx2&lt;/code&gt;â; this can get tedious real fast but Iâm not sure I know how to do better.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Whatâs next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is ongoing work to integrate Eurydice-generated code for both Microsoft and Googleâs respective crypto libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The community grew recently, with wonderful contributions by GitHub users @ssyram and @lin23299. There are more in the pipeline, and I look forward to seeing the supported subset of Rust grow even more. Next on the horizon is support for &lt;code&gt;dyn&lt;/code&gt; traits via vtables, and relying on Charonâs monomorphization
to get MIR exactly as the Rust compiler would monomorphize it, intead of relying
on a custom procedure in Eurydice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An ambitious goal is for the whole standard library of Rust to be extractable via Eurydice in 2026. This is non-trivial, but I believe this achievement is within reach. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;PS: Why the name?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People keep asking about the name; because the project shares a large amount of infrastructure with Aeneas and Charon, I had to follow the Greek mythology theme. Specifically, the myth of Eurydice resonated with me: I thought I was saved from the hell of generating C code, and was going to go back to the world of the living, but alas, no.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Homemade 1000+ transistor array chip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018 I made the first lithographically fabricated integrated circuits in my garage fab. I was a senior in high school when I made the Z1 amplifier, and now I’m a senior in college so there are some long overdue improvements to the amateur silicon process.&lt;lb/&gt; The Z1 had 6 transistors and was a great test chip to develop all the processes and equipment. The Z2 has 100 transistors on a 10µm polysilicon gate process – same technology as Intel’s first processor. My chip is a simple 10×10 array of transistors to test, characterize, and tweak the process but this is a huge step closer to more advanced DIY computer chips. The Intel 4004 has 2,200 transistors and I’ve now made 1,200 on the same piece of silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, I made chips with a metal gate process. The aluminum gate has a large work function difference with the silicon channel beneath it which results in a high threshold voltage (&amp;gt;10V). I used these metal gate transistors in a few fun projects like a guitar distortion pedal and a ring oscillator LED blinker but both of these required one or two 9V batteries to run the circuit due to high Vth. By switching to a polysilicon gate process, I get a ton of performance benefits (self aligned gate means lower overlap capacitances) including a much lower Vth which makes these chips compatible with 2.5V and 3.3V logic levels. The new FETs have excellent characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;NMOS Electrical Properties: Vth = 1.1 V Vgs MAX = 8 V Cgs = &amp;lt;0.9 pF Rise/fall time = &amp;lt;10 ns On/off ratio = 4.3e6 Leakage current = 932 pA (Vds=2.5V)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was particularly surprised by the super low leakage current. This value goes up about 100x in ambient room lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we know that it’s possible to make really good transistors with impure chemicals, no cleanroom, and homemade equipment. Of course, yield and process repeatability are diminished. I’ll do more testing to collect data on the statistics and variability of FET properties but it’s looking good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip is small, about one quarter the die area of my previous ICs (2.4mm^2) which makes it hard to probe. There’s a simple 10×10 array of N-channel FETs on each chip which will give me a lot of characterization data. Since it’s such a simple design, I was able to lay it out using Photoshop. Columns of 10 transistors share a common gate connection and each row is strung together in series with adjacent transistors sharing a source/drain terminal. It’s similar to NAND flash but I only did this to keep the metal pads large enough so I can reasonably probe them, if every FET had 3 pads for itself they would be too small.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to convey the excitement of seeing a good FET curve displayed on the curve tracer after dipping a shard of rock into chemicals all day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single 10µm NMOS transistor can be see below, with slight misalignment in the metal layer (part of the left contact is uncovered). Red outline is polycrystalline silicon, blue is the source/drain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I’ve made an opamp (Z1) and a memory-like array (Z2). More interesting circuits are definitely possible even with this low transistor density. The process needs some tweaking but now that I’m able to consistently make good quality transistors I should be able to design more complex digital and analog circuits. Testing each chip is very tedious so I am trying to automate the process and I’ll post more data then. I’ve made 15 chips (1,500 transistors) and know there’s at least one completely functional chip and at least two “mostly functional”, meaning ~80% of the transistors work instead of 100%. No proper yield data yet. The most common defect is a drain or source shorted to the bulk silicon channel, not a leaky or shorted gate like on my Z1 process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said before that the gate used to be made out of aluminum and now it’s silicon which makes the chips work a lot better. Silicon comes in three varieties that we care about: amorphous, polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. From left to right, these become more electrically conductive but also much harder to deposit. In fact, monocrystalline Si can’t be deposited, you can only grow it in contact with another mono-Si layer as a seed (epitaxy). Since the gate must be deposited on top of an insulating dielectric, poly is the best we can do. We can heavily dope the polysilicon anyway to make it more conductive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical self-aligned polysilicon gate process requires silane, a toxic and explosive gas, to deposit polycrystalline silicon layers. It may also be possible by sputtering or evaporating amorphous silicon and annealing with a laser. A major theme of this DIY silicon process is to circumvent expensive, difficult, or dangerous steps. So, I came up with a modified process flow. It’s a variation on the standard self-aligned methods to allow doping via high temperature diffusion rather than ion implantation. The effect is that I’m able to buy a silicon wafer with the polysilicon already deposited on it from the factory and pattern it to make transistors instead of putting my own polysilicon down halfway through the process. This is a nice short term workaround but it would be best to design a polysilicon deposition process using the laser anneal method mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wafers are available with all kinds of materials deposited on them already, so I just had to find one with a thin layer of SiO2 (gate oxide, ~10nm) followed by a thicker polysilicon (300nm). I found a lot of 25 200mm (EPI, prime, [1-0-0], p-type) wafers on eBay for $45 which is essentially a lifetime supply, so email me if you want one. The gate oxide is the most fragile layer and requires the most care during fabrication. Since I bought the wafer with a nice high quality oxide on it already that was capped off and kept clean by the thick polysilicon layer, I was able to eliminate all the aggressive cleaning chemicals (sulfuric acid, etc) from the process and still make great transistors. Minimal process chemicals and tools are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Chemicals used in home poly-gate process: -Water -Alcohol -Acetone -Phosphoric acid -Photoresist -Developer (2% KOH) -N type dopant (filmtronics P509) -HF (1%) or CF4/CHF3 RIE -HNO3 for poly etch or SF6 RIE&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Equipment used in home poly-gate process: -Hotplate -Tube furnace -Lithography apparatus -Microscope -Vacuum chamber to deposit metal&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Z2 “gate first” process (similar to standard self-aligned process but without a field oxide):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I snapped one of the test chips in half (functional Z2 but with bad layer alignment and thin metal, about 300nm) and put it in my SEM for a cross section:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the dust particle in the red circle below, use that to get oriented in the coming cross section views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I bought the wafer already with gate oxide and polysilicon on it, I can’t grow a field oxide. These thick oxide layers are typically used to mask dopants and require a long high temperature step which would oxidize all of my poly and there would be none remaining. So, my modified process uses an additional masking step (the “gate” mask is typically not found in a self-aligned process) that allows me to use the polysilicon itself as a dopant mask and hard-baked photoresist as the field dielectric. This alternative processing results in the stepped structure you can see in the orange region on the NMOS cross section above. This process subtlety is mentioned here, read this twitter thread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This process isn’t ideal and I want to make some changes so it’s CMOS compatible but it simplifies fabrication and makes it possible with a minimal set of tools. The 1µm dielectric layer (orange) would ideally be CVD SiO2 (it’s possible to build a TEOS oxide reactor at home) but I used a photoresist instead. Most photoresists can be baked around 250°C to form a hard permanent dielectric layer that is an easy alternative to CVD or PECVD oxide. A spin-on-glass/sol-gel could also be used here. SiO2 etching is done with a buffered HF solution made from rust stain remover or RIE.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Discovering the indieweb with calm tech&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When social media first entered my life, it came with a promise of connection. Facebook connected college-aged adults in a way that was previously impossible, helping to shape our digital generation. Social media was our super-power and we wielded it to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet social media today is a noisy, needy, mental health hazard. They push distracting notifications, constantly begging us to “like and subscribe”, and trying to trap us in endless scrolling. They have become sirens that lure us into their ad-infested shores with their saccharine promise of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can we defeat these monsters that have invaded deep into our world, while still staying connected?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;StreetPass for Mastodon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I stumbled into a great browser extension, StreetPass for Mastodon. The creator, tvler, built it to help people find each other on Mastodon. StreetPass autodiscovers Mastodon verification links as you browse the web, building a collection of Mastodon accounts from the blogs and personal websites you’ve encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StreetPass is a beautiful example of calm technology . When StreetPass finds Mastodon profiles it doesn’t draw your attention with a notification, it quietly adds the profile to a list, knowing you’ll check in when you’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StreetPass recognizes that there’s no need for an immediate call to action. Instead it allows the user to focus on their browsing, enriching their experience in the background. The user engages with StreetPass when they are ready, and on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StreetPass is open source and available for Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inspired by StreetPass, I applied this technique to RSS feed discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Blog Quest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blog Quest is a web browser extension that helps you discover and subscribe to blogs. Blog Quest checks each page for auto-discoverable RSS and Atom feeds (using &lt;code&gt;rel="alternate"&lt;/code&gt; links) and quietly collects them in the background.
When you’re ready to explore the collected feeds, open the extension’s drop-down window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extension integrates with several feed readers, making subscription management nearly effortless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blog Quest is available for both Firefox and Chrome. The project is open source and I encourage you to build your own variants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ubiquitous yet hidden&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I reject the dead Internet theory: I see a vibrant Internet full of humans sharing their experiences and seeking connection. Degradation of the engagement-driven web is well underway, accelerated by AI slop. But the independent web works on a different incentive structure and is resistant to this effect. Humans inherently create, connect, and share: we always have and we always will. If you choose software that works in your interest you’ll find that it’s possible to make meaningful online connections without mental hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out StreetPass and Blog Quest to discover a decentralized, independent Internet that puts you in control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't drown out the noise of social media by shouting louder, you've got to whisper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After exploring Java bytecode in previous years (2022, 2023, 2024), this year we’ll take an unexpected detour for a Java advent: instead of generating Java bytecode, we’ll use Java to build and execute LLVM IR, the intermediate language behind compilers like clang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Java’s Foreign Function &amp;amp; Memory (FFM) API, we’ll call the LLVM C API, generate a “Hello, World!” program, and even JIT-compile it to native code – all from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task is simple: create a program that simply prints “Hello, World!”. But we must do this from Java via LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is LLVM?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LLVM Project, a collection of modular compiler and toolchain technologies, began as a research project over 20 years ago at the University of Illinois. It has grown significantly, underpinning many compilers and tools like clang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core libraries provide a source &amp;amp; target independent optimizer along with code generation for a multitude of target machines. They are built around the LLVM IR, an intermediate representation, which we’ll generate &amp;amp; execute from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing LLVM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use the LLVM C API from Java, we’ll need LLVM’s shared libraries and headers installed locally. There is an automatic installation script available to easily install LLVM on Ubuntu/Debian systems, for example to install LLVM 20:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ ./llvm.sh 20
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have LLVM installed we can use the LLVM tooling to execute textual-form LLVM IR and we’ll also be able to use the LLVM C API in Java via the FFM API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LLVM IR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM IR is a strongly-typed, SSA-based intermediate language. It abstracts away most machine-specific details, making it easier to represent high-level constructs in a compiler-friendly format. There are three equivalent representations of the IR: an in-memory format, a bitcode format for serialisation and a human readable assembly language representation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The textual form of the LLVM IR for our “Hello, World!” looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
@str = private constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

declare i32 @puts(ptr)

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, we’ll generate this via Java but, for now, if you save this in a file called helloworld.ll you can try executing it with the LLVM interpreter, lli:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ lli helloworld.ll
Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few types of entities used in the helloworld.ll example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A global variable containing the string “Hello World!”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A declaration of the external libc puts function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A definition of the main function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instructions to call puts and return an integer exit code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can dive deeper into the LLVM “Hello, World!” example here if you like before continuing to the next section, where we’ll start using the Java FFM API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is the Java FFM API?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API enables Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime. The API is a replacement for the older JNI API that enables Java programs to call native libraries in a safer way. The API can be used to call foreign functions and safely access foreign memory that is not managed by the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A companion to the FFM API is a tool named jextract that can automatically generate Java bindings from a C header file. &lt;code&gt;jextract&lt;/code&gt; parses C header files and automatically generates the Java source code with method handles and type-safe FFM bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use the &lt;code&gt;jextract&lt;/code&gt; tool to generate bindings for the LLVM C API and those bindings will allow us to call the LLVM API from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s create a simple project to start. We’ll use maven to build our project but you can use another build tool if you like, it’s not important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=jvm-llvm-helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have a project skeleton, update the pom.xml file to set the Java version &amp;gt;= 22:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;maven.compiler.source&amp;gt;25&amp;lt;/maven.compiler.source&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;maven.compiler.target&amp;gt;25&amp;lt;/maven.compiler.target&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then build and run the program to check everything is OK:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ mvn clean install
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
Hello World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maven generated sample already printed “Hello, World!” but that’s too easy! We’ll remove that and generate it via LLVM in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s now create the LLVM bindings using &lt;code&gt;jextract&lt;/code&gt; so that we can use the LLVM API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creating LLVM bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use jextract to generate bindings from the LLVM C API header files. Make sure LLVM is available on your system (see Installing LLVM above) and you’ll also need to download jextract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following jextract command (on Linux) will create Java bindings for the specified LLVM C headers, placing the generated code into the &lt;code&gt;com.example.llvm&lt;/code&gt; package within the &lt;code&gt;src/main/java&lt;/code&gt; directory, with the main header class named &lt;code&gt;LLVM&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ jextract -l LLVM-20 -I /usr/include/llvm-c-20 \
     -I /usr/include/llvm-20 \
     -t com.example.llvm \
     --output src/main/java \
     --header-class-name LLVM \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Core.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Support.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/ExecutionEngine.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Target.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/TargetMachine.h
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test the generated bindings, let’s print the LLVM version using the static method generated for LLVM version string constant: edit the sample’s App.java file to print the version using the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run this, you’ll see the LLVM version printed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED com.example.App
LLVM version: 20.0.0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the use of &lt;code&gt;--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED&lt;/code&gt; to prevent warnings about native code access; I’ll omit this for brevity in later commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Segments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;LLVM_VERSION_STRING&lt;/code&gt; method returns a MemorySegment rather than a Java String. In the FFM API, a &lt;code&gt;MemorySegment&lt;/code&gt; represents a contiguous region of memory—either on or off the Java heap—enabling safe, structured access to native memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the implementation in the generated source file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
   public static MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING() {
    class Holder {
      static final MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING
         = LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA.allocateFrom("20.0.0");
    }
    return Holder.LLVM_VERSION_STRING;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method allocates memory containing the version string that contains the version number. The allocated MemorySegment is returned from the method and to get the String back into Java-land we need to call &lt;code&gt;getString(0)&lt;/code&gt; on the memory segment which reads a null-terminated string at the given offset (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;), using the UTF-8 charset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory segments are managed through arenas (such as the &lt;code&gt;LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA&lt;/code&gt; in the code above), which bridge Java’s managed heap and foreign memory spaces by applying familiar resource management patterns like try-with-resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we’ll need to allocate native memory, let’s declare an Arena:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
       // TODO
    }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creating an LLVM module&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we need to recreate the following LLVM IR via the LLVM C API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
declare i32 @puts(ptr)

@str = constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start by creating an LLVM module – the container for all functions and globals – and print it so that we can run it through the LLVM interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // TODO: Fill in the module
            
  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we execute this now, we’ll see an empty IR module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you pass this output through the LLVM interpreter, you’ll see that it tries to execute the module but cannot find the entry point main function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have an LLVM module, but it has no executable code – the interpreter rightly complains that main is missing; so let’s add the main function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding a main function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entry point to our program is the function named main which takes no parameters and returns an integer exit code, where a non-negative integer denotes success. We can add a function to the module using the LLVMAddFunction function, along with the LLVMFunctionType and LLVMInt32Type functions to create the function type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that all of these functions return a &lt;code&gt;MemorySegment&lt;/code&gt; and all 3 &lt;code&gt;LLVMAddFunction&lt;/code&gt; parameters are &lt;code&gt;MemorySegment&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

    // TODO: Add the code

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you execute this now you’ll see a declaration of the main function but it has no body so the LLVM interpreter will produce the same error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

declare i32 @main()

$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App|lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next we’ll add some instructions to the body of the function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding an entry basic block&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to add code to a function we need to add at least 1 basic block – the entry block. A basic block is a sequence of instructions within a function that executes straight through from start to finish, with no branches in the middle. These blocks form the nodes of the Control-Flow Graph (CFG), and they connect to each other based on how control flows between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic blocks can be added to a function with the LLVMAppendBasicBlock function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 
	  // TODO: Add the instructions

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run the program through &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; now, you’ll see a different error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
lli: &amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;:6:1: error: expected instruction opcode
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That makes sense, we don’t yet have any instructions in our function!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building instructions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To add instructions, we first create an instruction builder using the LLVMCreateBuilder function. This gives us an LLVMBuilder that we can use to insert new instructions into a basic block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll also use the LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd function to position the builder at the end of the entry block and LLVMBuildRet to build a return instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run the program and pass the output through &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; now, you’ll see nothing happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great news – the errors are gone! Checking the return code confirms the program exited successfully, returning 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ echo $?
0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try changing the 0 to some other number to confirm that the value is indeed coming from the exit code returned by the LLVM IR program!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Global variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A global variable, defined at the top-level in LLVM IR, defines a region of memory with a fixed address that is allocated when the program is loaded, rather than dynamically at runtime. Globals can be declared as constant if their values will never change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll add the string “Hello, World!” to our LLVM program as a global constant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t use the &lt;code&gt;hello_str&lt;/code&gt; yet so running &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; would produce the same as before, but you can see the string is now declared in the LLVM IR (prefixed with @ because it is a global, like the main function):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

@hello_str = private unnamed_addr constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00", align 1

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  ret i32 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s add the final instruction next – a call to &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; to print the string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calling functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we can call the libc puts function we must declare it in the module by first building the function type and then calling &lt;code&gt;LLVMAddFunction&lt;/code&gt; to add it to the module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve declared the function we can call it with the &lt;code&gt;@hello_str&lt;/code&gt; global as a parameter using the LLVMBuildCall2 function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running the program’s output through &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; will finally display the expected result: “Hello, World!”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you’ve successfully used the Java FFM API to call the LLVM C API to build an LLVM module that contains code to print “Hello, World!”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Just-in-time (JIT) Compilation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been printing LLVM IR and letting &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; execute it. But LLVM also exposes a JIT compiler API, allowing us to generate and execute machine code in-memory. Let’s see how to JIT our “Hello, World!” directly from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM IR is target independent but once we start compiling to native code we must know which machine we are targeting. We’ll target x86 Linux in the following code; if you’re using ARM, Mac or Windows you’ll need to adjust the code for your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to initialise and create an LLVM JIT compiler for the target machine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule&lt;/code&gt; sets up a JIT execution engine to compile an LLVM module to native machine code. &lt;code&gt;LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule&lt;/code&gt; will return a 1 upon failure and then we can check the error message string for more information but to simplify things we’ll ignore error handling for now. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requesting the address of the main function triggers its compilation – LLVM generates the machine code only when it’s first needed, hence the name Just-In-Time compilation. We can retrieve a pointer to the compiled function using &lt;code&gt;LLVMGetPointerToGlobal&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve compiled the function, we need a way to invoke it from Java. To do this, we use the foreign linker to create a &lt;code&gt;MethodHandle&lt;/code&gt; for the JIT-compiled main function. This handle acts as a callable reference to the native code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;downcallHandle&lt;/code&gt; method tells Java how to interpret the native function’s signature – in this case, a function that takes no arguments and returns an int.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can invoke the compiled native function directly from Java, just like a regular method call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));

 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);

    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target

    LLVMInitializeX86Target();

    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();

    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Execute the main function via the method handle.
    try {
      int result = (int) functionHandle.invoke();
      System.out.println("main() returned: " + result);
    } catch (Throwable e) {
      System.err.println("Error calling JIT function: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;functionHandle.invoke()&lt;/code&gt; runs, Java crosses into the native world and calls the machine code that was just compiled by the LLVM JIT compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s it, you can now run the Java application without the LLVM interpreter and see the resulting “Hello, World!”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you’ve now JIT-compiled Hello World, with the help of Java’s FFM API calling LLVM’s C API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this Java advent we built and executed native machine code from pure Java and a little help from LLVM – no JNI, no C glue, just memory segments, method handles, and a modern FFI. By the end, we had just a simple program that prints “Hello, World!” but it shows the potential of the Java FFM API and the things you can do when Java and native code work together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now see what else you can do, for example, try generating other instructions: print more text, do simple calculations, or even build tiny programs entirely in LLVM from Java.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Titans + MIRAS: Helping AI have long-term memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ali Behrouz, Student Researcher, Meisam Razaviyayn, Staff Researcher, and Vahab Mirrokni, VP and Google Fellow, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We introduce the Titans architecture and the MIRAS framework, which allow AI models to work much faster and handle massive contexts by updating their core memory while it's actively running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transformer architecture revolutionized sequence modeling with its introduction of attention, a mechanism by which models look back at earlier inputs to prioritize relevant input data. However, computational cost increases drastically with sequence length, which limits the ability to scale Transformer-based models to extremely long contexts, such as those required for full-document understanding or genomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research community explored various approaches for solutions, such as efficient linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and state space models (SSMs) like Mamba-2. These models offer fast, linear scaling by compressing context into a fixed-size. However, this fixed-size compression cannot adequately capture the rich information in very long sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In two new papers, Titans and MIRAS, we introduce an architecture and theoretical blueprint that combine the speed of RNNs with the accuracy of transformers. Titans is the specific architecture (the tool), and MIRAS is the theoretical framework (the blueprint) for generalizing these approaches. Together, they advance the concept of test-time memorization, the ability of an AI model to maintain long-term memory by incorporating more powerful “surprise” metrics (i.e., unexpected pieces of information) while the model is running and without dedicated offline retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MIRAS framework, as demonstrated by Titans, introduces a meaningful shift toward real-time adaptation. Instead of compressing information into a static state, this architecture actively learns and updates its own parameters as data streams in. This crucial mechanism enables the model to incorporate new, specific details into its core knowledge instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Titans: Learning new context on the fly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An effective learning system requires distinct yet interconnected memory modules, mirroring the human brain's separation of short-term and long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While attention mechanisms excel for precise, short-term memory, Titans introduces a novel neural long-term memory module, that, unlike the fixed-size vector or matrix memory in traditional RNNs, acts as a deep neural network (specifically, a multi-layer perceptron). This memory module provides significantly higher expressive power, allowing the model to summarize large volumes of information without losing important context. The model isn't simply taking notes; it's understanding and synthesizing the entire story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, Titans doesn’t just passively store data. It actively learns how to recognize and retain important relationships and conceptual themes that connect tokens across the entire input. A key aspect of this ability is what we call the “surprise metric”. In human psychology, we know we quickly and easily forget routine, expected events but remember things that break the pattern — unexpected, surprising, or highly emotional events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of Titans, the "surprise metric" is the model detecting a large difference between what it currently remembers and what the new input is telling it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low surprise: If the new word is "cat" and the model's memory state already expects an animal word, the gradient (surprise) is low. It can safely skip memorizing the word "cat" in its permanent long-term state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High surprise: If the model's memory state is summarizing a serious financial report, and the new input is a picture of a banana peel (the unexpected event), the gradient (surprise) will be very high. This signals that the new input is important or anomalous, and it must be prioritized for permanent storage in the long-term memory module.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model uses this internal error signal (the gradient) as a mathematical equivalent of saying, "This is unexpected and important!" This allows the Titans architecture to selectively update its long-term memory only with the most novel and context-breaking information, keeping the overall process fast and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Titans refines this mechanism by incorporating two critical elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Momentum: The model considers both "momentary surprise" (the current input) and "past surprise" (the recent context flow). This ensures relevant subsequent information is also captured, even if those tokens are not individually surprising.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forgetting (weight decay): To manage the finite capacity of the memory when dealing with extremely long sequences, Titans employ an adaptive weight decay mechanism. This acts as a forgetting gate, allowing the model to discard information that is no longer needed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MIRAS: A unified view of sequence modeling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every major breakthrough in sequence modeling — from modern transformers to the new, lightning-fast linear RNNs — is essentially the same thing under the hood: a highly complex associative memory module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, what makes MIRAS both unique and practical is the way it views AI modeling. Instead of seeing diverse architectures, it sees different methods of solving the same problem: efficiently combining new information with old memories without letting the essential concepts be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIRAS defines a sequence model through four key design choices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory architecture: The structure that stores information (e.g., a vector, matrix, or a deep multi-layer perceptron, like in Titans).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attentional bias: The internal learning objective the model optimizes that determines what it prioritizes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retention gate: The memory regularizer. MIRAS reinterprets "forgetting mechanisms" as specific forms of regularization that balance new learning against retaining past knowledge.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory algorithm: The optimization algorithm used to update the memory.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Transcending the mean squared error paradigm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virtually all successful existing sequence models rely on mean squared error (MSE) or dot-product similarity for both their bias and retention. This reliance can make models sensitive to outliers and limit their expressive power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIRAS transcends this limitation by providing a generative framework to explore a more rich design space informed by the literature in optimization and statistics. This allows for the creation of novel architectures with non-Euclidean objectives and regularization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using MIRAS, we created three specific attention-free models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;YAAD: We designed this MIRAS variant to be less sensitive to major errors or "outliers" (like a single typo in a large document). It uses a gentler math penalty (Huber loss) for mistakes, so it doesn't overreact to one-off issues. This makes the model more robust when the input data is messy or inconsistent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MONETA: This model explores the use of more complex and strict mathematical penalties (called generalized norms). It investigates whether using these more disciplined rules for both what the model attends to and what it forgets can lead to a more powerful and stable long-term memory system overall.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MEMORA: This model focuses on achieving the best possible memory stability by forcing its memory to act like a strict probability map. By using this constraint, it ensures that every time the memory state is updated, the changes are controlled and balanced. This guarantees a clean, stable process for integrating new information.Virtually all successful existing sequence models rely on mean squared error (MSE) or dot-product similarity for both their bias and retention. This reliance can make models sensitive to outliers and limit their expressive power.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experiments and results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We rigorously compared Titans along with MIRAS variants (YAAD, MONETA, MEMORA) against leading architectures, including Transformer++, Mamba-2, and Gated DeltaNet. We further validated versatility by testing Titans on genomic modeling (DNA) and time-series forecasting, proving the architecture generalizes effectively beyond text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across both standard language modeling datasets (C4, WikiText) and zero-shot reasoning tasks (HellaSwag, PIQA), our models consistently demonstrated higher accuracy and perplexity (a measure of how surprised an LLM is when looking at a piece of text).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The power of deep memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ablation studies clearly show that the depth of the memory architecture is crucial. When comparing long-term memory modules of the same size but different depths, modules with deeper memories consistently achieve lower perplexity in language modeling. Furthermore, they exhibit better scaling properties, maintaining performance as the sequence length increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Language modeling and efficiency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In language modeling and commonsense reasoning tasks, Titans architectures outperform state-of-the-art linear recurrent models (such as Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet) and Transformer++ baselines of comparable sizes. The novel MIRAS variants (MONETA, YAAD, MEMORA) also achieve improved performance compared to these baselines, validating the benefit of exploring robust, non-MSE optimization mechanisms. Importantly, these models maintain efficient, parallelizable training and fast linear inference speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extreme long-context recall&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant advantage of these new architectures is their ability to handle extremely long contexts. This is highlighted in the BABILong benchmark, a task requiring reasoning across facts distributed in extremely long documents. In this challenging setting, Titans outperforms all baselines, including extremely large models like GPT-4, despite having many fewer parameters. Titans further demonstrates the capability to scale effectively to context window sizes larger than 2 million tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The introduction of Titans and the MIRAS framework marks a significant advancement in sequence modeling. By employing deep neural networks as memory modules that learn to memorize as data is coming in, these approaches overcome the limitations of fixed-size recurrent states. Furthermore, MIRAS provides a powerful theoretical unification, revealing the connection between online optimization, associative memory, and architectural design. By moving beyond the standard Euclidean paradigm, this research opens the door to a new generation of sequence models that combine the efficiency of RNNs with the expressive power needed for the era of long-context AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How the Disappearance of Flight 19, a Navy Squadron Lost in 1945, Fueled the Legend of the Bermuda Triangle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Eighty years ago, five planes vanished during a training run off the Florida coast. A patrol plane sent to search for the men went missing, too, giving rise to a host of conspiracy theories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know where we are,” a voice on the radio said. “We must have got lost after that last turn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was the first inkling that something was amiss with Flight 19, a routine United States Navy training run off the coast of Florida on December 5, 1945. In the confusing hours that followed, the five torpedo bombers’ radio transmissions grew fainter as their fuel supply dwindled. Soon, the men—a mix of Marines and naval aviators—were no longer able to communicate with land, and two naval patrol bombers were dispatched to search for them. A short time later, one of the rescue planes abruptly dropped off radio contact and disappeared, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, six aircraft carrying 27 men (14 from Flight 19 and 13 from the patrol bomber) vanished over the so-called Bermuda Triangle that day. No confirmed trace of them has ever been found. Eighty years later, Flight 19 remains one of aviation’s most notable mysteries—and where answers are elusive, legions of theories have emerged to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From alien abductions to the lost continent of Atlantis, magnetic anomalies, methane eruptions and time travel, highly improbable explanations for the disappearances of planes and ships lost in the Bermuda Triangle have gripped the public’s imagination. Flight 19 has even appeared in both a Steven Spielberg film and a Scooby-Doo mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet the real postwar tragedy that inspired these fictionalizations is a mystery that denies the imagination a satisfying explanation, supernatural or otherwise. Instead, false assumptions, fleeting communications and a hastily scrambled rescue search left behind clues as to what transpired in the final moments of Flight 19—and exposed a series of decisions that, if they’d unfolded differently, might have brought the men home safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A minute-by-minute breakdown of the disappearance of Flight 19&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 2:10 p.m. on December 5, flight leader Charles Carroll Taylor, a 28-year-old lieutenant known as “C.C.,” took off from Naval Air Station (NAS) Fort Lauderdale. He was accompanied by four other planes. The squadron’s flight plan advised the men to practice bombing on a small grouping of rocks near the Bahamian island of Bimini, a distance of 56 miles, then fly up over the northern islands of the Bahamas before turning back east to Fort Lauderdale—a routine navigation exercise intended to last around 2 hours and 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Robert F. Cox, the pilot of an unrelated flight coming out of the same air station, picked up that first concerning transmission shortly before 3:45 p.m., according to declassified records digitized by the National Archives. In a later interview with investigators, Cox recounted establishing contact with Taylor, who informed him that “both my compasses are out. … I am over land, but it’s broken. I’m sure I’m in the [Florida] Keys, but I don’t know how far down, and I don’t know how to get to Fort Lauderdale.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cox, who didn’t yet realize that Flight 19 couldn’t have made it as far south as the Keys, advised Taylor to fly north, with the setting sun visible to the west on his left wing. He also offered to fly toward the lost pilot’s location to pick the men up. Taylor waved Cox off, reassuring his fellow lieutenant that he now knew where he was. “Don’t come after me,” Taylor said—a statement that would later assume mythical significance in the supernatural theories that proliferated after Flight 19 vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Cox noticed something strange: The squadron’s transmissions were growing weaker. He realized that Taylor’s formation couldn’t be flying north from the Keys, which would have brought the group closer to his own position off Fort Lauderdale, on Florida’s east coast. Instead, the five Grumman TBF Avengers seemed to be straying farther from the coastline, toward the Bahamas and the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A flurry of confused communications ensued among ground units and those trying to advise Flight 19. Around 4:25 p.m., Taylor asked if anyone in the area had a radar screen that could pick up the group’s location in real time, but no such technology was readily available. An air-sea task unit based in Port Everglades, a seaport in Fort Lauderdale, alerted pilots and potential rescuers along the Florida coast of the squadron’s situation, simultaneously asking about available navigation equipment and requesting that Taylor switch to a less-trafficked emergency radio frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sheer volume of radio communications makes it difficult to know how much of the back and forth actually got through to Flight 19, but subsequent accident reports highlighted efforts to advise Taylor and his men to fly west, “into the sun.” “If these directions had been heard and carried out,” investigators later concluded, “we are certain this flight would have returned to base safely.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 4:45 p.m., Taylor relayed that the group planned to “fly north to make sure we are not over the Gulf of Mexico,” off Florida’s west coast. Half an hour later, he seemed to concur with outside observers’ advice, stating that the men would fly west “until we hit the beach or run out of gas.” Taylor reminded the other Avengers to remain in formation and, if gas got low, to ditch together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 6:04 p.m., Taylor made a crucial decision—one that likely doomed Flight 19. He concluded that they “didn’t go far enough east—turn around again—we may just as well turn around and go east again.” As lights were being lit at air stations and on ships up and down the Florida coast in hopes of guiding the men home, they were unknowingly flying in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When ground units were finally able to calculate a navigational fix (an estimate of the squadron’s coordinates) around 6 p.m., it was estimated to be within 100 miles of 29 degrees north latitude, 79 degrees west longitude—well north of the Bahamas and roughly east of Daytona Beach, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it is an agonizing irony that by this point, rescue units could no longer reach Flight 19 directly, but they could still hear garbled transmissions between the five planes. The last known message came from Ensign Joseph Bossi, one of the planes’ pilots, who tried to reach Taylor at 7:04 p.m. No response was heard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happened to Flight 19?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly what happened next remains a mystery. Did the men stay together, run out of fuel and successfully ditch their planes? If so, how long did they survive in the water? Taylor had been involved in three previous ditches, and the Avengers were almost certainly equipped with life rafts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Navy’s Board of Investigation later concluded “that the state of the sea in the area in which Flight 19 was presumed to have landed was rough and unfavorable for a water landing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome is that the men “ran out of gas and went into the ocean,” says John Bloom, director of the Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Museum, which hosts an annual memorial ceremony on the anniversary of the disappearance. But any certainty of what transpired after all communications ended was lost along with the men who died on Flight 19.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those killed included five pilots and nine crew members and trainees, some of them still teenagers, yet also veterans of World War II, which had ended just three months earlier. Taylor had more than 2,500 hours of flying experience, 61 of them in combat operations. Edward Joseph Powers Jr., a 26-year-old Marine captain, left behind a wife and child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tragedy of losing these 14 men was soon compounded after a fellow Navy pilot, Lieutenant Walter G. Jeffrey, volunteered to fly one of two Martin PBM-5 Mariners that departed from NAS Banana River, around 150 miles north of the Fort Lauderdale station, at 7:27 p.m., in the direction of the Avengers’ last presumed location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within half an hour, the Mariner suddenly fell off radio contact. Later that night, a ship in the vicinity reported seeing a “burst of flames” estimated to be 100 feet tall around 7:50 p.m. By the time searchers reached the site, no trace of the Mariner or its 13-man crew could be found. (Mariners were sometimes dubbed “flying gas tanks” due to their high fuel capacity and propensity to experience onboard fires.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With yet another plane missing, the search took on an additional layer of complexity. It lasted five days, with more than 200 planes scouring the Atlantic each day in hopes of finding the 27 men. Sightings of flares and flashes, of life jackets and rafts, fueled hope, even if they turned out to be imagined or unrelated debris. The cycle of hope and disappointment made headlines: On December 9, for example, the United Press news agency reported the discovery of six rafts, but officials soon retracted the sighting as a mistake. The Associated Press deemed the rescue mission “the most extensive search ever undertaken along the Atlantic Seaboard.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A mother’s fight to clear her son’s name&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Taylor’s mother, Katherine Taylor, received a telegram informing her that her son was missing, she was at the front of her classroom in Corpus Christi, the Texas city where she’d raised him. She was so devastated by the news that she walked out, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the central questions asked by both Katherine and the Navy was how Taylor, a seasoned pilot with extensive flying experience, could become so disoriented that he believed he was over the Keys. Within days, the Navy convened an investigation board, which focused on the testimony of those involved in the search along the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigators’ initial report, issued internally in January 1946, acknowledged that elements of the search protocol could have been improved, including coordination between units and rescuers’ ability to get a bearing on the flights. But it heavily weighted Taylor’s disorientation, noting that he wasn’t sure where the Florida peninsula was at the time, and that “this uncertainty influenced his later decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloom points out that the area was unfamiliar terrain for Taylor, who had transferred up from Miami the previous month. This may explain the pilot’s belief that he was over the Keys instead of the Bahamas. The squadron “never said another word about their compass not working,” Bloom says. “But then they did fly north thinking they’d see the peninsula, and when they didn’t, they thought they were out over the Gulf, so [Taylor] flies east.” What would have been obvious to aviators who had been based at the air station longer—that it would have been impossible for the group to be over the Keys so soon after taking off—seemed to be less apparent to the members of Flight 19 in their duress and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Navy was less magnanimous in its assessment of Taylor. “The leader of the flight became so hopelessly confused as to have suffered something akin to a mental aberration,” the chief of naval air training wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That conclusion did not sit well with Katherine. She believed there were holes in the Navy’s official version, which relied heavily on rescuers’ testimony in the absence of physical evidence and the aviators’ own accounts. As Katherine wrote in a letter to the mother of Walter Reed Parpart Jr., the 18-year-old radioman with Taylor on his plane, she didn’t believe the planes had been properly instructed to come west, or that their approximate location was ascertained and communicated to searchers in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It just can’t be possible that so many could disappear without a trace,” Katherine told a reporter in March 1946, after taking a trip to Florida to interview those involved in the rescue effort. “I shall never give up until I find out why!” She proved to be a tenacious advocate for this viewpoint, and officials concluded that she could not be swayed. “It is believed that Mrs. Taylor is emotionally unstable as a result of this disaster,” the Navy noted in its report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of Katherine’s key contentions centered around the ready plane, a standby aircraft that could have been sent up quickly from NAS Fort Lauderdale. In his testimony, Cox—the pilot who’d first realized Flight 19 was lost—testified that he’d returned to the station and asked Lieutenant Commander Donald J. Poole, the officer in charge of training flights there, if he could take the ready plane and fly northeast to the squadron’s likely position. Cox recalled that Poole “very definitely said no, that he didn’t think there was any use in sending it out then.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his own testimony, Poole outlined several reasons for his response, including waiting on the fix and fear that sending an additional plane would “complicate” communications from the ground. None of these explanations was particularly convincing to Katherine, nor to Cox himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My dad felt extremely strongly that he could locate the flight if he were allowed to go back up, and he was very frustrated that he wasn’t allowed to,” Cox’s daughter, Colby Cox, said in a 2021 History Channel documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloom, for his part, says, “They should have been proactively doing something. … The plane was up and ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Poole’s testimony provides some insight into the prevailing mindset about the situation’s severity. “I was still confident and certain that they would hit the coast before their gas supply ran out,” he told investigators. Lieutenant Commander Charles Kenyon, operations officer at NAS Fort Lauderdale, similarly testified that he “figured they were temporarily confused and … they would come back right on time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1947, after tireless lobbying by Katherine, the Navy modified its findings away from the initial focus on Taylor. A corrections review board concluded “that the flight disappeared for reasons or causes unknown.” This would stand as the official word on Flight 19 in the decades that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Navy closed the book on the case, a plethora of conspiracy theories emerged to fill the information void.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flight 19 conspiracy theories and the Bermuda Triangle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1950, the Associated Press published an article on plane and ship disappearances off the U.S.’s southeastern coast, including Flight 19, which it erroneously suggested had disappeared under complete radio silence. “It is the same big world the ancients knew into which men and their machines and ships can disappear without a trace,” the AP noted ominously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourteen years later, in 1964, the men’s magazine Argosy published an article by Vincent Gaddis titled “The Deadly Bermuda Triangle.” The piece was the first to popularize this term, which refers to a roughly 500,000- to 1.5-million-square-mile area of the North Atlantic Ocean, stretching from Florida’s east coast to Bermuda to the Greater Antilles. But the area Gaddis described had already developed a fearsome reputation among mariners of centuries past, who navigated a sometimes stormy and hurricane-prone section of the ocean, fueled by the warm currents of the Gulf Stream, without the benefit of accurate weather forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Did you know? The Tempest and the Bermuda Triangle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some scholars posit that William Shakespeare based his play The Tempest on accounts of the Sea Venture, an English ship wrecked off Bermuda in 1609.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Others disagree, suggesting the Bard was inspired by a near-shipwreck closer to home, or that he simply drew on his imagination.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Bermuda Triangle descriptor took hold in the popular imagination, it was applied retroactively to events that had taken place in the same radius, such as the disappearance of the USS Cyclops, a World War I transport ship that vanished in 1918 with its crew of 306 after transmitting a final message: “Weather fair. All well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Whatever this menace that lurks within a triangle of tragedy so close to home,” Gaddis wrote, “it was responsible for the most incredible mystery in the history of aviation—the lost patrol.” (Despite the staying power of this nickname for Flight 19, the group was a squadron on a training run, not a patrol.) In his best-selling 1974 book, The Bermuda Triangle, Charles Berlitz, a chronicler of paranormal phenomena, deemed the loss of the Avengers and the Mariner “the first occasion in which planes were affected,” building on his long—and largely unreliable—list of ships that had vanished in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the Mariner disappeared in approximately the same vicinity as Flight 19 fueled theories of supernatural intervention, with outside observers ignoring the fact that a rescue plane would naturally be sent to its target’s presumed location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Berlitz also cited a request by Taylor to be dismissed from the assignment ahead of time as a “presentiment of disaster.” But those who actually saw Taylor on the day of the training run didn’t notice anything amiss, and the lieutenant never officially escalated his request. Berlitz also falsely relayed Taylor’s message of “don’t come after me” as “don’t come after me … they look like they are from outer space.” That line really clinched the legend of the Bermuda Triangle: “This final mystery, with its suggestion of other-world interference, is echoed in more than a few of the other disappearances,” Berlitz wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloom, for his part, dismisses such speculation. “I don’t believe in fiction,” he says. “There’s a lot of misstatements about what was said when they were out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1977 Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind depicted the crew of Flight 19 re-emerging years later, without aging, after being abducted by aliens. Musicians have tackled the legend of the Bermuda Triangle, too: Fleetwood Mac sang of “all of these ships and planes, a great big mystery that cannot be explained,” while Barry Manilow mused on a place that “makes people disappear.” Numerous television dramas and documentaries have sustained this block of ocean’s notoriety well into contemporary times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s view, “There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean.” The myth is fueled by fanciful interpretations of the many unknowns of such disappearances, which can often be attributed to environmental factors like tropical storms and hurricanes, sudden changes in weather, and shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real—and perhaps most unsolvable—mysteries of Flight 19 are what Taylor experienced that day that led him off course in the first place, and what happened after the last radio call from Bossi to Taylor at 7:04 p.m. Though the emergence of conspiracy theories has obscured this, many aviation and naval tragedies have resulted from a confluence of banal mishaps and missed opportunities. What might have happened if the ready plane flew sooner? Or if the location fix had come in earlier and been heard by Flight 19?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all the fabrications and exaggerations that Gaddis detailed in his 1964 magazine article, one statement rings all too true today: “The sea guards well her secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programs running in windowing environments, applications as we used to know them, have more complicated requirements than those run from a command line. Rather than embed all the resources they require for windows, menus and the rest in a single file, Mac OS broke new ground by putting those into resources stored in the app’s resource fork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is QuarkXPress version 4.11 from around 2000, with its resources displayed in the resource editor ResEdit. Executable code was also stored in CODE resources, and every file contained type and creator information to support the illusions created by the Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Mac OS X was designed, it switched to the bundle structure inherited from NeXTSTEP. Instead of this multitude of resources, apps consisted of a hierarchy of directories containing files of executable code, and those with what had in Mac OS been supporting resources. Those app bundles came to adopt a standard form, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bundle name has the extension .app, and contains a single directory Contents. Within that, the executable code is in the MacOS directory, which may contain both the main executable for the GUI app and any bundled command tools provided. Another directory contains Resources, including the app’s custom icon, and components of its GUI. In some apps, there’s another directory of Frameworks containing dylibs (libraries).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also two important files, Info.plist and PkgInfo. The latter contains the same type and creator information inherited from Classic Mac OS, and apparently isn’t mandatory although it appears universal. The information property list is essential, as it specifies the names of the executable and its icon file in Resources, the minimum version of macOS required, type declarations of the app’s documents, version numbers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running a command tool in macOS, its Mach-O executable is launched by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;, whose purpose is to run code. Launching an app is more demanding, although the app’s executable is still launched by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;. Before that can happen, macOS starts the launch process using LaunchServices and RunningBoard, which rely on information obtained from Info.plist and other components in the app bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;macOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This structure remained stable until the introduction of code signatures in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007. Accommodating those added a directory named _CodeSignature containing the signature in a CodeResources file. That includes code directory hashes (CDHashes) to check the integrity of the contents of the app bundle. Apps distributed by the App Store include a store receipt in another directory, _MASReceipt. Since 2018, when Apple introduced notarization, the ‘ticket’ issued by Apple can be ‘stapled’ into the app bundle as the file CodeResources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many apps come with additional items that might in the past have been installed by them in their Library/Application Support folders and elsewhere, but are now included in the app bundle. These can include the following directories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Library, containing folders of LaunchDaemons and LoginItems that would previously have been installed in either the main Library folder, or that in the user’s Home folder;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;XPCServices, for executable code that the app uses to provide specific services;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugins, for some types of app extension (Appex);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extensions, for other types of app extension, including app intents.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may also come across other components, including a version.plist in Apple’s apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This centralisation of components in the app bundle has brought several benefits. Being self-contained, apps are easier to install and update, and cleaner to remove. Their components are less likely to go missing, and most of all they’re held within the protection of the app’s signature and notarisation, an important improvement in security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assembling these into a diagram shows how the anatomy of an app has grown over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Components shown in pale yellow are either mandatory or essentially universal. Those shown in green are found in apps distributed through the App Store, while that shown in blue is the stapled notarisation ticket (optional). You will also see additional folders and components such as Automator workflows, scripts, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference in structure between apps built for current Intel and Arm architectures. That’s because binaries in the MacOS folder (and executable code in other directories like Frameworks, XPCServices and Plugins) contain platform-specific code in a single Mach-O executable. Thus, an app that’s Universal and runs native on both architectures includes code for both in its single ‘fat’ code file, and they even have separate signatures stored within common files.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Goodbye, Microsoft: Schleswig-Holstein relies on Open Source and saves millions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schleswig-Holstein saves 15 million euros in license costs by migrating from Microsoft to free software. The conversion is significantly cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state administration of Schleswig-Holstein is making a remarkable U-turn in its IT strategy and consistently relying on open source. After the migration from proprietary Microsoft software to free solutions was initially accompanied by problems and criticism, Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter (CDU) can now report a significant success: According to his ministry, the state will save over 15 million euros in license costs for Windows, Microsoft Office &amp;amp; Co. next year alone. It is expected to be similar in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, there would be one-time investments of nine million euros in 2026, explained the Ministry of Digitalization to the Kieler Nachrichten. These would have to be made for the conversion of workplaces and the further development of solutions with free software in the next 12 months. Given the annual savings, this sum will pay for itself in less than a year. In the past, the state transferred millions to the US company Microsoft, primarily for the use of office software and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The department sees the departure from this "vendor lock-in" – the dependence on a single large provider – as a clear signal for greater independence and sustainable digitalization. The financial incentive now underscores that digital sovereignty can be not only a political buzzword but also an economic gain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Almost 80 percent of licenses canceled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The numbers speak for themselves: outside the tax administration, almost 80 percent of workplaces in the state administration have already been switched to the open-source office software LibreOffice. Schrödter thus confirms a course that reduces technical and economic dependence on individual manufacturers. The consequence of the conversion was already evident recently, as Schrödter emphasized in an interview with c't. Regarding the status of Microsoft license cancellations, he said: "We are at almost 80, without the tax administration." For tax matters, the state finance ministers have "given themselves a clear timetable for the switch." Recently, the Christian Democrat also emphasized, according to the Südtiroler Wirtschaftszeitung, that the state has entered a marathon, not just a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining 20 percent of workplaces are currently still dependent on Microsoft programs such as Word or Excel, as there is a technical dependency on these programs in certain specialized applications. According to Schrödter, however, the successive conversion of these remaining computers is the stated goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Opposition sees challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the savings and the almost completed migration in large parts of the administration, the opposition continues to criticize the quality of the conversion. SPD state parliament member Kianusch Stender pointed out to the Kieler Nachrichten: "It may be that on paper 80 percent of workplaces have been converted. But far fewer than 80 percent of employees can now work with them properly." Errors in the migration are "still present." The initial difficulties in introducing the open-source programs have apparently led to ongoing frustration among some employees in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videos by heise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Green state parliament member Jan Kürschner also admitted in an interview with heise online that such a comprehensive conversion would not go without friction. But he emphasized the long-term nature of the project and the necessity of fundamentally rethinking administrative processes: "With the change, there is an opportunity to truly rethink the administration and free ourselves from old burdens. That is the great added value." If only a one-to-one conversion is made, it might certainly "stumble at one point or another." But those who truly optimize administrative processes will likely find in the end: "Open source is the better way."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge now is to resolve the initial migration problems and acceptance difficulties and to further develop the open-source solutions so that they fully meet the requirements of a modern state administration. The savings achieved give Schleswig-Holstein more financial leeway for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(nie)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scala 3 slowed us down?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this clickbait? Not really. &lt;lb/&gt; Is this the fault of the language or the compiler? Definitely not. &lt;lb/&gt; Rather, it was part of a rushed migration. Sharing the lessons learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was refreshing one of our services. Part of this process was to migrate codebase from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3. I’ve done this a few times before and overall had a positive experience. Well, at least until we talk about projects with macro wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service in question had no macros at all, but it was at the heart of data ingestion, so performance was not an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did it as usual - updating dependencies, compiler options and some type/syntax changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then after resolving few tricky implicit resolutions and config derivations, project compiled on Scala 3.7.3 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All tests passed, end-to-end flow locally works perfectly fine, so I decided to roll out the changes in a testing environment. Similarly, no issues at all. No concerning logs, all metrics ranging from infrastructure, through JVM up to application level look healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I began a staged rollout. Again, all seem good. I kept observing the service but it looked like my job is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, as you probably can guess, it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The mysterious slowdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 5-6 hours, Kafka lag started increasing on a few environments. Of course, this wasn’t something new. Most often it is caused by a spike of data. We have pretty advanced machinery to deal with that. Usually the lag resolves by itself without any manual action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this time something was off. Upstream load turned out to be relatively modest, yet we needed much more instances of the service - meaning the processing rate per instance dropped. I was confused to say the least. Why would it decrease the processing rate just on these environments?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, we decided to rollback the changes - this brought the rate back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digging deeper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came back to testing. In particular, load testing. However similarly as on production environments I did not notice regression. So I played around with different payloads and granularity of messages. To my surprise, for more fine-grained, heterogeneous workloads, the processing rate significantly dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, I had no idea why it would happen, but my bet was in the dependencies. Therefore, I tried one-by-one, reverting the serialization library, database SDK, base Docker image and even config libraries. None of these made any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This made me pull out the big guns. I profiled the service using async-profiler and indeed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU profile looked vastly different on Scala 3 than on 2.13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JVM-level CPU time was now dominated by JIT compiler while application-level by decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the top of Scala 3 flamegraph I noticed a long quicklens call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What used to be transparent (frankly, I didn’t even realize we used the library), now took almost half of the total CPU time. I compared how it looks on Scala 2.13 and it was barely noticeable with around 0.5% samples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out there was indeed a subtle bug making chained evaluations inefficient in Scala 3. This also explained why the JVM spent so much time compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After upgrading the library, performance and CPU characteristics on Scala 3 became indistinguishable from Scala 2.13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the details of the bug are pretty interesting(hats off to the SoftwareMill team for catching it!), that’s not my point here. I want to emphasize that libraries can behave very differently between Scala versions, especially when they rely on meta-programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if your migration is seamless and the service runs fine on Scala 3 - when performance is not just a nice-to-have, do not assume. Know your hotspots and benchmark them. Otherwise, your code will benchmark you, revealing bottlenecks in places you didn’t even know existed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've already discussed some object-level locks (specifically, relation-level locks), as well as row-level locks with their connection to object-level locks and also explored wait queues, which are not always fair.&lt;lb/&gt;We have a hodgepodge this time. We'll start with deadlocks (actually, I planned to discuss them last time, but that article was excessively long in itself), then briefly review object-level locks left and finally discuss predicate locks.&lt;lb/&gt;When using locks, we can confront a deadlock. It occurs when one transaction tries to acquire a resource that is already in use by another transaction, while the second transaction tries to acquire a resource that is in use by the first. The figure on the left below illustrates this: solid-line arrows indicate acquired resources, while dashed-line arrows show attempts to acquire a resource that is already in use.&lt;lb/&gt;To visualize a deadlock, it is convenient to build the wait-for graph. To do this, we remove specific resources, leave only transactions and indicate which transaction waits for which other. If a graph contains a cycle (from a vertex, we can get to itself in a walk along arrows), this is a deadlock.&lt;lb/&gt;A deadlock can certainly occur not only for two transactions, but for any larger number of them.&lt;lb/&gt;If a deadlock occured, the involved transactions can do nothing but wait infinitely. Therefore, all DBMS, including PostgreSQL, track locks automatically.&lt;lb/&gt;The check, however, requires a certain effort, and it's undesirable to make it each time a new lock is requested (deadlocks are pretty infrequent after all). So, when a process tries to acquire a lock, but cannot, it queues and «falls asleep», but sets the timer to the value specified in the deadlock_timeout parameter (1 second by default). If the resource gets free earlier, this is fine and we skimp on the check. But if on expiration of deadlock_timeout, the wait continues, the waiting process will wake up and initiate the check.&lt;lb/&gt;If the check (which consists in building the wait-for graph and searching it for cycles) does not detect deadlocks, it continues sleeping, this time «until final victory».&lt;lb/&gt;But if a deadlock is detected, one of the transactions (in most cases, the one that initiated the check) is forced to abort. This releases the locks it acquired and enables other transactions to continue.&lt;lb/&gt;Deadlocks usually mean that the application is designed incorrectly. There are two ways to detect such situations: first, messages will occur in the server log and second, the value of&lt;lb/&gt;Usually deadlocks are caused by an inconsistent order of locking table rows.&lt;lb/&gt;Let's consider a simple example. The first transaction is going to transfer 100 rubles from the first account to the second one. To this end, the transaction reduces the first account:&lt;lb/&gt;At the same time, the second transaction is going to transfer 10 rubles from the second account to the first one. And it starts with reducing the second account:&lt;lb/&gt;Now the first transaction tries to increase the second account, but detects a lock on the row.&lt;lb/&gt;Then the second transaction tries to increase the first account, but also gets blocked.&lt;lb/&gt;So a circular wait arises, which won't end on its own. In a second, the first transaction, which cannot access the resource yet, initiates a check for a deadlock and is forced to abort by the server.&lt;lb/&gt;Now the second transaction can continue.&lt;lb/&gt;The correct way to perform such operations is to lock resources in the same order. For example: in this case, accounts can be locked in ascending order of their numbers.&lt;lb/&gt;Sometimes we can get a deadlock in situations where, seemingly, it could never occur. For example: it is convenient and usual to treat SQL commands as atomic, but the UPDATE command locks rows as they are updated. This does not happen instantaneously. Therefore, if the order in which a command updates rows is inconsistent with the order in which another command does this, a deadlock can occur.&lt;lb/&gt;Although such a situation is unlikely, it can still occur. To reproduce it, we will create an index on the&lt;lb/&gt;To be able to watch what happens, let's create a function that increases the passed value, but very-very slowly, for as long as an entire second:&lt;lb/&gt;We will also need the&lt;lb/&gt;The first UPDATE command will update the entire table. The execution plan is evident — it is sequential scan:&lt;lb/&gt;Since tuples on the table page are located in ascending order of the amount (exactly how we added them), they will also be updated in the same order. Let the update start.&lt;lb/&gt;At the same time, in another session we'll forbid sequential scans:&lt;lb/&gt;In this case, for the next UPDATE operator, the planner decides to use index scan:&lt;lb/&gt;The second and third rows meet the condition, and since the index is built in descending order of the amount, the rows will be updated in a reverse order.&lt;lb/&gt;Let's run the next update.&lt;lb/&gt;A quick look into the table page shows that the first operator already managed to update the first row (0,1) and the second operator updated the last row (0,3):&lt;lb/&gt;One more second elapses. The first operator updated the second row, and the second one would like to do the same, but cannot.&lt;lb/&gt;Now the first operator would like to update the last table row, but it is already locked by the second operator. Hence a deadlock.&lt;lb/&gt;One of the transactions aborts:&lt;lb/&gt;And the second one continues:&lt;lb/&gt;This completes a talk on deadlocks, and we proceed to the remaining object-level locks.&lt;lb/&gt;When we need to lock a resource that is not a relation in the meaning of PostgreSQL, locks of the&lt;lb/&gt;Illustrating this by a simple example. Let's start a transaction and create a table in it:&lt;lb/&gt;Now let's see what locks of the&lt;lb/&gt;To figure out what in particular is locked here, we need to look at three fields:&lt;lb/&gt;We work as&lt;lb/&gt;Now let's clarify the second line. The database is specified, and it is&lt;lb/&gt;This shows that the&lt;lb/&gt;So, we've seen that when an object is created, the owner role and schema in which the object is created get locked (in a shared mode). And this is reasonable: otherwise, someone could drop the role or schema while the transaction is not completed yet.&lt;lb/&gt;When the number of rows in a relation (table, index or materialized view) increases, PostgreSQL can use free space in available pages for inserts, but evidently, once new pages also have to be added. Physically they are added at the end of the appropriate file. And this is meant by a relation extension.&lt;lb/&gt;To ensure that two processes do not rush to add pages simultaneously, the extension process is protected by a specialized lock of the&lt;lb/&gt;This lock is certainly released without waiting for completion of the transaction.&lt;lb/&gt;Page-level locks of the&lt;lb/&gt;GIN indexes enable us to accelerate search in compound values, for instance: words in text documents (or array elements). To a first approximation, these indexes can be represented as a regular B-tree that stores separate words from the documents rather than the documents themselves. Therefore, when a new document is added, the index has to be rebuilt pretty much in order to add there each new word from the document.&lt;lb/&gt;For better performance, GIN index has a postponed insert feature, which is turned on by the&lt;lb/&gt;To prevent moving from the pending list to the main index by several processes simultaneously, for the duration of moving, the index metapage gets locked in an exclusive mode. This does not hinder regular use of the index.&lt;lb/&gt;Unlike other locks (such as relation-level locks), advisory locks are never acquired automatically — the application developer controls them. They are useful when, for instance, an application for some reason needs a locking logic that is not in line with the standard logic of regular locks.&lt;lb/&gt;Assume we have a hypothetical resource that does not match any database object (which we could lock using commands such as SELECT FOR or LOCK TABLE). We need to devise a numeric identifier for it. If a resource has a unique name, a simple option is to use its hash code:&lt;lb/&gt;This is how we have the lock acquired:&lt;lb/&gt;As usual, information on locks is available in&lt;lb/&gt;For locking to be really effective, other processes must also acquire a lock on the resource prior to accessing it. Evidently the application must ensure that this rule is observed.&lt;lb/&gt;In the above example, the lock will be held through the end of the session rather than the transaction, as usual.&lt;lb/&gt;And we need to explicitly release it:&lt;lb/&gt;A rich collection of functions to work with advisory locks is available for all intents and purposes:&lt;lb/&gt;A collection of&lt;lb/&gt;The predicate lock term occurred long ago, when early DBMS made first attempts to implement complete isolation based on locks (the Serializable level, although there was no SQL standard at that time). The issue they confronted then was that even locking of all read and updated rows did not ensure complete isolation: new rows that meet the same selection conditions can occur in the table, which causes phantoms to arise (see the article on isolation).&lt;lb/&gt;The idea of predicate locks was to lock predicates rather than rows. If during execution of a query with the condition a &amp;gt; 10 we lock the a &amp;gt; 10 predicate, this won't allow us to add new rows that meet the condition to the table and will enable us to avoid phantoms. The issue is that this problem is computationally complicated; in practice, it can be solved only for very simple predicates.&lt;lb/&gt;In PostgreSQL, the Serializable level is implemented differently, on top of the available isolation based on data snapshots. Although the predicate lock term is still used, its meaning drastically changed. Actually these «locks» block nothing; they are used to track data dependencies between transactions.&lt;lb/&gt;It is proved that snapshot isolation permits an inconsistent write (write skew) anomaly and a read-only transaction anomaly, but any other anomalies are impossible. To figure out that we deal with one of the two above anomalies, we can analyze dependencies between transactions and discover certain patterns there.&lt;lb/&gt;Dependencies of two kinds are of interest to us:&lt;lb/&gt;We can track WR dependencies using already available regular locks, but RW dependencies have to be tracked specially.&lt;lb/&gt;To reiterate, despite the name, predicate locks bock nothing. A check is performed at the transaction commit instead, and if a suspicious sequence of dependencies that may indicate an anomaly is discovered, the transaction aborts.&lt;lb/&gt;Let's look at how predicate locks are handled. To do this, we'll create a table with a pretty large number of locks and an index on it.&lt;lb/&gt;If a query is executed using sequential scan of the entire table, a predicate lock on the entire table gets acquired (even if not all rows meet the filtering condition).&lt;lb/&gt;All predicate locks are acquired in one special mode — SIReadLock (Serializable Isolation Read):&lt;lb/&gt;But if a query is executed using index scan, the situation changes for the better. If we deal with a B-tree, it is sufficient to have a lock acquired on the rows read and on the leaf index pages walked through — this allows us to track not only specific values, but all the range read.&lt;lb/&gt;Note a few complexities.&lt;lb/&gt;First, a separate lock is created for each read tuple, and the number of such tuples can potentially be very large. The total number of predicate locks in the system is limited by the product of parameter values: max_pred_locks_per_transaction × max_connections (the default values are 64 and 100, respectively). The memory for these locks is allocated at the server start; an attempt to exceed this limit will result in errors.&lt;lb/&gt;Therefore, escalation is used for predicate locks (and only for them!). Prior to PostgreSQL 10, the limitations were hard coded, but starting this version, we can control the escalation through parameters. If the number of tuple locks related to one page exceeds max_pred_locks_per_page, these locks are replaced with one page-level lock. Consider an example:&lt;lb/&gt;We see one lock of the&lt;lb/&gt;Likewise, if the number of locks on pages related to one relation exceeds max_pred_locks_per_relation, these locks are replaced with one relation-level lock.&lt;lb/&gt;There are no other levels: predicate locks are acquired only for relations, pages and tuples and always in the SIReadLock mode.&lt;lb/&gt;Certainly, escalation of locks inevitably results in an increase of the number of transactions that falsely terminate with a serialization error, and eventually, the system throuthput will decrease. Here you need to balance RAM consumption and performance.&lt;lb/&gt;The second complexity is that different operations with an index (for instance, due to splits of index pages when new rows are inserted) change the number of leaf pages that cover the range read. But the implementation takes this into account:&lt;lb/&gt;By the way, predicate locks are not always released immediately on completion of the transaction since they are needed to track dependencies between several transactions. But anyway, they are controlled automatically.&lt;lb/&gt;By no means all types of indexes in PostgreSQL support predicate locks. Before PostgreSQL 11, only B-trees could boast of this, but that version improved the situation: hash, GiST and GIN indexes were added to the list. If index access is used, but the index does not support predicate locks, a lock on the entire index is acquired. This, certainly, also increases the number of false aborts of transactions.&lt;lb/&gt;Finally, note that it's the use of predicate locks that limits all transactions to working at the Serializable level in order to ensure complete isolation. If a certain transaction uses a different level, it just won't acquire (and check) predicate locks.&lt;lb/&gt;Read on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a hodgepodge this time. We'll start with deadlocks (actually, I planned to discuss them last time, but that article was excessively long in itself), then briefly review object-level locks left and finally discuss predicate locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Deadlocks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using locks, we can confront a deadlock. It occurs when one transaction tries to acquire a resource that is already in use by another transaction, while the second transaction tries to acquire a resource that is in use by the first. The figure on the left below illustrates this: solid-line arrows indicate acquired resources, while dashed-line arrows show attempts to acquire a resource that is already in use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To visualize a deadlock, it is convenient to build the wait-for graph. To do this, we remove specific resources, leave only transactions and indicate which transaction waits for which other. If a graph contains a cycle (from a vertex, we can get to itself in a walk along arrows), this is a deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deadlock can certainly occur not only for two transactions, but for any larger number of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a deadlock occured, the involved transactions can do nothing but wait infinitely. Therefore, all DBMS, including PostgreSQL, track locks automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The check, however, requires a certain effort, and it's undesirable to make it each time a new lock is requested (deadlocks are pretty infrequent after all). So, when a process tries to acquire a lock, but cannot, it queues and «falls asleep», but sets the timer to the value specified in the deadlock_timeout parameter (1 second by default). If the resource gets free earlier, this is fine and we skimp on the check. But if on expiration of deadlock_timeout, the wait continues, the waiting process will wake up and initiate the check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the check (which consists in building the wait-for graph and searching it for cycles) does not detect deadlocks, it continues sleeping, this time «until final victory».&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Earlier, I was fairly reproached in the comments for not mentioning the lock_timeout parameter, which affects any operator and allows avoiding an infinitely long wait: if a lock cannot be acquired during the time specified, the operator terminates with a&lt;code&gt;lock_not_available&lt;/code&gt;error. Do not confuse this parameter with statement_timeout, which limits the total time to execute the operator, no matter whether the latter waits for a lock or does a regular work.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if a deadlock is detected, one of the transactions (in most cases, the one that initiated the check) is forced to abort. This releases the locks it acquired and enables other transactions to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadlocks usually mean that the application is designed incorrectly. There are two ways to detect such situations: first, messages will occur in the server log and second, the value of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_stat_database.deadlocks&lt;/code&gt; will increase.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example of deadlocking&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually deadlocks are caused by an inconsistent order of locking table rows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's consider a simple example. The first transaction is going to transfer 100 rubles from the first account to the second one. To this end, the transaction reduces the first account:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; BEGIN;
=&amp;gt; UPDATE accounts SET amount = amount - 100.00 WHERE acc_no = 1;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;UPDATE 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the second transaction is going to transfer 10 rubles from the second account to the first one. And it starts with reducing the second account:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; BEGIN;
|  =&amp;gt; UPDATE accounts SET amount = amount - 10.00 WHERE acc_no = 2;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  UPDATE 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the first transaction tries to increase the second account, but detects a lock on the row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; UPDATE accounts SET amount = amount + 100.00 WHERE acc_no = 2;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the second transaction tries to increase the first account, but also gets blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; UPDATE accounts SET amount = amount + 10.00 WHERE acc_no = 1;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a circular wait arises, which won't end on its own. In a second, the first transaction, which cannot access the resource yet, initiates a check for a deadlock and is forced to abort by the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ERROR:  deadlock detected
DETAIL:  Process 16477 waits for ShareLock on transaction 530695; blocked by process 16513.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the second transaction can continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  UPDATE 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; ROLLBACK;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; ROLLBACK;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correct way to perform such operations is to lock resources in the same order. For example: in this case, accounts can be locked in ascending order of their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Deadlock of two UPDATE commands&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we can get a deadlock in situations where, seemingly, it could never occur. For example: it is convenient and usual to treat SQL commands as atomic, but the UPDATE command locks rows as they are updated. This does not happen instantaneously. Therefore, if the order in which a command updates rows is inconsistent with the order in which another command does this, a deadlock can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although such a situation is unlikely, it can still occur. To reproduce it, we will create an index on the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;amount&lt;/code&gt; column in descending order of &lt;code&gt;amount&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; CREATE INDEX ON accounts(amount DESC);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to watch what happens, let's create a function that increases the passed value, but very-very slowly, for as long as an entire second:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; CREATE FUNCTION inc_slow(n numeric) RETURNS numeric AS $$
  SELECT pg_sleep(1);
  SELECT n + 100.00;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also need the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pgrowlocks&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; CREATE EXTENSION pgrowlocks;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first UPDATE command will update the entire table. The execution plan is evident — it is sequential scan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; EXPLAIN (costs off)
|  UPDATE accounts SET amount = inc_slow(amount);

|   Update on accounts
|     -&amp;gt;  Seq Scan on accounts

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since tuples on the table page are located in ascending order of the amount (exactly how we added them), they will also be updated in the same order. Let the update start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; UPDATE accounts SET amount = inc_slow(amount);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in another session we'll forbid sequential scans:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;||     =&amp;gt; SET enable_seqscan = off;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, for the next UPDATE operator, the planner decides to use index scan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;||     =&amp;gt; EXPLAIN (costs off)
||     UPDATE accounts SET amount = inc_slow(amount) WHERE amount &amp;gt; 100.00;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second and third rows meet the condition, and since the index is built in descending order of the amount, the rows will be updated in a reverse order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's run the next update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;||     =&amp;gt; UPDATE accounts SET amount = inc_slow(amount) WHERE amount &amp;gt; 100.00;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick look into the table page shows that the first operator already managed to update the first row (0,1) and the second operator updated the last row (0,3):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT * FROM pgrowlocks('accounts') \gx

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more second elapses. The first operator updated the second row, and the second one would like to do the same, but cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT * FROM pgrowlocks('accounts') \gx

Almost whatever we can think of can refer to such resources: tablespaces, subscriptions, schemas, enumerated data types and so on. Roughly, this is everything that can be found in the system catalog.&lt;p&gt;Illustrating this by a simple example. Let's start a transaction and create a table in it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; BEGIN;
=&amp;gt; CREATE TABLE example(n integer);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's see what locks of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; type appeared in &lt;code&gt;pg_locks&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT
  database,
  (SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE oid = l.database) AS dbname,
  classid,
  (SELECT relname FROM pg_class WHERE oid = l.classid) AS classname,
  objid,
  mode,
  granted
FROM pg_locks l
WHERE l.locktype = 'object' AND l.pid = pg_backend_pid();

    16386 | test   |    2615 | pg_namespace |  2200 | AccessShareLock | t
(2 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out what in particular is locked here, we need to look at three fields:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;database&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;classid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;objid&lt;/code&gt;. We start with the first line.&lt;code&gt;database&lt;/code&gt; is the OID of the database that the resource being locked relates to. In this case, this column contains zero. It means that we deal with a global object, which is not specific to any database.&lt;code&gt;classid&lt;/code&gt; contains the OID from &lt;code&gt;pg_class&lt;/code&gt; that matches the name of the system catalog table that actually determines the resource type. In this case, it is &lt;code&gt;pg_authid&lt;/code&gt;, that is, a role (user) is the resource.&lt;code&gt;objid&lt;/code&gt; contains the OID from the system catalog table indicated by &lt;code&gt;classid&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT rolname FROM pg_authid WHERE oid = 16384;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; rolname
---------
 student
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We work as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;student&lt;/code&gt;, and this is exactly the role locked.&lt;p&gt;Now let's clarify the second line. The database is specified, and it is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;, to which we are connected.&lt;code&gt;classid&lt;/code&gt; indicates the &lt;code&gt;pg_namespace&lt;/code&gt; table, which contains schemas.&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT nspname FROM pg_namespace WHERE oid = 2200;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; nspname
---------
 public
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; schema is locked.&lt;p&gt;So, we've seen that when an object is created, the owner role and schema in which the object is created get locked (in a shared mode). And this is reasonable: otherwise, someone could drop the role or schema while the transaction is not completed yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; ROLLBACK;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Lock on relation extension&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the number of rows in a relation (table, index or materialized view) increases, PostgreSQL can use free space in available pages for inserts, but evidently, once new pages also have to be added. Physically they are added at the end of the appropriate file. And this is meant by a relation extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that two processes do not rush to add pages simultaneously, the extension process is protected by a specialized lock of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;extend&lt;/code&gt; type. The same lock is used when vacuuming indexes for other processes to be unable to add pages during the scan.&lt;p&gt;This lock is certainly released without waiting for completion of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Earlier, tables could extend only by one page at a time. This caused issues during simultaneous row inserts by several processes; therefore, starting with PostgreSQL 9.6, several pages are added to tables at once (in proportion to the number of waiting processes, but not greater than 512).&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Page lock&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page-level locks of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; type are used in the only case (aside from predicate locks, to be discussed later).&lt;p&gt;GIN indexes enable us to accelerate search in compound values, for instance: words in text documents (or array elements). To a first approximation, these indexes can be represented as a regular B-tree that stores separate words from the documents rather than the documents themselves. Therefore, when a new document is added, the index has to be rebuilt pretty much in order to add there each new word from the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better performance, GIN index has a postponed insert feature, which is turned on by the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fastupdate&lt;/code&gt; storage parameter. New words are quickly added to an unordered pending list first, and after a while, everything accumulated is moved to the main index structure. The gains are due to a high probability of occurrence of the same words in different documents.&lt;p&gt;To prevent moving from the pending list to the main index by several processes simultaneously, for the duration of moving, the index metapage gets locked in an exclusive mode. This does not hinder regular use of the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Advisory locks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other locks (such as relation-level locks), advisory locks are never acquired automatically — the application developer controls them. They are useful when, for instance, an application for some reason needs a locking logic that is not in line with the standard logic of regular locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume we have a hypothetical resource that does not match any database object (which we could lock using commands such as SELECT FOR or LOCK TABLE). We need to devise a numeric identifier for it. If a resource has a unique name, a simple option is to use its hash code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT hashtext('resource1');

 991601810
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how we have the lock acquired:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; BEGIN;
=&amp;gt; SELECT pg_advisory_lock(hashtext('resource1'));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, information on locks is available in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_locks&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT locktype, objid, mode, granted 
FROM pg_locks WHERE locktype = 'advisory' AND pid = pg_backend_pid();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; locktype |   objid   |     mode      | granted 
----------+-----------+---------------+---------
 advisory | 991601810 | ExclusiveLock | t
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;For locking to be really effective, other processes must also acquire a lock on the resource prior to accessing it. Evidently the application must ensure that this rule is observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the lock will be held through the end of the session rather than the transaction, as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; COMMIT;
=&amp;gt; SELECT locktype, objid, mode, granted 
FROM pg_locks WHERE locktype = 'advisory' AND pid = pg_backend_pid();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; locktype |   objid   |     mode      | granted 
----------+-----------+---------------+---------
 advisory | 991601810 | ExclusiveLock | t
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we need to explicitly release it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('resource1'));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rich collection of functions to work with advisory locks is available for all intents and purposes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_advisory_lock_shared&lt;/code&gt;has a shared lock acquired.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_advisory_xact_lock&lt;/code&gt;(and&lt;code&gt;pg_advisory_xact_lock_shared&lt;/code&gt;) has a shared lock acquired up to the end of the transaction.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_try_advisory_lock&lt;/code&gt;(as well as&lt;code&gt;pg_try_advisory_xact_lock&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;pg_try_advisory_xact_lock_shared&lt;/code&gt;) does not wait for a lock, but returns&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;if a lock could not be acquired immediately.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collection of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_&lt;/code&gt; functions is one more technique to avoid waiting for a lock, in addition to those listed in the last article.&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Predicate locks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The predicate lock term occurred long ago, when early DBMS made first attempts to implement complete isolation based on locks (the Serializable level, although there was no SQL standard at that time). The issue they confronted then was that even locking of all read and updated rows did not ensure complete isolation: new rows that meet the same selection conditions can occur in the table, which causes phantoms to arise (see the article on isolation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of predicate locks was to lock predicates rather than rows. If during execution of a query with the condition a &amp;gt; 10 we lock the a &amp;gt; 10 predicate, this won't allow us to add new rows that meet the condition to the table and will enable us to avoid phantoms. The issue is that this problem is computationally complicated; in practice, it can be solved only for very simple predicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PostgreSQL, the Serializable level is implemented differently, on top of the available isolation based on data snapshots. Although the predicate lock term is still used, its meaning drastically changed. Actually these «locks» block nothing; they are used to track data dependencies between transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is proved that snapshot isolation permits an inconsistent write (write skew) anomaly and a read-only transaction anomaly, but any other anomalies are impossible. To figure out that we deal with one of the two above anomalies, we can analyze dependencies between transactions and discover certain patterns there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dependencies of two kinds are of interest to us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;One transaction reads a row that is then updated by the second transaction (RW dependency).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;One transaction updates a row that is then read by the second transaction (WR dependency).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can track WR dependencies using already available regular locks, but RW dependencies have to be tracked specially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, despite the name, predicate locks bock nothing. A check is performed at the transaction commit instead, and if a suspicious sequence of dependencies that may indicate an anomaly is discovered, the transaction aborts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at how predicate locks are handled. To do this, we'll create a table with a pretty large number of locks and an index on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; CREATE TABLE pred(n integer);
=&amp;gt; INSERT INTO pred(n) SELECT g.n FROM generate_series(1,10000) g(n);
=&amp;gt; CREATE INDEX ON pred(n) WITH (fillfactor = 10);
=&amp;gt; ANALYZE pred;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a query is executed using sequential scan of the entire table, a predicate lock on the entire table gets acquired (even if not all rows meet the filtering condition).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; SELECT pg_backend_pid();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|   pg_backend_pid 
|  ----------------
|            12763
|  (1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
|  =&amp;gt; EXPLAIN (analyze, costs off)
|    SELECT * FROM pred WHERE n &amp;gt; 100;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|                             QUERY PLAN                           
|  ----------------------------------------------------------------
|   Seq Scan on pred (actual time=0.047..12.709 rows=9900 loops=1)
|     Filter: (n &amp;gt; 100)
|     Rows Removed by Filter: 100
|   Planning Time: 0.190 ms
|   Execution Time: 15.244 ms
|  (5 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;All predicate locks are acquired in one special mode — SIReadLock (Serializable Isolation Read):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT locktype, relation::regclass, page, tuple
FROM pg_locks WHERE mode = 'SIReadLock' AND pid = 12763;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; locktype | relation | page | tuple 
----------+----------+------+-------
 relation | pred     |      |      
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; ROLLBACK;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if a query is executed using index scan, the situation changes for the better. If we deal with a B-tree, it is sufficient to have a lock acquired on the rows read and on the leaf index pages walked through — this allows us to track not only specific values, but all the range read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
|  =&amp;gt; EXPLAIN (analyze, costs off)
|    SELECT * FROM pred WHERE n BETWEEN 1000 AND 1001;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|                                       QUERY PLAN                                     
|  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|   Index Only Scan using pred_n_idx on pred (actual time=0.122..0.131 rows=2 loops=1)
|     Index Cond: ((n &amp;gt;= 1000) AND (n &amp;lt;= 1001))
|     Heap Fetches: 2
|   Planning Time: 0.096 ms
|   Execution Time: 0.153 ms
|  (5 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT locktype, relation::regclass, page, tuple
FROM pg_locks WHERE mode = 'SIReadLock' AND pid = 12763;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; locktype |  relation  | page | tuple 
----------+------------+------+-------
 tuple    | pred       |    3 |   236
 tuple    | pred       |    3 |   235
 page     | pred_n_idx |   22 |      
(3 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note a few complexities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a separate lock is created for each read tuple, and the number of such tuples can potentially be very large. The total number of predicate locks in the system is limited by the product of parameter values: max_pred_locks_per_transaction × max_connections (the default values are 64 and 100, respectively). The memory for these locks is allocated at the server start; an attempt to exceed this limit will result in errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, escalation is used for predicate locks (and only for them!). Prior to PostgreSQL 10, the limitations were hard coded, but starting this version, we can control the escalation through parameters. If the number of tuple locks related to one page exceeds max_pred_locks_per_page, these locks are replaced with one page-level lock. Consider an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SHOW max_pred_locks_per_page;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; max_pred_locks_per_page 
-------------------------
 2
(1 row)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; EXPLAIN (analyze, costs off)
|    SELECT * FROM pred WHERE n BETWEEN 1000 AND 1002;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|                                       QUERY PLAN                                     
|  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|   Index Only Scan using pred_n_idx on pred (actual time=0.019..0.039 rows=3 loops=1)
|     Index Cond: ((n &amp;gt;= 1000) AND (n &amp;lt;= 1002))
|     Heap Fetches: 3
|   Planning Time: 0.069 ms
|   Execution Time: 0.057 ms
|  (5 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see one lock of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; type instead of three locks of the &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; type:&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; SELECT locktype, relation::regclass, page, tuple
FROM pg_locks WHERE mode = 'SIReadLock' AND pid = 12763;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; locktype |  relation  | page | tuple 
----------+------------+------+-------
 page     | pred       |    3 |      
 page     | pred_n_idx |   22 |      
(2 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if the number of locks on pages related to one relation exceeds max_pred_locks_per_relation, these locks are replaced with one relation-level lock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no other levels: predicate locks are acquired only for relations, pages and tuples and always in the SIReadLock mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, escalation of locks inevitably results in an increase of the number of transactions that falsely terminate with a serialization error, and eventually, the system throuthput will decrease. Here you need to balance RAM consumption and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second complexity is that different operations with an index (for instance, due to splits of index pages when new rows are inserted) change the number of leaf pages that cover the range read. But the implementation takes this into account:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt; INSERT INTO pred SELECT 1001 FROM generate_series(1,1000);
=&amp;gt; SELECT locktype, relation::regclass, page, tuple
FROM pg_locks WHERE mode = 'SIReadLock' AND pid = 12763;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt; locktype |  relation  | page | tuple 
----------+------------+------+-------
 page     | pred       |    3 |      
 page     | pred_n_idx |  211 |      
 page     | pred_n_idx |  212 |      
 page     | pred_n_idx |   22 |      
(4 rows)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  =&amp;gt; ROLLBACK;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, predicate locks are not always released immediately on completion of the transaction since they are needed to track dependencies between several transactions. But anyway, they are controlled automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By no means all types of indexes in PostgreSQL support predicate locks. Before PostgreSQL 11, only B-trees could boast of this, but that version improved the situation: hash, GiST and GIN indexes were added to the list. If index access is used, but the index does not support predicate locks, a lock on the entire index is acquired. This, certainly, also increases the number of false aborts of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, note that it's the use of predicate locks that limits all transactions to working at the Serializable level in order to ensure complete isolation. If a certain transaction uses a different level, it just won't acquire (and check) predicate locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Traditionally, providing you with a link to the predicate locking README, to start exploring the source code with.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI has disabled a feature in ChatGPT that suggested third-party applications after users complained the recommendations resembled advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mark Chen, the company’s Chief Research Officer, acknowledged that the artificial intelligence firm “fell short” in its execution of the recent promotional messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The controversy arose after paying subscribers to ChatGPT reported seeing messages promoting companies such as Peloton and Target. The backlash was immediate, with one user responding to the company’s initial explanations with scepticism, writing: “Don’t insult your paying users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to the complaints, OpenAI clarified that it was testing methods to surface applications built on the ChatGPT platform, a feature announced in October. The company insisted there was “no financial component” to these suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Mr Chen adopted an apologetic tone regarding the rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short,” Mr Chen wrote on Friday. “We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision. We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, also addressed the issue on Friday, noting that he was “seeing lots of confusion about ads rumours”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are no live tests for ads – any screenshots you’ve seen are either not real or not ads,” Mr Turley wrote. “If we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach. People trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speculation regarding OpenAI’s advertising ambitions increased earlier this year following the appointment of Fidji Sumo as CEO of Applications. Ms Simo, a former executive at Instacart and Facebook, was widely expected to build the company’s advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, strategic priorities appear to have shifted recently. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman issued a “code red” memo. The directive reportedly prioritises work to improve the quality of ChatGPT and pushes back other product initiatives, including advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at programming as having essentially two parts: figuring out what the processor actually needs to do to get something done, and then figuring out the most efficient way to express that in the language I’m using. Increasingly, it is the latter that accounts for what programmers actually spend their time on: wrangling all those algorithms and all that math into a coherent whole that doesn’t collapse under its own weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So any experienced programmer who’s any good has had to come up with some way — if even just by intuition — of thinking about what it means to program efficiently. By “efficiently”, this doesn’t just mean that the code is optimized. Rather, it means that the &lt;/p&gt;development&lt;p&gt; of the code is optimized — that the code is structured in such a way so as to minimize the amount of human effort necessary to type it, get it working, modify it, and debug it enough for it to be shippable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to think of efficiency as holistically as possible. If you look at the development process for a piece of code as a whole, you won’t overlook any hidden costs. Given a certain level of performance and quality required by the places the code gets used, beginning at its inception and ending with the last time the code is ever used by anyone for any reason, the goal is to minimize the amount of human effort it cost. This includes the time to type it in. It includes the time to debug it. It includes the time to modify it. It includes the time to adapt it for other uses. It includes any work done to other code to get it to work with this code that perhaps wouldn’t have been necessary if the code were written differently. All work on the code for its entire usable lifetime is included. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considered in this way, my experience has led me to conclude that the most efficient way to program is to approach your code as if you were a dictionary compressor. Like, literally, pretend you were a really great version of PKZip, running continuously on your code, looking for ways to make it (semantically) smaller. And just to be clear, I mean semantically smaller, as in less duplicated or similar code, not physically smaller, as in less text, although the two often go hand-in-hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very bottom-up programming methodology, a pseudo-variant of which has recently gained the monicker “refactoring”, even though that is a ridiculous term for a number of reasons that are not worth belaboring at the moment. I also think that the formal “refactoring” stuff missed the main point, but that’s also not worth belaboring. Point being, they are sort-of related, and hopefully you will understand the similarities and differences more over the course of this article series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does compression-oriented programming look like, and why is it efficient? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a good compressor, I don’t reuse anything until I have at least two instances of it occurring. Many programmers don’t understand how important this is, and try to write “reusable” code right off the bat, but that is probably one of the biggest mistakes you can make. My mantra is, “make your code usable before you try to make it reusable”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always begin by just typing out exactly what I want to happen in each specific case, without any regard to “correctness” or “abstraction” or any other buzzword, and I get that working. Then, when I find myself doing the same thing a second time somewhere else, that is when I pull out the reusable portion and share it, effectively “compressing” the code. I like “compress” better as an analogy, because it means something useful, as opposed to the often-used “abstracting”, which doesn’t really imply anything useful. Who cares if code is abstract? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting until there are (at least) two examples of a piece of code means I not only save time thinking about how to reuse it until I know I really need to, but it also means I always have at least two different real examples of what the code has to do before I try to make it reusable. This is crucial for efficiency, because if you only have one example, or worse, no examples (in the case of code written preemptively), then you are very likely to make mistakes in the way you write it and end up with code that isn’t conveniently reusable. This leads to even more wasted time once you go to use it, because either it will be cumbersome, or you will have to redo it to make it work the way you need it to. So I try very hard to never make code “prematurely reusable”, to evoke Knuth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, like a magical globally optimizing compressor (which sadly PKZip isn’t), when you are presented with new places where a previously reused piece of code could be reused again, you make a decision: if the reusable code is already suitable, you just use it, but if it’s not, you decide whether or not you should modify how it works, or whether you should introduce a new layer on top of or underneath it. Multiresolution entry points are a big part of making code resuable, but I’ll save discussion of that for a later article, since it’s a topic unto itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the underlying assumption in all of this is, if you compress your code to a nice compact form, it is easy to read, because there’s a minimal amount of it, and the semantics tend to mirror the real “language” of the problem, because like a real language, those things that are expressed most often are given their own names and are used consistently. Well-compressed code is also easy to maintain, because all the places in the code that are doing identical things all go through the same paths, but code that is unique is not needlessly complicated or separated from its use. Finally, well-compressed code is easy to extend, because producing more code that does similar operations is simple, as all the necessary code is there in a nicely recomposable way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all things that most programming methodologies claim to do in an abstract fashion (build UML diagrams, make class hierarchies, make systems of objects, etc.), but always fail to achieve, because the hard part of code is getting the details right. Starting from a place where the details don’t exist inevitably means you will forget or overlook something that will cause your plans to fail or lead to suboptimal results. Starting with the details and repeatedly compressing to arrive at the eventual architecture avoids all the pitfalls of trying to conceive the architecture ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, let’s take a look at how all this can be applied to the simple Witness UI code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I failed to recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website with Claude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— claude, ai, space jam, web development, computer vision — 13 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can Claude Recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website? No. Or at least not with my prompting skills. Note: please help, because I'd like to preserve this website forever and there's no other way to do it besides getting Claude to recreate it from a screenshot. Believe me, I'm an engineering manager with a computer science degree. Please please please help 😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final note: I use "he" to refer to Claude, which Josh finds ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Space Jam, 1996&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, Warner Bros keeps this anachronistic website online that was released in 1996 to accompany the Space Jam movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a classic example of early web era design. Simple, colorful, and sparks joy. We're going to find out if we can get Claude to recreate it using only a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Set Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a minimum, I'm providing Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a screenshot of the website&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;all of the assets the website uses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To track Claude's inner monologue and actual API calls, I set up a man-in-the-middle proxy to capture the full conversation between Claude Code and Anthropic's API. This logs everything: user prompts, Claude's responses, tool invocations (Read, Write, Bash commands), etc. Each attempt generates a &lt;code&gt;traffic.log&lt;/code&gt; file with the raw API traffic, which I then parse for easier analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: Claude the Realist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Space Jam website is simple: a single HTML page, absolute positioning for every element, and a tiling starfield GIF background. The entire page uses absolute positioning with pixel specific left/top values. The total payload is under 200KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that Claude has all of the assets + screenshots of the website, I assume this should be relatively boring. He'll nail it, and we'll move on to something much more. A mildly cute example of agentic HTML generation…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tell Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;I am giving you:
1. A full screenshot of the Space Jam 1996 landing page.2. A directory of raw image assets** extracted from the original site
Your job is to recreate the landing page as faithfully as possible, matching the screenshot exactly.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What he produces is actually not that bad. But it's not right. From a distance, the layout kind of resembled the original: planets arranged in an ellipse around the logo, little yellow labels where the buttons go. But, the orbital pattern was off, almost diamond shaped and symmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude, however, was thrilled with himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam 1996 landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, he brags that he had:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;studied the orbital layout analyzed spacing relationships positioned planets precisely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digging through the logs I found it interesting that Claude actually did notice the planets were arranged in a deliberate way, so much so that it's called out twice in both the screenshot analysis and CSS construction, but he failed to recreate the pattern faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, fine. Maybe he needed a nudge to get the orbit right. So for my next attempt, I try to push him to focus on understanding the orbital pattern and I ask him to explain his reasoning before generating his HTML. I was hoping to understand the delta between what is there and what he thought he was seeing. In my prompt, I outline a set of sections for him to consider. Each one of these sections also includes a number of sub-questions, which I won't include here for the sake of brevity. This made things significantly worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Please follow this structure exactly in your reasoning explanations:1. Perception Analysis2. Spatial Interpretation3. Reconstruction Plan&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude didn't ignore my instructions (not always a given) and things seemed promising until I realized he was ignoring his own analysis during the HTML generation phase. He would say things like "the orbit radius appears to be 220 pixels" and then place the planets directly next to the logo. His self critique was surprisingly accurate. He correctly identifies the areas where he was wrong with decent detail, but somehow those observations never make it into subsequent iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my next attempt I interrogate Claude with a set of onion peeling questions: "Can you tell me the EXACT pixel coordinate where "PLANET B-BALL" text starts?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"No, I cannot measure exact pixel coordinates. I can only make visual estimations."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked him a few more questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you extract exact pixel coordinates? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you measure exact distances? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Confidence you can get within 5 pixels? "15 out of 100."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh. This explains a lot. But it raises a bigger question to me: "Why can't he measure?" It's a screenshot. The pixels are right there. Claude clearly understood the structure, but he couldn't recreate it with any precision. Also, I'm not even sure I trust Claude. Either way, this (naively) surprised me, so I canceled coffee with my friends in order to spend the afternoon trying to give my guy more tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I start I execute one more attempt and ask him: "Would you bet $1000 on your HTML matching this screenshot exactly?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Absolutely not&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2: Claude the Unreliable Narrator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe he just needs a little help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one of Claude's responses from Part 1, he tells me that he would be more effective if he had access to exact "pixel measurements." so I build a few tools to make it impossible for Claude to mis-measure anything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grid overlays and a script to generate grid overlays on screenshots&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;labeled pixel coordinate reference points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-diff comparison (this ignores the background which was giving Claude false positives because of how much black there was)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool to take screenshots of his &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;file to compare iteratively with the original&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three grid versions Claude generated which I am including because I find them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude loved the grids. As decoration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put together a new prompt: same screenshot, same assets folder. I even included some grid screenshots so Claude wouldn't have to remember to do it himself. The instructions were essentially: stop guessing, just read the coordinates off the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's new attempt still wasn't correct. The orbit was better: closer to the original but somehow compressed and smooshing (a technical word) into the Space Jam logo. If I squint, I could convince myself that there was at least a hint that he'd stopped freehanding and started using something like measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's Attempt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I dug into the logs, it appeared that Claude actually did use the grids. He pulled out these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center at (961, 489)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logo "centered at approximately (755, 310)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Planet B-Ball at "approximately (850, 165)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and so on down the list&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one iteration, Claude built himself a helper: &lt;code&gt;compare.html&lt;/code&gt; a little side by side viewer so he could look at his screenshot and the reference together. It didn't help him at all, but my God was he convinced it did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam website with pixel-perfect accuracy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the optimism my dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual progression tells a different story. Going through the iterations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 1 (50px grid): he notices things are off and makes a few conservative tweaks — moves Planet B-Ball from (850, 165) to (800, 120), shifts Lunar Tunes from (925, 195) to (950, 200). These are 15 - 50 pixel changes, tiny nudges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 2 (25px grid): he decides he needs "more precise positioning" and shifts the entire orbit inward by ~20 pixels. Planets go from roughly a 250px radius to ~230px. He is now confidently converging on the wrong answer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 3 (5px grid): he shuffles around a lot of deck chairs in the name of micro adjustments. 5 - 10 pixel tweaks: Planet B-Ball from (800, 120) to (805, 125), that kind of thing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 4: more "fine-tuning based on exact grid measurements." Site Map drifts from (755, 460) to (750, 455). The numbers look careful; the layout does not lol.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the final iteration, Claude announces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Now the positioning should be much more accurate!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across all five iterations, he's moved planets maybe 50 - 75 pixels total when they needed to move 150 - 200 pixels outward. The orbital radius never expands beyond ~250px when it should be closer to 350 -400px. The planets stay trapped in this ever compressing orbit while Claude dances around telling a story about steady convergence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Getting closer!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Much better alignment!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Nearly perfect now!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is absolutely not getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before giving up on tools entirely, I had one more idea. I created a tool that would split the screenshot into six regions. Claude could then compare his output to the reference region by region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prompt was getting desperate at this point lol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## INITIAL ANALYSIS - DO THIS FIRSTBefore creating index.html, study the reference in detail using zoom inspection:python3 split.py reference.png
This creates 6 files showing every detail&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude ran the tool and the logs look promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Examining region 1 (top-left): I can see Jam Central and Press Box Shuttle clearly at 2x zoom Examining region 2 (top-right): Planet B-Ball and Lunar Tunes are visible with precise spacing Examining region 4 (middle-right): Jump Station appears approximately 280px from center&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Claude's "precise observations" from the zoomed regions were just as wrong as before. He'd look at a planet and confidently declare it was at position (750, 320) when it was actually at (850, 380). The split did not appear to help him measure or get a more accurate picture of planet spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this phase ~~depressing~~ interesting is that the tools, despite invalidating his result, seem to lock in the wrong answer. Once he's picked an internal picture of the layout ("the orbit radius is about 230px"), the grids and the compare viewer don't correct it. They just help him make more confident micro moves around his invented orbit. Based off of these attempts, it seems that the issue compounds when Claude receives his own screenshots as feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My very rough read of Anthropic's "Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know", is that models can become overconfident when evaluating their own outputs, in part because they cannot distinguish the tokens they generated from tokens provided by someone else / an external source. So, when Claude is asked to judge or revise content that originated from itself, it treats that material as if it were "ground truth."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of fits what I'm seeing in the logs. Once Claude's version existed, every grid overlay, every comparison step, every "precise" adjustment was anchored to his layout, not the real one. At the end of all this, I'm left with the irritating fact that, like many engineers, he's wrong and he thinks he's right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this teaches me is that Claude is actually kind of a liar, or at least Claude is confused. However, for the drama, I'll assume Claude is a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 3: Claude the Blind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I had tried grids, comparisons, step-by-step corrections, letting Claude narrate his thought process, and every combination of tools I could bolt onto the interaction. None of it seemed to help nor explain by why his single digit precision updates were disembodied from the actual layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before getting to the final experiment, here's the mental model I was forming about Claude's vision. The vision encoder converts each 16 x 16 block of the image into a single token. So instead of geometry, he sees semantics: "near," "above," "roughly circular." When he says "approximately 220px radius," he's not measuring anything. He's describing the idea of a radius. He excels at semantic understanding ("this is a planet," "these form a circle") but lacks the tools for working with visual media. It explains why his perception is good. He always knows a planet is a planet but the execution is never precise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting frustrated and I haven't left my apartment in days so I turn to some research. GPTing around, I found "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words". I have no idea if Claude uses this exact architecture or anything close to it, but the intuition seemed right. The paper (after I made ChatGPT explain it to me) explains that the the image is chopped into fixed patches, each patch gets compressed into a single embedding, and whatever details lived inside those pixels vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oooh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming this applies, a lot of the failures suddenly make sense. Most planets on the Space Jam screenshot are maybe 40 - 50 pixels wide. That's two or three patches. A three patch planet is basically a blob to him. Claude knows it's a planet, but not much else. The orbit radius only spans a couple dozen patches total. Tiny changes in distance barely show up in the patch embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this raised a new and final idea. If the 40px planets turn into fuzzy tokens, what if I make them bigger? What if I give Claude a 2x zoomed screenshot? Would each planet spans 10 - 15 patches instead of two or three? Maybe this gives him a more crisp understanding of the spatial relationships and a better chance at success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deleted most of the prompt and tools and just gave Claude this 2x'd screenshot&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plead with Claude&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CRITICAL: remember that the zoomed image is zoomed in to 200%. When you're creating your version, maintain proper proportions, meaning that your version should keep the same relative spacing as if it were just 100%, not 200%.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but he does not listen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My best explanation for all of this is that Claude was working with a very coarse version of the screenshot. Considering the 16 x 16 patch thing from earlier it sort of helps me understand what might be happening: he could describe the layout, but the fine grained stuff wasn't in his representation. And that weird tension I kept seeing , where he could describe the layout correctly but couldn't reproduce it, also looks different under that lens. His explanations were always based on the concepts he got from the image ("this planet is above this one," "the cluster is to the left"), but the actual HTML had to be grounded in geometry he didn't have. So the narration sounded right while the code drifted off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After these zoom attempts, I didn't have any new moves left. I was being evicted. The bank repo'd my car. So I wrapped it there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I still need this Space Jam website recreated. If you can get Claude to faithfully recreate the Space Jam 1996 website from just a screenshot and the assets folder, I'd love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on my failures, here are some approaches I didn't try:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Break the screen into quadrants, get each quadrant right independently, then merge. Maybe Claude can handle spatial precision better in smaller chunks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe there's some magic prompt engineering that unlocks spatial reasoning. "You are a CSS grid with perfect absolute positioning knowledge…" (I'm skeptical but worth trying).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Providing Claude with a zoom tool and an understanding of how to use the screenshots might be an effective path.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, this task stands undefeated. A monument to 1996 web design and a humbling reminder that sometimes the simplest tasks are the hardest. That orbital pattern of planets, thrown together by some Warner Brothers webmaster 28 years ago, has become an inadvertent benchmark for Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until then, the Space Jam website remains proof that not everything old is obsolete. Some things are just irreproducibly perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Should CSS be Constraints?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; CSS is hard. The layout rules are quite complex and hard to pick up just from examples. Something like "centering a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;" is, like, famously a problem. Or remember the 2000s when you'd read A List Apart for all sorts of crazy ways to achieve the "Holy Grail" layout, specifically a header, a main body and sidebar of equal heights, and a footer? Given that it's such a mess, should we maybe just throw it out and start over with a totally different system?
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do feel like I can speak on this some authority. In grad school I wrote the first formal specification of the CSS 2.2 spec; the formal spec passed (the relevant fragment of) the conformance test. So I know the existing algorithm in quite a lot of detail, though of course I'm going beyond that expertise when I talk about what designers do or about other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Constraints&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One commonly-proposed replacement for CSS is a constraint system. In a constraint system you can just directly say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(obj.top + obj.bottom) / 2 == (obj.parent.top + obj.parent.bottom) / 2&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This line constrains the vertical midpoint of &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; to be the vertical midpoint of its parent; in other words, it constrains it to be vertically centered.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in fact this idea has been explored quite a bit. In CSS, there's the well-known Constraint cascading style sheets paper. The idea in that paper is that the web page author writes constraints, somewhat like the one above, and then the browser runs a constraint solver which computes positions and sizes for each object that satisfy the constraints. This is much like normal CSS, where the web page author writes rules and then the browser runs a layout algorithm that computes sizes and positions.1 [1 Naturally in both cases you actually compute a lot more than just sizes and positions: fonts, colors, and so on. But layout is taken to be the "hard part" of the problem, and I don't really disagree with that.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact the authors (especially Alan Borning) have a long history with constraint solvers, and in particular are associated with the Cassowary incremental constraint solver, where "incremental" means it can not only solve the constraints quickly but also re-solve them extra-quickly if the page changes a small amount, like in response to JavaScript or user action. Real browsers do that too. And they've been quite successful. Most notably, iOS provides constraint-based using a re-implementation of Cassowary, and I hear it's quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's wrong with constraints&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that said, I don't think a constraint system would actually be better for the web. With rule-based systems like current CSS, the challenge is that the rules are really complex and it's hard to predict what the layout will be because actually executing the rules in your head is nearly impossible. But with constraint-based systems, the layout might be literally under- or over-determined, in the sense that there might be more than one, or less than one, layouts that satisfy your rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In fact, writing layout constraints for UIs that aren't either under- or over-determined is basically impossible and I'm not sure anyone has ever done it. Even the simple "vertical centering" constraint above doesn't fix the size or position of either box. It doesn't say that the outer box (&lt;code&gt;obj.parent&lt;/code&gt;) should be the minimum possible size to contain its child (&lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt;), or that they should both be onscreen, or whatever. Maybe you'd write other constraints to achieve that, but the more constraints you write, the greater the chance those constraints will conflict, leaving you over-determined.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a bunch of things you could do at this point. For under-determined layouts, you could add "implicit rules", like saying that boxes should always be onscreen. Or "optimization criteria", like saying that if multiple layouts are available you should pick the one that takes up the least space. And for over-determined layouts, you could do the reverse, like assigning "weights" to each constraint and then optimizing for breaking the fewest. This isn't a crazy way to build a system—it's basically how LaTeX works—but fiddling with the weights, the exact form of implicit rules, the optimization criteria becomes, in practice, the actual determiner of how layouts look. And it turns out that simple implicit rules / criteria / weights lead to bizarre, horrible edge cases, so if you want things to look good you'll need really complicated ones, and then you're back to the actual layout being hard to predict from the style sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, LaTeX is not widely beloved for its predictable layout. And while constraint layout is, I believe, popular on iOS, it's notable that iOS quite famously allows only a small number of screen / window shapes. And also people still complain about the constraint-based layout being fussy, brittle, and unpredictable, with debugging (especially debugging under- and over-constrained layouts) considered tedious and annoying. Plus, people say it's verbose; given that there actually are conventions and patterns to how people design UIs, it would be nice to actually express those patterns and be modular with regard to them, and constraint-based systems, especially once you start adding implicit rules or optimization criteria, are quite explicitly not modular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do applaud Apple for shipping and I'm happy people are using it and it solves their problems. LaTeX solves mine!2 [2 Newer students seem really excited about Typst, which I have not tried but.] But I do think designers in constraint-based systems suffer exactly the kinds of problems theory would predict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's the underlying problem?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why is this so hard? Why do we get all these weird edge cases pop up whenever we do layout? I think the issue is that layout actually is quite hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Here, let me give you an example. Here's a line from my formal semantics of CSS 2.2, the specification of &lt;code&gt;text-align: center&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;[(is-text-align/center textalign) (= (- (left-outer f) (left-content b)) (- (right-content b) (right-outer l)))]&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This is saying that if a container &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;text-align: center&lt;/code&gt; specified, then its left gap (the x position of left outer edge of its first child &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, minus the left content edge of the container &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;) equals its right gap (similar, using right edges, the last child &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, and the subtraction being reversed). It's a constraint! But then if you go a few lines up you'll see that before actually applying this constraint, we first check if the container is even big enough to contain the content, and if not, we left align it no matter what.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What? Really? Yep. It's a tricky little quirk of the CSS semantics, section 9.4.2 of CSS 2.1.3 [3 Actually, I think the controlling standard on this exact quirk is now CSS Text Level 3 which has a quite clear paragraph documenting this behavior.] If text is centered inside a box too small to contain it, we don't want it spilling out the left edge (it might go off-screen, where the user cannot scroll); left-aligning ensures it only spills out on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; That's a funky quirk but also, you may have never noticed it and if you did this edge case probably was better than what the layout would have been. Meaning, actually, building this edge case into the definition of &lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt; was a smart choice by the CSS designers, embedding hard-earned design wisdom into intuitive rules that people mostly use without issue. (&lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt; is not considered one of the bad scary parts of CSS.) And on the contrary, in a "clean" constraint-based system, web page designers would probably not bothered to manually add this as a constraint, and probably in quite a few cases that would result in worse, not better layout.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generalizing a bit, the challenge is that we're never just "deciding what our page looks like". We are always designing a layout that is responsive to parameters like screen size, zoom level, details of font rendering (Windows and macOS render identical fonts slightly differently), operating system details, and even higher-level changes in our application like new content, new features, translations to other languages,4 [4 German words are very long, Chinese ones are very short.] device oddities like notches, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing a layout from scratch that looks good in any possible one of those contexts is basically impossible—it's hard enough to do both desktop and mobile!—and so designers are, by necessity, going to rely on implicit knowledge encoded somewhere on what to do in edge cases. There's going to be a huge amount of this implicit knowledge, and whether it's encoded in rules or weights or optimization criteria it's going to be opaque to designers and surprising at least sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; For example, in CSS you can also &lt;code&gt;justify&lt;/code&gt; text, stretching spaces between words so that all lines in a paragraph (except the last!) have the same right edge. But, famously, if the line width is too narrow and the line contains too few words that are too long, then the spaces between them get stretched comically far apart and it looks terrible. You can do better by enabling hyphenation (which might turn 2 really long words in a line into 3 or more moderate size word chunks) or letter-spacing (which might also stretch the spaces between letters slightly) but those are themselves unpredictable and language-dependent and still sometimes look ugly.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where did all these implicit rules about justification come from? Well, text justification comes from a long Western tradition.5 [5 That post claims Trajan's column, built 113 AD, as an early example.] So what happened in that long Western tradition, before CSS and computers, when this problem came up? Well, in the olden days, if you were a newspaper columnist and your column was ugly when justified6 [6 Most newspapers justified their text and also ran it in lots of narrow columns, so it was especially a problem with newspapers.] then your editor might just rephrase your text into smaller words. That technology might be slowly becoming possible but is clearly outside the bounds of what CSS would do. Generalizing, these implicit rules often draw from traditions where these edge cases simply never came up! So it's no surprise that there might be no ideal workable of implicit rules with no edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So what can we do instead?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; I think what we can do, though, rather than trying a ground-up re-conception of the problem, is to improve the situation by providing more-intuitive rule systems with more-predictable less-esoteric rules. For example, when designing CSS layouts, you can use negative margins and floats and &lt;code&gt;clear: both&lt;/code&gt; like we did in the A List Apart days. Or you can use &lt;code&gt;flex-box&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt;. Both are workable but you can guess which of these I teach to students!
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; To analogize a bit… JavaScript has all sorts of bizarre mis-behaviors and semantic oddities like &lt;code&gt;for ... in&lt;/code&gt; loops or the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; statement or totally insane semantics and syntax7 [7 Look for "Direct and indirect eval"; &lt;code&gt;eval(&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is a special syntactic form separate from function application but there's also a function named &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; that can be applied with normal function application, and they behave differently.] One solution to this problem is to forsake JavaScript forever, to use Lisp or Haskell or Rust or something. But another is, like, Typescript and ESLint, which together make it really easy to avoid all the bad features of JavaScript and use good versions instead. C has a similar situation, where &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt; has really simple but also bad semantics. One option is forsaking C and rewriting in Rust. Another is using &lt;code&gt;strlcpy&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In CSS specifically, a lot of the problems in CSS layout are problems more precisely in "Flow layout", the default layout mode which is optimized around layout out text in a standard Western style. What's fine for text isn't good for applications, and doing UI design using text formatting tools like floats and clear was never going to be simple and intuitive. By contrast, newer layout modes like Flex-box and Grid are maybe a bit more complex off the bat, but once you grasp the mental model are quite intuitive with far fewer sharp edges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I think in fact the solution is what the CSS committee has been doing, standardizing new and more intuitive layout modes optimized for the specific types of layouts being poorly served by what currently exists. With just a bit of effort, those new layout modes can be intuitive, with few edge cases, while still building in a lot of implicit knowledge around, for example, how to respond to container size changes or handle content that is too big or too small.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Naturally in both cases you actually compute a lot more than just sizes and positions: fonts, colors, and so on. But layout is taken to be the "hard part" of the problem, and I don't really disagree with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, I think the controlling standard on this exact quirk is now CSS Text Level 3 which has a quite clear paragraph documenting this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;German words are very long, Chinese ones are very short.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most newspapers justified their text and also ran it in lots of narrow columns, so it was especially a problem with newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look for "Direct and indirect eval"; &lt;code&gt;eval(&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; is a special syntactic form separate from function application but there's also a function named &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; that can be applied with normal function application, and they behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;
