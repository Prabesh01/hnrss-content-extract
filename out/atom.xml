  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if your car worked like so many apps? You’re driving somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the road and asks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How are you enjoying your drive so far?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minute later it does it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It blocks your speedometer with an overlay tutorial about the turn signal. It highlights the wiper controls and refuses to go away until you demonstrate mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ridiculous, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, this is how a lot of modern software behaves. Not because it’s broken, but because we’ve normalized an interruption model that would be unacceptable almost anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve started to think of this as backseat software: the slow shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel that operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it’s remarkably hard to keep it quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is about how we got here. Not overnight, but slowly. One reasonable step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software Came on Disks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a time when software shipped on physical media: floppy disks, CD-ROMs, sometimes even with a spiral-bound manual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software felt like a product back then. You bought it, installed it, and used it. If you upgraded, it was because you chose to. The software didn’t constantly change underneath you, and it didn’t have the opportunity to ask for your attention beyond whatever UI the developers shipped on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That era had real downsides. If you shipped a serious bug, you lived with it until the next release, which could be weeks or months away. If security issues were discovered, your options ranged from “mail a patch” to “good luck.” In hindsight, it’s amazing we survived!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But something else was true too. When you were using the software, you were alone with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a software developer, if something was wrong, you found out because users told you. Sometimes loudly. Sometimes angrily. Often on message forums or during support calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feedback was slower and scarcer, but it was real. It was also “expensive” in the way that matters. You had to earn it, listen to it, and interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Always Online&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the internet arrived, and for a while it was almost entirely upside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software could finally be updated after it shipped. Bugs could be fixed. Security holes could be closed. Documentation got easier. Support got easier. The idea of “ship it and hope for the best” started to fade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s update infrastructure is a good example of the era. Updates moved from “go download this” toward automation over time, and by the early 2000s the industry was normalizing the idea that your machine could check for and apply updates regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a genuine leap forward in quality and safety. If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a serious bug report, you know how valuable it is to fix something now rather than in the next boxed release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Back Channel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once software could reliably connect to the internet, it no longer just received instructions. It could talk back to the company that made it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, this too was mostly good. Crash reports made it easier to fix real problems, update checks were convenient, and license activation reduced some kinds of piracy. Teams could finally see patterns in failure modes instead of guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers like me love this kind of feedback loop, and for good reason. A tool that improves over time is better than one that doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that back channel didn’t stay limited to “this crashed” and “there’s an update.” It expanded, quietly, because once you can send some data home, the next question arrives right on schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Since we’re already connected…what else can we learn?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everything Gets Measured&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once software could send data home, the next natural thought was:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Can we understand how people actually use this?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, that’s not an evil thought. In fact, it’s useful! Before analytics, if you wanted to understand user behavior, you had to ask people, watch them, or infer patterns from support tickets. That requires time, empathy, and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, you didn’t have to guess anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Web analytics going mainstream is one of those quiet accelerants. Google’s acquisition of Urchin in 2005, and the rise of Google Analytics shortly after, helped normalize the idea that instrumentation and dashboards were simply part of building software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of arguing in a meeting about which features mattered most, you could look at usage data. Instead of guessing where people struggled, you could see drop-offs. Instead of relying on the loudest customer, you could get a broader view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But somewhere along the way, the center of gravity shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage data stopped being a tool for improving software and became a tool for optimizing behavior. The question quietly changed from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Is this good software?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Does this increase engagement?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s when the vocabulary starts to creep in. DAU. MAU. Retention. Funnels. Stickiness. Cohorts. Conversion. Gamification. Oh my!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked inside a modern product organization, you’ve heard these words so often they start to feel unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Metrics Can Be Correct and Still Be Wrong&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most dangerous things about analytics is that they feel objective. A chart is a chart. A number is a number. They have the aesthetic of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked this quote by William Bruce Cameron (often misattributed to Albert Einstein):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metrics don’t measure reality. They measure what your product currently makes easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a well-known warning about this, often summarized as: when a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure. It’s commonly referred to as Goodhart’s Law, and the broader point shows up in multiple fields, because it keeps happening to humans in systems with incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was at Microsoft, a team wanted to remove a feature because “the analytics show that nobody uses it.” If you looked at the UI, though, that feature had been moved deeper and deeper over time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it used to be easy to find&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then it moved into a menu&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then into a submenu&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then into a settings panel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then behind an “advanced” section&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;then it was basically invisible&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course nobody used it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analytics didn’t prove the feature was unwanted. The analytics proved that we buried it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even worse, once a metric becomes a target, people get promoted for moving it. That doesn’t require anyone to be malicious. It just requires incentives and a dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimenting in Production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measuring behavior changes what feels possible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What if we try two versions to see which one performs better?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where A/B testing enters the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On paper, it’s an engineering triumph! Instead of arguing about opinions, you can test ideas. Instead of debating copy or layout in a meeting, you can ship both and let real-world behavior decide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But A/B testing quietly changes the role of the product team. You’re no longer just building a tool and observing how it’s used. You’re now running experiments on people…adjusting wording, placement, timing, friction, and flow to see what moves the metric.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, the product stops being a finished artifact and starts behaving like a laboratory. Every screen becomes provisional, and every interaction becomes a hypothesis. Once that mindset takes hold, it’s very hard not to optimize for what moves fastest, even if it moves the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a quieter consequence here that doesn’t get talked about much. When experimentation becomes the primary decision-making tool, a strong product vision becomes optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not because anyone argues against vision, but because you don’t strictly need it anymore, and because backing a chart is safer than backing an opinion. Metrics have numbers and experiments have winners. If a decision goes wrong, you can always point to the data and say, “we followed the evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, this can change the role of a product team where judgment slowly gives way to iteration, and taste gives way to performance. The product still evolves, but it does so without a clear sense of direction…only a sense of momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Guidance Everywhere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once experimentation becomes the default way decisions get made, changing behavior stops being theoretical and starts being procedural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, nudges aren’t a new idea. They’re the obvious next move. It usually starts reasonably:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We shipped a feature. Users might not notice it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you add a little callout. Then a tooltip. Then an onboarding tour. Then a “What’s New” screen. Then a little survey. Then another survey, because you didn’t get enough responses the first time. By the time you’re done dismissing everything, the tool has already taken more time than the task itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever read about “choice architecture” and nudging, this will feel familiar. The modern language for it was popularized in the late 2000s, and the core idea is simple: how choices are presented changes what people do, even if nothing is technically forced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then product teams go one step further. Instead of just shaping choices, you can shape timing. Prompts start showing up in the middle of workflows because that’s when the user is “most engaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry also has a whole discipline around persuasive design and how to move someone from intention to action with prompts, friction removal, and well-timed triggers. B.J. Fogg’s behavior model is one of the more cited frameworks in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some nudges are genuinely helpful. But the same machinery that helps you discover a feature can also be used to push you into something you didn’t come here to do. And once the machinery exists, it gets reused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also why coming back to an app after you’ve been away for as little as a week can feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Not because you forgot how to use the tool, but because the tool has been busy while you were gone. There’s new tips, new tours, new “what’s new” overlays, new announcements, new prompts that all want a click before you’re allowed to do the thing you actually opened it for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Push Notifications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the smartphone era arrived and made interruption cheaper. Once you can send push notifications, you no longer have to wait for the user to open the tool. You can tap them on the shoulder whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s push notification service arrived with iOS 3.0 in 2009, and it’s hard to overstate what a shift this was for the “who initiates the interaction?” question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of this is legitimate and genuinely helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;messages you asked for&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;alerts you configured&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reminders you chose&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we all know where it went:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“We miss you.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“You haven’t finished setup.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“You haven’t tried this feature.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Come back and see what’s new.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All framed as helpful. All measured in engagement. And just like that, the tool starts acting less like a tool and more like a stalker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In Defense&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, not every prompt is evil, and not every notification is marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some software is genuinely complicated, and a little guidance prevents real mistakes. Some categories are basically made of alerts: messaging, security, banking, calendars, delivery tracking, anything where timing actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Telemetry exists because some problems can’t be found any other way. It’s often the only method that enables teams to find the weird crashes that happen on one driver version, one device model, or one edge case you’ll never reproduce in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even the “feature tour” has a defensible origin story. Users ask for improvements, teams ship them, and then users complain they didn’t know the improvements existed. In other words, the same people who hate popups also punish you when you make changes silently. If you’ve ever shipped a big UI redesign, you already know this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the problem isn’t that software ever teaches, asks, or informs. The problem is that once a company builds the machinery to do it, that machinery becomes cheap to reuse, and the incentives gradually pull it away from “help the user succeed” toward “move the metric.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What starts as an occasional heads-up becomes a permanent layer of UI exhaust. What starts as support becomes a funnel. What starts as a reminder becomes a habit-forming system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the drift I’m talking about. Not guidance existing at all, but guidance becoming the default posture of the tool…always talking, always nudging, always taking the first turn in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And once the tool decides it should initiate the interaction, the rest of the story is mostly mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Even the Builders Hate It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most bizarre contradictions in modern software is that the people building these engagement systems don’t like them either!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask anyone who works on onboarding popups, feature tours, lifecycle messaging, or in-app announcements how they feel when an app interrupts them mid-flow to announce something they didn’t ask for. The answer is almost always the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They hate it! Or at least they’re annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find me the telemarketer who likes being called during their own dinner. The job exists because it works enough in aggregate, not because anyone enjoys being on either end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why does it keep happening? Because inside companies, the incentives are clear and the measurements are easy. You can measure clicks and track whether they led to a “completion.” You can measure whether a nudge led to the next step in the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You cannot easily measure the resentment. Or the rage clicks when they smash a button to dismiss another “did you know” pop-up. You cannot easily chart the moment a user thinks, “I used to like this product, and now it feels needy.” You cannot easily quantify the slow erosion of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an older framing for this that I like: in an information-rich world, attention becomes the scarce resource. Herbert Simon wrote about this dynamic in 1971, long before push notifications, app stores, or social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your business runs on attention, and attention is scarce, then the pressure to “capture” it becomes constant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tools Are Supposed to Get Out of the Way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the marketing adage goes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People don’t want a drill. They want a hole in the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drill is just the tool. The outcome is the job. Nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new drill today!” Well, except drill enthusiasts, I suppose. Likewise, nobody wakes up and says, “I’d like to buy a new app today!” In fact, your app is in the way of their objective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could argue that nobody wants the hole either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What they really want is what comes after the hole. They want to hang photos of family and friends, souvenirs from trips, and artwork that makes a room feel like home. The drill and the hole are both just steps along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That distance matters. The further a tool is from the real human outcome, the more invisible it should be. The drill doesn’t ask how you’re enjoying your experience drilling. It doesn’t upsell you on premium hole-making. It exists to disappear the moment it’s done its job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a useful way to think about software. Most users don’t want “software.” They want the outcome:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;write the document&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;edit the photo&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pay the invoice&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;file the taxes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ship the code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;communicate with the team&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great tools get out of the way so the user can accomplish their goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your favorite products feel like they’re not there. You open them, do the thing you came to do, and close them again without ever feeling managed, marketed to, or delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your least favorite products tend to do the opposite. You use them because you have to, not because you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everything Gets “Smart”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is spreading because “smart” is spreading. Smart TVs. Smart speakers. Smart thermostats. Smart appliances. Anything that joins your Wi-Fi can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;update itself (often good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;send diagnostics (often good)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;collect usage data (sometimes defensible)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;interrupt you (almost always annoying)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;market to you (almost never what you bought it for)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the same story as software, just with plastic and a power cord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more backchannel: some “smart” TVs use Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) to identify what’s on the screen and turn that into data. It’s basically a pixel-sampled fingerprint of anything that shows up on your screen whether streamed, broadcast, or just played back locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want a more academic version of how “data collection leads to prediction which leads to intervention” becomes a business model, this is adjacent to what Shoshana Zuboff describes as surveillance capitalism. It’s not just observing behavior, but intervening to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How We Got Here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these events ruined software by themselves. They just made the next step easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1990s: consumer internet connectivity becomes mainstream, and “online” stops being a special mode.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1996–1997: PointCast popularizes “push” to the desktop (including ads): software starts initiating the interaction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1997: pop-up ads arrive and interruption becomes a business model.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1997: Office 97 ships with “Clippy” the Office Assistant, the friendly ancestor of in-app nudges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2000: “automatic updates” becomes a normal expectation for consumer operating systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2005: Urchin → Google Analytics: instrumentation and dashboards go mainstream.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 10, 2008: the App Store launches and app distribution becomes frictionless.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;June 17, 2009: push notifications arrive at scale on iOS (even if they weren’t first): the app no longer has to wait for you to open it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nov 4, 2009: Apple announces 2 billion push notifications already delivered, early proof that “tap on the shoulder” scales.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2010s: “growth hacking” becomes a discipline; nudges, tours, overlays, and lifecycle messaging become standard product surface area.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By 2011, Apple’s review rules explicitly forbade using push for “advertising, promotions, or direct marketing.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mar 4, 2020: Apple changes course and allows marketing push, but only with explicit opt-in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2020s: “enshittification” becomes a word people recognize because enough people feel the pattern.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People use “enshittification” to describe platform decay. What I’m describing here is one of the mechanisms that makes that decay feel personal. It’s the constant conversion of your attention into a KPI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing for Quiet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go back to floppy disks. I like fast updates. I like security patches. I like sync. I like crash reports when they help fix real issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I want is for “phone home” to be treated like a privileged capability, not an assumed right. In other domains, we treat privileged capabilities with care. We put them behind intentional choices. We build guardrails. And we treat abuse as a bug, not a growth opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few practical ways out. And yes, we’ve heard many of these before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1) Make interruptions opt-in, and make opt-out permanent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to announce a feature, fine. Put it somewhere predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to educate, fine. Let me ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to survey me, fine. Ask at a sensible moment and accept “no” as a real answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, if I turn something off, it should stay off! A tool should not require me to keep saying “not now.” Or conveniently “forget” my choices in its next update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2) Separate product health telemetry from growth telemetry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crash reports, performance metrics, and error logs are about stability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engagement nudges are about behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When those get mixed together, the growth incentives win, because they produce the cleanest charts and the easiest wins. If you can’t draw a clear line between “this helps us fix bugs” and “this helps us juice numbers,” the product will drift toward the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3) Use analytics as a flashlight, not a steering wheel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analytics are useful for asking better questions. They are not answers by themselves. Before removing a feature because “nobody uses it,” ask:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it discoverable?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did we move it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did we rename it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it used rarely because it solves rare but important problems?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is it used by a small set of power users who keep the whole system running?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then talk to humans. Analytics can reduce guessing, but it can also create false certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4) Optimize for trust, not just return visits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-term engagement can be increased by annoyance. Long-term loyalty is harder and more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best products I use don’t constantly remind me to use them. They quietly do their job so well that I come back when I need them. That’s what tools are supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;5) Ship a real “quiet mode”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not “quiet except for what we care about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No popups. No tours. No surveys. No “news.” No nudges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the product is genuinely valuable, quiet mode should improve retention, because it respects the user’s attention and intent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, it’s a nice forcing function. If your product can’t stand on its own without constantly poking the user, that’s a signal. Maybe not the signal you want, but definitely a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software didn’t break all at once. It eroded slowly, one reasonable justification at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each step made sense in isolation, and each step could be defended. Together, they reshaped the priorities of an entire industry. Once software became measurable in this way, it became optimizable in this way. And optimization has a way of eating everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, let’s make software that respects your attention, does its job well, and lets you get on with your life. That’s what good software used to feel like and what it could feel like again. Good software is a tool that you operate, not a channel that operates on you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, I love hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze: SpaceX’s Space Situational Awareness System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX has developed a novel Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system, called Stargaze, that significantly enhances the safety and sustainability of satellite operations in low Earth orbit (LEO), and its screening data will be made available to the broader satellite operator community free of charge in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practices—such as leaving rocket bodies in LEO, operators maneuvering their satellites without sharing trajectory predictions or coordinating with other active satellites, and countries conducting anti-satellite tests—have heightened the risk of collision, necessitating improvements in space-traffic coordination. Conventional methods typically observe objects only a limited number of times per day, causing large uncertainties in orbital predictions, further compounded by volatile space weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze delivers a several-order-of-magnitude increase in detection capability compared to conventional ground-based systems. Stargaze uses data collected from nearly 30,000 star trackers, each of which makes continuous observations of nearby objects, resulting in approximately 30 million transits detected daily across the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system autonomously detects observations of orbiting objects and are then aggregated to generate accurate orbit estimates and predictions of position and velocity for all detected objects in near real-time. These predictions integrate into a space-traffic management platform that identifies potential close approaches between objects in space and generates Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs). To fully realize the utility of such frequent observations, SpaceX developed this system to provide conjunction screening results within minutes, compared to the current industry standard of several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To maximize safety for all satellites in space, SpaceX will be making Stargaze conjunction data available to all operators, free of charge, via its space-traffic management platform. This platform has been in a “closed beta” with over a dozen participating satellite operators, allowing low-latency ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening. Starting this spring, operators that submit ephemeris (trajectory predictions) to the platform will also receive CDMs against Stargaze data, in addition to ephemeris from other participating operators. This ensures that operators have low-latency access to the best available data for conjunction assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze already has a proven track record in its utility for space safety. In late 2025, a Starlink satellite encountered a conjunction with a third-party satellite that was performing maneuvers, but whose operator was not sharing ephemeris. Until five hours before the conjunction, the close approach was anticipated to be ~9,000 meters—considered a safe miss-distance with zero probability of collision. With just five hours to go, the third-party satellite performed a maneuver which changed its trajectory and collapsed the anticipated miss distance to just ~60 meters. Stargaze quickly detected this maneuver and published an updated trajectory to the screening platform, generating new CDMs which were immediately distributed to relevant satellites. Ultimately, the Starlink satellite was able to react within an hour of the maneuver being detected, planning an avoidance maneuver to reduce collision risk back down to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With so little time to react, this would not have been possible by relying on legacy radar systems or high-latency conjunction screening processes. If observations of the third-party satellite were less frequent, conjunction screening took longer, or the reaction required human approval, such an event might not have been successfully mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Stargaze embodies a major improvement to the ability of any operator to fly safely, it is imperative for operators to frequently share ephemeris of their own fleets. This is particularly true for operators with maneuvering vehicles. While Stargaze can detect maneuvers more quickly than any other system in use today, the most definitive source of satellite trajectories should be provided by operators themselves, allowing deconfliction and minimizing collision avoidance maneuvers. Starlink ephemeris is updated and shared publicly every hour, and all other operators should do the same. An appropriate analogy is commercial aviation: there are hundreds of thousands of flights of aircraft daily, but they are able to avoid collisions because they broadcast their location and flight plan to other aircraft. Similarly, spacecraft operators should follow this minimal standard of sharing their predicted trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By providing this ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening service free of charge, we hope to motivate operators to take similar steps towards ephemeris sharing and safe flight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I hacked together a weekend project. What started as “WhatsApp Relay” now has over 100,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I’m excited to announce our new name: OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Naming Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been through some names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clawd was born in November 2025—a playful pun on “Claude” with a claw. It felt perfect until Anthropic’s legal team politely asked us to reconsider. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moltbot came next, chosen in a chaotic 5am Discord brainstorm with the community. Molting represents growth - lobsters shed their shells to become something bigger. It was meaningful, but it never quite rolled off the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is where we land. And this time, we did our homework: trademark searches came back clear, domains have been purchased, migration code has been written. The name captures what this project has become:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open: Open source, open to everyone, community-driven&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claw: Our lobster heritage, a nod to where we came from&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What OpenClaw Is&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs on your machine and works from the chat apps you already use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams—wherever you are, your AI assistant follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else’s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose—laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s New in This Release&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with the rebrand, we’re shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New Channels: Twitch and Google Chat plugins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models: Support for KIMI K2.5 &amp;amp; Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web Chat: Send images just like you can in messaging apps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: 34 security-related commits to harden the codebase&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project. We’ve released machine-checkable security models this week and are continuing to work on additional security improvements. Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem, so it’s important to use strong models and to study our security best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s next? Security remains our top priority. We’re also focused on gateway reliability and adding polish plus support for more models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone. Over the last few days I’ve worked on adding maintainers and we’re slowly setting up processes so we can deal with the insane influx of PRs and Issues. I’m also figuring out how to pay maintainers properly—full-time if possible. If you wanna help, consider contributing or sponsoring the org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank You&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the Claw Crew—every clawtributor who’s shipped code, filed issues, joined our Discord, or just tried the project: thank you. You are what makes OpenClaw special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lobster has molted into its final form. Welcome to OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started: openclaw.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join the Claw Crew: Discord&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Star on GitHub: github.com/openclaw/openclaw&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— Peter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. Yes, the mascot is still a lobster. Some things are sacred. 🦞&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research shows AI helps people do parts of their job faster. In an observational study of Claude.ai data, we found AI can speed up some tasks by 80%. But does this increased productivity come with trade-offs? Other research shows that when people use AI assistance, they become less engaged with their work and reduce the effort they put into doing it—in other words, they offload their thinking to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether this cognitive offloading can prevent people from growing their skills on the job, or—in the case of coding—understanding the systems they’re building. Our latest study, a randomized controlled trial with software developers as participants, investigates this potential downside of using AI at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This question has broad implications—for how to design AI products that facilitate learning, for how workplaces should approach AI policies, and for broader societal resilience, among others. We focused on coding, a field where AI tools have rapidly become standard. Here, AI creates a potential tension: as coding grows more automated and speeds up work, humans will still need the skills to catch errors, guide output, and ultimately provide oversight for AI deployed in high-stakes environments. Does AI provide a shortcut to both skill development and increased efficiency? Or do productivity increases from AI assistance undermine skill development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a randomized controlled trial, we examined 1) how quickly software developers picked up a new skill (in this case, a Python library) with and without AI assistance; and 2) whether using AI made them less likely to understand the code they’d just written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery. On a quiz that covered concepts they’d used just a few minutes before, participants in the AI group scored 17% lower than those who coded by hand, or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. Using AI sped up the task slightly, but this didn’t reach the threshold of statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, using AI assistance didn’t guarantee a lower score. How someone used AI influenced how much information they retained. The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Study design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recruited 52 (mostly junior) software engineers, each of whom had been using Python at least once a week for over a year. We also made sure they were at least somewhat familiar with AI coding assistance, and were unfamiliar with Trio, the Python library on which our tasks were based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We split the study into three parts: a warm-up; the main task consisting of coding two different features using Trio (which requires understanding concepts related to asynchronous programming, a skill often learned in a professional setting); and a quiz. We told participants that a quiz would follow the task, but encouraged them to work as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We designed the coding task to mimic how someone might learn a new tool through a self-guided tutorial. Each participant was given a problem description, starter code, and a brief explanation of the Trio concepts needed to solve it. We used an online coding platform with an AI assistant in the sidebar which had access to participants’ code and could at any time produce the correct code if asked.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Evaluation design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our evaluation design, we drew on research in computer science education to identify four types of questions commonly used to assess mastery of coding skills:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging: The ability to identify and diagnose errors in code. This skill is crucial for detecting when AI-generated code is incorrect and understanding why it fails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code reading: The ability to read and comprehend what code does. This skill enables humans to understand and verify AI-written code before deployment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code writing: The ability to write or select the correct approach to writing code. Low-level code writing, like remembering the syntax of functions, will be less important with the further integration of AI coding tools than high-level system design.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual: The ability to understand the core principles behind tools and libraries. Conceptual understanding is critical for assessing whether AI-generated code uses appropriate software design patterns that adhere to how the library is intended to be used.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our assessment focused most heavily on debugging, code reading, and conceptual problems, as we considered these the most important for providing oversight of what is increasingly likely to be AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen's d=0.738, p=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Qualitative analysis: AI interaction modes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were particularly interested in understanding how participants went about completing the tasks we designed. In our qualitative analysis, we manually annotated screen recordings to identify how much time participants spent composing queries, what types of questions they asked, the types of errors they made, and how much time they spent actively coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One surprising result was how much time participants spent interacting with the AI assistant. Several took up to 11 minutes (30% of the total time allotted) composing up to 15 queries. This helped to explain why, on average, participants using AI finished faster although the productivity improvement was not statistically significant. We expect AI would be more likely to significantly increase productivity when used on repetitive or familiar tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, participants in the No AI group encountered more errors. These included errors in syntax and in Trio concepts, the latter of which mapped directly to topics tested on the evaluation. Our hypothesis is that the participants who encountered more Trio errors (namely, the control group) likely improved their debugging skills through resolving these errors independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then grouped participants by how they interacted with AI, identifying distinct patterns that led to different outcomes in completion time and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-scoring interaction patterns: The low-scoring patterns generally involved a heavy reliance on AI, either through code generation or debugging. The average quiz scores in this group were less than 40%. They showed less independent thinking and more cognitive offloading. We further separated them into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI delegation (n=4): Participants in this group wholly relied on AI to write code and complete the task. They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Progressive AI reliance (n=4): Participants in this group started by asking one or two questions but eventually delegated all code writing to the AI assistant. They scored poorly on the quiz largely due to not mastering any of the concepts on the second task.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterative AI debugging (n=4): Participants in this group relied on AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly as a result, and were also slower at completing the two tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-scoring interaction patterns: We considered high-scoring quiz patterns to be behaviors where the average quiz score was 65% or higher. Participants in these clusters used AI both for code generation and conceptual queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generation-then-comprehension (n=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. After their code was generated, they asked the AI assistant follow-up questions to improve understanding. These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid code-explanation (n=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual inquiry (n=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Although this group encountered many errors, they also independently resolved them. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our qualitative analysis does not draw a causal link between interaction patterns and learning outcomes, but it does point to behaviors associated with different learning outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that incorporating AI aggressively into the workplace, particularly with respect to software engineering, comes with trade-offs. The findings highlight that not all AI-reliance is the same: the way we interact with AI while trying to be efficient affects how much we learn. Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though preliminary, these results suggest important considerations as companies transition to a greater ratio of AI-written to human-written code. Productivity benefits may come at the cost of skills necessary to validate AI-written code if junior engineers’ skill development has been stunted by using AI in the first place. Managers should think intentionally about how to deploy AI tools at scale, and consider systems or intentional design choices that ensure engineers continue to learn as they work—and are thus able to exercise meaningful oversight over the systems they build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For novice workers in software engineering or any other industry, our study can be viewed as a small piece of evidence toward the value of intentional skill development with AI tools. Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery. This is also a lesson that applies to how individuals choose to work with AI, and which tools they use. Major LLM services also provide learning modes (e.g., Claude Code Learning and Explanatory mode or ChatGPT Study Mode) designed to foster understanding. Knowing how people learn when using AI can also help guide how we design it; AI assistance should enable humans to work more efficiently and develop new skills at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior studies have found mixed results on whether AI helps or hinders coding productivity. Our own research found that AI can reduce the time it takes to complete some work tasks by 80%—a result that may seem in tension with the findings presented here. But the two studies ask different questions and use different methods: our earlier observational work measured productivity on tasks where participants already had the relevant skills, while this study examines what happens when people are learning something new. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study is only a first step towards uncovering how human-AI collaboration affects the experience of workers. Our sample was relatively small, and our assessment measured comprehension shortly after the coding task. Whether immediate quiz performance predicts longer-term skill development is an important question this study does not resolve. There remain many unanswered questions we hope future studies will investigate, for example: the effects of AI on tasks beyond coding, whether this effect dissipates longitudinally as engineers develop greater fluency, and whether AI assistance differs from human assistance while learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, to accommodate skill development in the presence of AI, we need a more expansive view of the impacts of AI on workers. In an AI-augmented workplace, productivity gains matter, but so does the long-term development of the expertise those gains depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Judy Hanwen Shen [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:40:43 UTC (2,680 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.CY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is planning a Linux-native GOG Galaxy, calling Linux the 'next major frontier.'&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is hiring a senior engineer to shape Galaxy's architecture for Linux from day one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Galaxy will let Linux users relive classics without the usual headaches.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming on Linux used to be in a nasty catch-22. People wouldn't develop games for Linux because gamers didn't use it, and gamers didn't use Linux because people wouldn't develop games for it. However, with the advancement of tech like Proton, we're beginning to see people take Linux seriously as a gaming powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn't mean that the Linux community won't welcome developers who create Linux-native versions of their games and related apps. So, when the news broke that GOG was hiring a developer to help get its library app over into the world of FOSS, it was good news for everyone who wants to bring the classics over to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;GOG's new owner details how he plans to take on Steam: publish less chaff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world of monopolies, GOG wants a niche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GOG calls Linux "a major frontier" as it aims to make Galaxy Linux-native&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It's the next step in GOG's plans to appeal to Linux users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by VideoCardz, a recent job advertisement on the GOG website revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cicada is a lightweight scripting language that runs inside of C code. For details, see the website:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://heltilda.github.io/cicada&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation: From the command prompt go into the Cicada download directory, and type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ./configure&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; make&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; make install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to use: Include the Cicada header file in your C code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;cicada.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and pass an &lt;code&gt;lcicada&lt;/code&gt; option to the linker:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;gcc -lcicada -o myprogram ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to run Cicada is to call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;runCicada(NULL, NULL, true);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This story was produced and originally published by Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. It was made possible by donors like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did a $1 billion, 520-acre data center proposed by one of the world’s richest companies go unnoticed in tiny Beaver Dam, Wisconsin?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key reason: In a city that lists “communication matters” atop its core values, officials took steps to keep the project hidden for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;News with a little more humanity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” newsletter keeps you connected to the state you love without feeling overwhelmed. No paywall. No agenda. No corporate filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Meta, the trillion-dollar company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is building a complex as big as 12 football fields in a city with a population of 16,000, enough to fill only a fifth of Lambeau Field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s one of seven major data center projects pending in Wisconsin that combined are worth more than $57 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In four of them, including Beaver Dam, local government officials kept the massive projects under wraps through confidential nondisclosure agreements, a Wisconsin Watch investigation has found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secrecy also occurred in the three communities without NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one, the Madison suburb of DeForest, officials worked behind the scenes for months before publicly announcing a proposed $12 billion data center, which residents are fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of public disclosure, while relatively common for typical development proposals in the planning stages, raises questions about how much time the public should have to digest projects that dramatically affect the economy, land use, energy, taxes, the environment and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As soon as community leadership is contemplating, even entertaining it, I think they need to make the public aware,” said retired tech executive Prescott Balch, who is advising residents around Wisconsin where data centers are proposed. “Even if it makes it harder, that’s the right way to do it. And nobody is doing it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blowback from residents who have been kept in the dark has spurred a new legislative proposal that would ban data center NDAs statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Beaver Dam did it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has some 40 data centers, stretching from Kenosha to Eau Claire. But most are tiny compared with the big seven: three under construction in Beaver Dam, Mount Pleasant and Port Washington; and four proposed in DeForest, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides storing and processing data, data centers are vital to advancing the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A case study in how projects each worth $1 billion or more are kept quiet is Beaver Dam, the Dodge County burg an hour northeast of Madison, where Meta’s data center is expected to open in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beaver Dam Area Development Corp., a quasi-government nonprofit that functions as the city’s economic development arm, signed an NDA on Dec. 1, 2023, not with Meta, but with a shell company no one had ever heard of, Balloonist LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agreement referred only to a “project,” making no mention of a data center or Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA was signed “very early, almost in the introductory period of that project,” the development corporation’s leader, Trent Campbell, told Wisconsin Watch. All major development projects have “different levels of confidentiality for different purposes. And this entity believed it to be necessary at the onset of the conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA meant that the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. could not reveal its discussions with Balloonist, or even disclose “the existence of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA also put the wheels in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a year, the city quietly took official actions to make the data center a reality, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2024: The city council voted 12-0 to approve a predevelopment agreement with another shell company, Degas LLC, that only later was identified with the data center. The agenda and the minutes of the meeting don’t mention a data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 2024: The city council created a tax incremental finance, or TIF, district for the data center to help fund development. The agenda and the minutes for that meeting do not mention a data center, though the agreement itself does.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not until February 2025 — 14 months after the NDA was signed — did the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. announce that it and the city were working with a company — then still unidentified — on a “potential data center project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Campbell noted to Wisconsin Watch that Gov. Tony Evers and other officials had identified the site for a major development as far back as 2019. For months after the NDA was signed, it wasn’t known whether the data center would come to fruition, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know the opponents currently disagree, but I think the city acted in as transparent a way as they could,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, a news report in April 2025 identified Meta, which declined comment for this story, as the company likely behind the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta confirmed its involvement eight months later, saying on Facebook: “We’re proud to call Beaver Dam home. We are honored to have joined such an incredible community in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first reply to that post was from a Beaver Dam resident, who wrote: “We would have been honored to have the opportunity to decline this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secrecy without an NDA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs also helped keep the public in the dark about data centers under consideration in the three other cities that used them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Menomonie signed its NDA with Balloonist LLC in February 2024 — more than a year before the city in northwest Wisconsin announced a $1.6 billion data center proposal in July 2025. Two months after the NDA, the city council unanimously helped pave the way for a data center by changing a land use ordinance. The change gave, for the first time, a definition of the ordinance’s reference to “warehousing,” saying warehousing includes data centers. The city’s mayor put the proposed data center on hold in September 2025. In January 2026, the city council adopted a zoning ordinance for data centers that reversed the warehousing definition. “Based upon feedback from the community and elected officials, it is clear that additional discussion should occur regarding the appropriate level of regulation of data centers,” the city’s public works director told the council and the mayor.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kenosha signed its NDA, with Microsoft, in May 2024, six months before news reports surfaced saying the NDA kept the proposed data center operator’s name confidential. It was later announced that Microsoft had purchased 240 acres in the neighboring town of Paris, which the city annexed in December 2024. No dollar amount for the proposal has been announced.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Janesville announced in July 2025 it was approached by developers about a data center and put out a request for proposal. The city signed its NDA two months later and is now in negotiations with Viridian Acquisitions, a Colorado developer, for an $8 billion data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Port Washington in Ozaukee County and Mount Pleasant in Racine County responded to records requests from Wisconsin Watch saying they had not signed NDAs for their data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Port Washington, where three people were arrested during a city council meeting on the data center in December, residents are trying to recall Mayor Ted Neitzke, saying he has been secretive about the $15 billion data center from OpenAI, Oracle and Vantage Data Centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft this month announced plans to add 15 data centers, worth $13 billion, to the $7 billion complex under construction there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs are described by economic development officials as necessary and criticized by data center opponents as against the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs and other steps to protect confidentiality are crucial at the early stages of a development proposal, said Tricia Braun, executive director of the Wisconsin Data Center Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If I’m a company considering making strategic investments, regardless of industry, I don’t want my competition to know where I’m going, what I’m doing, what pace I’m doing it at,” said Braun, a former executive at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. “You want to make sure everything is buttoned up and bow tied before that type of information is put into the public realm.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Questions have swirled around transparency even in communities where local government officials did not sign NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That includes DeForest, which lists “communicate clearly” among its core values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DeForest data center, proposed by Virginia-based QTS Data Centers, is controversial, in part, because the village board would have to annex 1,600 acres in the neighboring town of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At one DeForest Village Board meeting about the project, Village President Jane Cahill Wolfgram said that based on emails she had been receiving from residents, there was “just one thing I think we need to clear up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And you can ask any one of these board members. They will tell you, they just learned about this project in the last couple of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was Nov. 18, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Village Board trustees had been offered one-on-one meetings with the developer some 10 weeks earlier, trustee Jan Steffenhagen-Hahn said in an email to Vienna resident Shawn Haney.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because of the scale of this project,” that’s when residents should have been notified, said Haney, a leader of a group that opposes the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other emails obtained by the group show that DeForest staff were strategizing with QTS representatives and Alliant Energy as early as March 2025 — seven months before announcing the proposal last October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one email, the village planner discussed with QTS representatives when to seek various village approvals, including annexation, while acknowledging that doing so without disclosing “any details of the project or operations will be difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cahill Wolfgram told Wisconsin Watch she in fact had met with QTS on Oct. 1, three weeks before the public announcement. She expressed frustration that many residents are urging trustees to stop the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’ve been brought in from the very early moments of this discussion and they have continued to be front and center of everything we’ve done,” Cahill Wolfgram said. “As village president, I know of nothing that has been done behind the scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A public hearing on the annexation is scheduled for Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state Department of Administration, which reviews annexation proposals and issues advisory opinions, concluded the DeForest annexation is not in the public interest because of concerns over how the village would provide water and sewer services for the annexed area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin has called for state leaders to pause consideration of any data centers until a comprehensive strategy on them is adopted. In part, the coalition said comprehensive planning is needed to avoid more “stranded assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin Watch reported in December that Wisconsin utility ratepayers owe nearly $1 billion for stranded assets — coal power plants that have been or soon will be shut down. A push to provide new energy capacity for data centers poses the risk of creating more stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some states targeting NDAs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Jan. 13 announced new standards aimed at being a “good neighbor in the communities where we build, own and operate our data centers.” It mentioned transparency five times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers called Microsoft’s initial Mount Pleasant data center a “microcosm of a larger problem with secrecy and lack of transparency about water and electricity demands” of data centers throughout the country. That, they wrote, “harms the public’s ability to determine whether hosting a data center is in their best interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Pleasant has wanted a major development where the data center is now under construction because a massive development signed with Foxconn in 2017 largely fell through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local government use of NDAs and other methods to keep data center development secret is widespread across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, local elected officials were aware of data center proposals for months or even years before disclosing them. In Virginia, 25 out of 31 data center projects had NDAs. In one New Mexico county, county staff negotiated for a $165 billion data center with an NDA that kept elected officials in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several states are targeting NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least three — Florida, Michigan and New Jersey — are considering legislation to prohibit governments from signing data center NDAs. A Georgia bill would prohibit NDAs that hide information about data center electricity or water usage. New York is considering a bill to limit NDAs for economic development proposals generally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, similar legislation is pending in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, state Rep. Clint Moses, R-Menomonie, citing questions about transparency over the Menomonie proposal, introduced a bill to prohibit NDAs for data center proposals in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve never seen such overwhelming opposition from all sides of the aisle,” he told Wisconsin Watch, describing constituents’ feelings about data centers and secrecy surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moses said he understands the need for confidentiality in economic development generally, but that because data centers have such widespread impact, public notice is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The earlier the better,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Braun, the data centers coalition leader, said the public should be notified when a data center proposal is ready to be considered for approvals by elected officials — after municipal staff do due diligence to determine whether things such as zoning, utility capacity, water and sewer would make a proposal potentially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Balch, who helped defeat a proposed data center in the Racine County village of Caledonia, where he lives, said the public should be alerted well before local elected officials consider such votes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You have to use your judgment,” he said. “But at some point, you need to realize this is not a normal thing and we need to look out for the residents.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Every popular agent framework runs LLM-generated code via &lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;. That's arbitrary code execution on your host. One prompt injection and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Code Executors docs&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SWE-Agent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run(["bash", ...])&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SWE-ReX&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some frameworks offer Docker isolation (OpenHands, AutoGen), but that requires running a Docker daemon and managing container infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;amla-sandbox is a WASM sandbox with capability enforcement. Agents can only call tools you explicitly provide, with constraints you define. Sandboxed virtual filesystem. No network. No shell escape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv pip install "git+https://github.com/amlalabs/amla-sandbox"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Docker. No VM. One binary, works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[stripe_api, database])

# Agent writes one script instead of 10 tool calls (JavaScript)
result = sandbox.run('''
    const txns = await stripe.listTransactions({customer: "cus_123"});
    const disputed = txns.filter(t =&amp;gt; t.disputed);
    console.log(disputed[0]);
''', language="javascript")

# Or with shell pipelines
result = sandbox.run('''
    tool stripe.listTransactions --customer cus_123 | jq '[.[] | select(.disputed)] | .[0]'
''', language="shell")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tool-calling is expensive. Every MCP call is a round trip through the model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → tool → LLM → tool → LLM → tool → ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten tool calls = ten LLM invocations. Code mode collapses this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → script that does all 10 things → result
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can't just eval whatever the model spits out. So people either pay the token tax or run unsafe code. This gives you both: code-mode efficiency with actual isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox runs inside WebAssembly with WASI for a minimal syscall interface. WASM provides memory isolation by design—linear memory is bounds-checked, and there's no way to escape to the host address space. The wasmtime runtime we use is built with defense-in-depth and has been formally verified for memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of WASM isolation, every tool call goes through capability validation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import Sandbox, MethodCapability, ConstraintSet, Param

sandbox = Sandbox(
    capabilities=[
        MethodCapability(
            method_pattern="stripe/charges/*",
            constraints=ConstraintSet([
                Param("amount") &amp;lt;= 10000,
                Param("currency").is_in(["USD", "EUR"]),
            ]),
            max_calls=100,
        ),
    ],
    tool_handler=my_handler,
)

# This works
sandbox.execute('await stripe.charges.create({amount: 500, currency: "USD"})')

# This fails - amount exceeds capability
sandbox.execute('await stripe.charges.create({amount: 50000, currency: "USD"})')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design draws from capability-based security as implemented in systems like seL4—access is explicitly granted, not implicitly available. Agents don't get ambient authority just because they're running in your process. This matters because prompt injection is a fundamental unsolved problem; defense in depth through capability restriction limits the blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool()

# JavaScript
sandbox.run("console.log('hello'.toUpperCase())", language="javascript")  # -&amp;gt; "HELLO"

# Shell
sandbox.run("echo 'hello' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'", language="shell")  # -&amp;gt; "HELLO"

# With tools
def get_weather(city: str) -&amp;gt; dict:
    return {"city": city, "temp": 72}

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[get_weather])
sandbox.run("const w = await get_weather({city: 'SF'}); console.log(w);", language="javascript")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(
    tools=[transfer_money],
    constraints={
        "transfer_money": {
            "amount": "&amp;lt;=1000",
            "currency": ["USD", "EUR"],
        },
    },
    max_calls={"transfer_money": 10},
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools require object syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// WORKS - tools always take an object argument
await get_weather({city: "SF"});
await transfer({to: "alice", amount: 500});

// FAILS - positional arguments don't work
await get_weather("SF");  // Error: argument after ** must be a mapping&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; for output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Return value is captured and output
return await get_weather({city: "SF"});  // -&amp;gt; {"city":"SF","temp":72}
return {a: 1, b: 2};  // -&amp;gt; {"a":1,"b":2}
return "hello";  // -&amp;gt; hello (strings not double-quoted)

// console.log also works
console.log(JSON.stringify({a: 1}));  // -&amp;gt; {"a":1}

// No return = no output
const x = 42;  // -&amp;gt; (no output)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VFS is writable only under /workspace and /tmp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// WORKS - /workspace and /tmp are ReadWrite
await fs.writeFile('/workspace/data.json', '{}');
await fs.mkdir('/tmp/cache');

// FAILS - root is read-only
await fs.mkdir('/mydir');  // EACCES: Permission denied&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For LangGraph integration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[get_weather, search_db])
agent = create_react_agent(
    ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    [sandbox.as_langchain_tool()]  # LLM writes JS/shell that calls your tools
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fine-grained capability control:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import SandboxTool, MethodCapability, ConstraintSet, Param

caps = [
    MethodCapability(
        method_pattern="mcp:search_db",
        constraints=ConstraintSet([Param("query").starts_with("SELECT")]),
        max_calls=5,
    )
]

sandbox_tool = SandboxTool.from_functions([search_db], capabilities=caps)
agent = create_react_agent(model, [sandbox_tool.as_langchain_tool()])&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox yields on tool calls. Host executes them (after capability checks) and resumes. QuickJS runs inside WASM for the JS runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First run compiles the WASM module (~300ms). Cache it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;amla-precompile&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subsequent loads: ~0.5ms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import Param, ConstraintSet

constraints = ConstraintSet([
    Param("amount") &amp;gt;= 100,

    Param("currency").is_in(["USD", "EUR"]),
    Param("path").starts_with("/api/"),

    &lt;p&gt;Pattern matching for method names:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;stripe/charges/*&lt;/code&gt;— single path segment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;stripe/**&lt;/code&gt;— zero or more segments&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you get: Isolation without infrastructure. Capability enforcement. Token efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you don't get: Full Linux environment. Native module support. GPU access. Infinite loop protection (a &lt;code&gt;while(true){}&lt;/code&gt; will hang - the step limit only counts WASM yields, not JS instructions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need a real VM with persistent state and arbitrary dependencies, use e2b or Modal. amla-sandbox is for the common case: agents running generated code with controlled tool access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python code is MIT. The WASM binary is proprietary—you can use it with this package but can't extract or redistribute it separately.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wallace and Gromit Font&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Categories:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new typeface for Aardman’s iconic duo – meet Buttered Crumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to be selected to design a custom typeface for Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit – Aardman’s most beloved and recognisable characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brief called for a font with a distinct tone of voice that could work seamlessly across film, print and digital, while bringing warmth and continuity to their next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Method&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We began by exploring warm, characterful styles, taking inspiration from Oswald Cooper’s original drawings for Cooper Black. We then took a creative turn, developing a softer, low-contrast design with a distinctly hand-crafted feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each letterform was carefully shaped to feel expressive yet balanced, with serifs that resemble loaves of bread – a nod to Aardman’s tactile, playful world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outcomes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The finished typeface – Buttered Crumpet – gives Aardman a timeless, familiar tone of voice with bundles of charm. It includes over 200 characters, covering all Western European languages, and was designed in a single, carefully crafted weight with room for future expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Bristol-based designer, it was a joy to create a lasting connection with my home city and one of its most renowned creative studios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I’ve loved rolling out this typeface and we’re starting to see it in action now. There have been lots of compliments.&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; 1. Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is an umbrella term for a range of conditions involving neurodegeneration or other aetiologies that result in significant cognitive decline, the most common of which is Alzheimer’s disease [&lt;/p&gt;1&lt;p&gt;]. The cognitive decline observed in people with Alzheimer’s disease involves the gradual accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta and tau proteins causing neuronal damage [&lt;/p&gt;2&lt;p&gt;], so identifying those people with signs of Alzheimer’s-related cognitive decline as early as possible would enable interventions to be utilised to delay or even prevent some of the damage. People with dementia may first notice they have an issue when they experience increased episodes of confusion or issues with memory or language (e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;3&lt;p&gt;]). However, Alzheimer’s pathology likely begins many years and perhaps decades before the onset of symptoms [&lt;/p&gt;4&lt;p&gt;]. Indeed, research has shown that there are earlier warning signs of dementia which may be too subtle for a patient to be aware of, for example, problems with attention (e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;5&lt;p&gt;]). Further, research suggests that it is currently possible to predict who will experience dementia 12 years prior to formal diagnosis [&lt;/p&gt;6&lt;p&gt;]. Therefore, it may be possible to identify at-risk people before their cognitive decline worsens. Dementia has an effect on both speech and writing (e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;7&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;8&lt;p&gt;]); therefore, measuring the first signs of decline in these functions may provide an early biomarker for dementia. In early-stage Alzheimer’s, researchers have observed impairments in both producing and understanding words and sentences [&lt;/p&gt;9&lt;p&gt;]. Therefore, by looking for changes in how someone uses language, then this may provide an early warning sign for dementia. The complexity of sentence structure, as measured by factors like the number of clauses per utterance, decreases with age in both spoken and written language [&lt;/p&gt;10&lt;p&gt;]. Older adults struggle more with complex sentence structures, such as those with left-branching clauses, compared to younger adults [&lt;/p&gt;11&lt;p&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, linguistic changes are to be expected as people age (e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;12&lt;p&gt;]). However, these changes become more profound within people with cognitive decline (e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;13&lt;p&gt;]). If a patient’s writing history is available, then linguistic analysis techniques could be used to supplement clinical assessments or as a standalone early detection tool. Recent studies have done exactly this by measuring individual writers’ publications over their careers to analyse how their language use has evolved. Garrard et al. [&lt;/p&gt;14&lt;p&gt;] studied the works of Iris Murdoch, a renowned English author who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s posthumously. Her final novel, published shortly before her diagnosis, is widely considered to exhibit signs of cognitive decline. While Garrard found minimal differences in overall structure and syntax, they observed significant and consistent variations in lexical diversity and word choice between the final book and control books from earlier in Murdoch’s career. These results provide evidence that Alzheimer’s may indeed be measured using linguistic analysis, specifically the number of unique word-types relative to the overall wordcount. Le et al. [&lt;/p&gt;15&lt;p&gt;] explored this further by including additional authors, additional books, and improved analysis techniques. Le et al. analysed two authors believed to have Alzheimer’s disease during their careers, Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie, as well as P.D. James to act as a control participant, who published until the age of 88 without experiencing evidence of cognitive decline. They included twenty of Murdoch’s twenty-six novels, published between ages 35 and 76, sixteen of Christie’s novels written between ages 28 and 82, and fifteen of the novels of P.D. James. They then produced an analysis of the novels at the lexical level, using a variety of measures, including vocabulary size, lexical repetition, lexical specificity, word-class deficits, and fillers. Type-token ratio (TTR: e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;16&lt;p&gt;]) calculates the proportion of unique words to the total wordcount, and the word-type introduction rate (WTIR: e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;17&lt;p&gt;]), which measures the rate at which new words are introduced in the text, calculated every 10,000 words. Regarding lexical repetition, while intentional repetition can be a stylistic device, an increasing rate of repeated words may suggest a limited vocabulary or difficulty accessing words. To examine this, they conducted two analyses: a global analysis and a local analysis. Lexical specificity is calculated by the frequency of indefinite nouns and high-frequency, low-imagery verbs in each text. A higher proportion of these generic words suggests lower overall lexical specificity. Word class deficit (WCD: e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;18&lt;p&gt;]) is an analysis of the distribution of word classes across each text, examining both the total number of words and the number of unique words. This allows for identification of potential deficits or overreliance on specific word classes and to measure the vocabulary size of open classes. Filler words are a measure of the proportion of interjections and filler words. While these words often appear in dialogue, fiction authors strive for natural-sounding conversations. However, this measure may be influenced by stylistic choices rather than cognitive decline and should be interpreted with care. Le, et al. observed that P.D. James maintained stable linguistic diversity into their late 80s, whereas, for Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie TTR and WTIR were associated with cognitive decline and a decline in vocabulary led to an increase in repetitions in content words, and a word-class deficit can be seen in noun-token proportion, with a compensatory increase in verb-token proportion. They also observed a deficit in noun tokens that is significantly correlated with a rise in verb and pronoun tokens. Syntactic-complexity results were also found to fluctuate in a relatively wider range. Interestingly, they also report that deficits in Murdoch’s writing appeared in Murdoch’s late 40s and early 50s, which suggests that language deficits are observed many years before a formal diagnosis and indicates that Alzheimer’s disease has a long preclinical period. Therefore, linguistic analysis would appear to show promise in identifying whether an author has experienced cognitive decline and may even indicate when the preclinical phase of dementia has begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current research further explores the idea of using lexical analysis in dementia by studying the works of Sir Terry Pratchett. Terry Pratchett was an English author, humourist, and satirist, best known for his Discworld series of 41 comic fantasy novels published between 1983 and 2015. Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) in December 2007. This diagnosis came at a time when he was still actively writing and publishing his beloved Discworld series. Despite the challenges posed by his condition, Pratchett continued to write and advocate for dementia awareness until his passing in 2015. PCA is a rare form of Alzheimer’s disease that primarily affects visual processing and spatial awareness [&lt;/p&gt;19&lt;p&gt;]: although note that 15% of PCA cases may be unrelated to AD pathology; see [&lt;/p&gt;20&lt;p&gt;]. It affects areas in the back of the brain responsible for spatial perception, complex visual processing, spelling, and calculation [&lt;/p&gt;21&lt;p&gt;]. PCA has also been found to be associated with word retrieval difficulties [&lt;/p&gt;22&lt;p&gt;]. Given Terry Pratchett’s prolific writing career and the fact he continued writing after his diagnosis, a linguistic analysis of his novels could provide valuable insights into the potential early signs of cognitive decline. By comparing his earlier works to his later ones, particularly those written closer to his dementia diagnosis, it would be possible to identify subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, and a decline in the use of specific word classes, such as nouns and adjectives, potentially preceding clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study further explores the potential of lexical analysis as a tool for the early detection of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, an author diagnosed with PCA. By analysing his Discworld series, it may be possible to identify subtle changes in linguistic patterns, specifically lexical diversity, that may have occurred prior to his formal diagnosis. Novels from the Discworld series were analysed to identify subtle changes in linguistic patterns, specifically lexical diversity as measured by TTR and Moving Average TTR (MATTR: e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;23&lt;p&gt;]). The analysis focuses on whether these measures changed over time and their accuracy in predicting the linguistic changes associated with his diagnosis is evaluated. These findings may have implications for the use of lexical analysis in dementia research, highlighting its potential as a supplementary tool for early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; 2. Materials and Methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 2.1. Materials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lexical diversity was quantified across 33 of the 41 novels in the Discworld series. Eight titles were excluded from the analysis due to them being either shorter than the other full-length novels (Eric, 1990; The Last Hero, 2001), or because they are part of his titles for younger readers (The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents, 2001; The Wee Free Men, 2003; A Hat Full of Sky, 2004; Wintersmith, 2006; I Shall Wear Midnight, 2010; The Shepherds Crown, 2015). These eight titles were excluded to ensure the validity of the lexical analysis. TTR is highly sensitive to text length; therefore, shorter works (e.g., Eric, which was originally published as an illustrated picture book) would yield artificially inflated diversity scores compared to full-length novels. Additionally, works written for younger readers were omitted because linguistic constraints and vocabulary choices for children differ fundamentally from those used in the main series. By focusing on a homogeneous corpus of adult-marketed, full-length novels, we ensured that observed changes reflect cognitive status rather than shifts in intended audience or format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 2.2. Data Extraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis focused on four major lexical word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The corpus-analysis platform SketchEngine [&lt;/p&gt;24&lt;p&gt;] was selected for data extraction because it supports large corpora, provides reliable part-of-speech tagging, and allows the retrieval of lemma-level frequency counts for specified word classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plain-text versions of the 33 eligible novels were uploaded to SketchEngine. For each book, the number of unique lemmas in each word class was divided by the total number of tokens of that class, yielding a class-specific TTR. These measures provided an initial estimate of lexical diversity across the corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To investigate potential effects of cognitive decline, novels were grouped according to publication relative to Pratchett’s PCA diagnosis in 2007: 29 books were classified as pre-diagnosis and 4 as post-diagnosis. Because TTR is sensitive to text length and unequal token counts across books, we additionally computed the moving-average type–token ratio (MATTR) with a fixed window size of 100 words. MATTR normalises diversity estimates across texts of different lengths and provides a more stable measure of lexical variation. These MATTR values were then included in subsequent statistical comparisons of pre- and post-diagnosis linguistic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MATTR is widely regarded as one of the most robust normalised diversity metrics, as it maintains sensitivity to lexical variation while minimising the length dependency that affects traditional TTR measures. Importantly, MATTR offers advantages over alternative normalisation procedures such as random sampling, fixed-sample TTR, or computationally intensive indices such as Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) or Hypergeometric Distribution (HD-D). Random sampling or fixed-sample TTR can introduce instability when texts differ markedly in style or local density of lexical items, while MTLD and HD-D, although informative, are more sensitive to distributional irregularities and may produce inflated variability when applied to long narrative texts. In contrast, MATTR computes TTR across overlapping windows, ensuring that all parts of a text contribute equally. This property makes MATTR particularly well suited for comparing long-form prose of variable length, such as the Discworld novels, and for detecting subtle changes in lexical choices over time. These MATTR values were therefore used in the statistical comparisons of pre- and post-diagnosis linguistic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 2.3. Statistical Analyses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarise the key linguistic features used in Pratchett’s books. Independent t-tests were used to compare linguistic measures released before and after the dementia diagnosis. Linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between various TTR types and age. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to evaluate the accuracy of TTR measures in distinguishing between pre- and post-diagnosis phases. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 29), with the significance level set at p &amp;lt; 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; 4. Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study aimed to explore the potential of lexical analysis as a tool for early detection of cognitive decline, specifically focusing on the case of Terry Pratchett and his diagnosis of PCA due to Alzheimer’s disease. Our analysis of Pratchett’s Discworld series revealed significant changes in linguistic patterns over time. The most notable finding was a significant decrease in lexical diversity, as measured by TTR, and then MATTR, for adjectives and nouns in Pratchett’s later works. This suggests a decline in vocabulary richness and a reliance on simpler language structures. While the overall TTR remained relatively stable, the decrease in lexical diversity within specific word classes indicates a subtle but significant change in linguistic style (see [&lt;/p&gt;15&lt;p&gt;]). Our analysis of Pratchett’s works suggests that similar lexical changes could potentially also be observed in individuals with PCA due to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high predictive accuracy of TTR measures, particularly for adjectives, suggests that lexical analysis could be a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. By identifying subtle changes in language use, it may be possible to detect preclinical changes in cognitive decline or even the onset of dementia years before a formal diagnosis. This early detection could enable timely interventions and potentially slow the progression of the disease. The analysis revealed a shift in Pratchett’s writing style following the publication of The Last Continent (Discworld 22). This book may indicate the point where the developing dementia pathology first becomes symptomatic, as it was the first to exhibit a TTR for adjectives below an AUC-established cut-off value of 0.227, a threshold with a high diagnostic accuracy for potentially detecting linguistic changes related to dementia in the Discworld series. To further investigate this shift, we compared linguistic features in books published before and after The Last Continent. The results revealed significant differences across various measures. Post-Last Continent books exhibited a significant decrease in lexical diversity across all word classes as measured by TTR. These findings suggest a shift in Pratchett’s writing style after this point. It should be noted that this book was published 9 years and 7 months before his formal diagnosis, indicating a long preclinical period prior to diagnosis. This observation is striking and highlights the potential for lexical analysis to identify subtle changes in writing style that may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high classification accuracy observed in the ROC analysis (e.g., AUC = 0.91 for adjective TTR) provides robust evidence of a distinct shift in linguistic patterns following Book 22. However, it is important to distinguish between the intra-individual predictive power shown here and inter-individual clinical utility. In this study, the ROC curve functions as a tool to retrospectively identify the onset of a pathological trend within a single author’s long-term output. While these findings highlight the sensitivity of lexical diversity as a marker for preclinical cognitive decline, the specific cut-off values (such as the 0.227 threshold for adjectives) are calibrated to Pratchett’s unique baseline vocabulary and the specific genre requirements of the Discworld series. Therefore, these metrics do not serve as a universal screening tool for the general population. Instead, they demonstrate the potential for personalised, longitudinal linguistic monitoring—where a patient serves as their own control—to flag early signs of neurodegeneration that might be missed by standardised, cross-sectional cognitive assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, the analysis was based on a single case study, limiting the generalisability of the findings. The results may be specific to Pratchett; therefore, further research is needed to validate these findings in a larger sample of individuals with dementia, including those with PCA. Relatedly, as this is a single-case study, without a control author, it remains possible that the decline in lexical diversity reflects natural ageing. But note that previous research [&lt;/p&gt;15&lt;p&gt;] has found that healthy authors can maintain stable linguistic diversity into their late 80s, suggesting that the decline observed in Pratchett’s TTR is indicative of pathology rather than typical ageing. Second, a potential limitation of the analyses is that the 33 novels, produced over a 32-year career, may naturally be correlated and thus not strictly independent. While ignoring such dependencies can violate statistical assumptions and overstate significance, treating each work as a discrete “snapshot” of the author’s cognitive state is scientifically justified. This approach views each novel as a massive, distinct creative undertaking and aligns with established methodologies used to map cognitive decline in authors like Iris Murdoch and Agatha Christie [&lt;/p&gt;14&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;15&lt;p&gt;]. Third, while PCA and Alzheimer’s disease share some common features and PCA is thought to be in most cases caused by Alzheimer’s disease (see [&lt;/p&gt;25&lt;p&gt;]), they are distinct conditions with different clinical presentations [&lt;/p&gt;19&lt;p&gt;]. It is possible that the linguistic markers of PCA may differ from those of Alzheimer’s disease. For example, PCA often causes severe reading impairments and “pure alexia,” which disrupts the writer’s ability to visually scan and review their own text. Writers unable to effectively read their drafts may struggle to detect unwanted lexical repetitions and potentially may contribute to the observed decline in lexical richness. Furthermore, several methodological limitations should be considered. The precise chronology of Pratchett’s writing is uncertain. We do not know the exact dates of writing for each book, whether he worked on multiple books concurrently, or if the publication order accurately reflects the writing order. These uncertainties could introduce potential biases into the analysis. Additionally, the observed changes in Pratchett’s writing style after his diagnosis may not solely be attributed to PCA. Factors such as reduced writing time due to the disease, potential collaboration with other writers, or significant editorial alterations could also have contributed to these changes. Finally, it is crucial to emphasise that the observed changes in Pratchett’s writing may not exclusively reflect cognitive decline due to PCA. Age-related changes in writing style are expected, and it is possible that some of the observed changes represent natural stylistic evolution rather than disease-related decline. Further, it is also worthy of note that Pratchett was writing with full knowledge of his condition and prognosis, which may have added a powerful psychological dimension to any biological influences on the language system. Therefore, we cannot wholly attribute changes in language due to Alzheimer’s disease pathology alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of linguistic analysis as a tool for detecting early signs of cognitive decline. By analysing the works of Terry Pratchett, we have demonstrated how subtle changes in language use can be indicative of underlying cognitive impairment. Further research is needed to explore the full potential of linguistic analysis as a diagnostic tool for dementia, including the development of more sophisticated analytical methods and the investigation of larger and more diverse datasets. Future research could explore the use of computational linguistics and machine learning analysis techniques, to identify linguistic markers of cognitive decline. These techniques already show promise and are rapidly gaining attention in Alzheimer’s disease biomarker development (e.g., [&lt;/p&gt;26&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;27&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;28&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;29&lt;p&gt;]). By developing more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tools, we may be able to improve early detection and intervention for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
