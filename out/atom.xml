  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost all transactional emails are being marked as suspicious even when their SPF/DKIM records are fine and they’ve been whitelisted before. Did Google break something in gmail/spam filtering?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Briefly, this morning, I had the opposite effect happen to my Gmail inbox in which things that would normally land in the social and updates folders ended up in my primary folder. I don't know which I'd be more freaked out by: a broken Gmail spam filter or 18 inches of snow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, me as well. Thought I had mistakenly changed something but I hadn't. Have also noticed that ad blockers stopped working last week; now as well as the wrong routing in Gmail, that casting to Chromecast from Chrome stopped working today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a great reminder of how good this feature is that we take for granted. I think this outage has actually improved my appreciation for Gmail (a service I normally only complain about).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously. I didn't even realize this was a wide issue, but I couldn't find a school enrolment email I was looking for this morning, and found it in the spam folder. The fact that I basically never have to do this is actually amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder about difference in experience that different people have with gmail’s spam filter. In my case, the majority of emails that go to my gmail spam folder are legitimate. I don’t actually receive much spam, a single-digit number of emails per month (in the past 30 days, 2 emails), so any time I see anything in my spam folder I have to check so that I can rescue the email if legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my experience also. Closely guarded email, haven't received _any_ spam to it to date, but a large volume of false positives. This, among other reasons, actually led to my setting up my own email server again. Gmail is a great product if you don't know what you're doing or have avaliable to you. It's like a McDonalds burger. Not inpressive, not good, bot bad either, and certainly won't offend anyone while being accessible --- but calling it good is a bit out of touch with what good looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kinda expect there are a lot of false positives that people just never notice because they've got also thousands of unread (non-spam) emails in their inbox and never check their spam to see if there's anything legitimate there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have run my own mail server for years and I rarely see spam. I'm running a classic Bayesian filter as outlined in the legendary PG post "A Plan For Spam" and it works very well. I don't really get all the fuss about this issue. When I do see a piece of unclassified spam I simply classify it and continue. For me this is a far better tradeoff than having all my most private mail on some bigcorp server where any nerd can rifle through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; For me this is a far better tradeoff than having all my most private mail on some bigcorp server where any nerd can rifle through it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've functionally given yourself very little extra privacy because the vast majority of emails you send or receive will still cross through BigCorp servers (whether Google, Microsoft, Intuit, or other).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do the work to run your own mail server, but so few other people do that one end of the conversation is still almost always feeding a corporation's data lake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, if you're communicating with someone else who does the same (or uses a niche hosted provider), that entire conversation is outside their "data lake".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm running my own mail server for longer than I'd like to admit, but not for my critical/key email addresses. Looking at the spam filtering I get in Gmail and knowing my endless fights with spamassassin and DSBLs I know I could never achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only upside of having an actual mail server is the ability to say "this is incorrect, no one ever tried to send an email to this address/from this IP" or custom 55x messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, my Gmail inbox is full of regular senders being flagged as "possibly unsafe" and I need to click a button "Looks Safe" to accept them. They are not being spamboxed, but they are definitely flagged. Even official communications from the USPS!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason given is that "Gmail hasn't scanned this message", so I suppose the scanners are unavailable/disabled for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They should also be tagged as "Important" but they are not. I believe this is a heuristic-based designation, and it has not been working too great lately. My most important mail is coming through as "unimportant".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are not being marked as "Suspicious" but they are showing an infobox that explains they could not be scanned at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could click "Seems Safe" on these messages, but they are not scanned by Google, and they are simply adding a disclaimer that they currently can't vouch for the safety of a message that they couldn't scan. It seems to me that this is a prudent and helpful course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been “down” for me for a few months now, ever since Google tied this functionality to the same toggle that opts you in for using your email data for AI training. So now you can’t filter this stuff without also agreeing to a whole swath of unrelated and opt-ins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ive since gone on an unsubscribe campaign, and things seem bearable now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works with most real companies. If you signed up for it, you can generally unsubscribe from it. It’s easy to do by mistake, and some default to yes with no option during sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t care about whatever new shows Netflix has. Unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t care about my DNS registrar having a sale. Unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google postmaster notices when you hit the one-click unsubscribe button and severely punishes senders that continue to send. It's worth using as long as you understand that some senders will never allow you to sign up again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same here. Until recently I would get maybe 1-2 spams a month, and I just got 30 in the span of a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re the very obvious, very obnoxious kind of spam, and Gmail still correctly sends them to the junk bin, so I wonder if they were shadowbanned before and Google simply decided to make the process more explicit (which I don’t hate on principle).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either that or my address was scrapped from somewhere by a spam bot and the timing is coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google just let through an email spoofed from my own domain (via a mailgun server). It was a phishing attack about the domain being shut down. The connection between the domain name and my personal email address have never been published. Either google or Squarespace leaked the info.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank goodness. My Gmail address is my first name so I typically get many hundreds of spam’s a day which are almost all caught. Dozens in my inbox today so I figured something was up. Glad it’s not that the spam pedlars have suddenly gotten clever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see nothing amiss on my oldest Gmail account. But then, I get probably &amp;lt;1 spam email a day on average, and even less legitimate mail, and even less that isn't an automatic notification of something or other that's already filtered and categorized by sender.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today gmail labelled an email coming from google search console as potentially dangerous, however it was because it couldn't properly do spam filtering on the email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been receiving a large number of spam emails in my "Important and Unread" areas which is anomalous. I was wondering exactly why and this helps. thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step zero. Never disclose your email address to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very easy and straightforward. I operate 6 Gmail accounts, and three are "alts" where I've basically never given the address out to anyone at all, and they receive zero spam, zero UCE, zero marketing emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, on my "main" I've disclosed the address to many entities and I use it for sign-in and shipping and many things. And yes, I do receive spam and scam emails there, but wcyd?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a “reset” a few years ago where I moved to a fresh gmail address, forwarded my old one, and updated all my accounts to use Apple’s Hide My Email service, unique per sender.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a few years of updating addresses that I’d missed whenever something showed up that was forwarded from my old gmail account, I shut down my old account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No more spam, whenever I start receiving spam to a Hide My Email address, I deactivate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently had a "role" Google account terminated because I was (paraphrasing) "violating Google policies" by having multiple accounts. I didn't know they were sticklers about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I don't much care because the account was just used for interacting with somebody else's Google-hosted junk but, if I had been using it for something serious, I have probably been frustrated.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no way, no possible way that Google prohibits the use of multiple accounts. They do not. They cannot. I just asked Gemini and I checked the actual TOS. It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you tools to operate them in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android "user". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated at least two YouTube channels by showing exactly the same ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an "alt account" for misbehavior is not safe. If my "alt account" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But operating multiple accounts is very explicitly supported by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say. I don't know about Apple. Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple "profiles" and "pages" that have unique settings and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently my account "violated TOS" (though I don't see how). The other account was used to interact with a Google Workspace in 2016, and hasn't been used since. I don't particularly care to waste mental energy trying to figure out the methodology behind Google's decision here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This happening seemed kinda sketchy to me (because I've heard of people having several Google accounts) but, like I said, I didn't really care too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's how it went down:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2016 I was working w/ a Customer who was using some Google product (I believe Workspace) and I have to have a Google account to interact w/ it. Because I didn't care for them to see my "personal" Google account I make this one-off account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This account is a Google account w/o Gmail (i.e. the username is not "@gmail.com"). That may be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years I'd receive notifications that Google was going to delete the account for inactivity. I'd logon again to keep it active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 2026-01-12 I got a notification that my old "role" Google account was going to be deleted for being inactive for two years. I decided I wanted to keep it so I attempted to logon. The password in my vault didn't work. I found that perplexing, so I did a "Forgot password" workflow. As part of that I was offered an SMS option. I used the telephone number I use for my main Google account. For sure they "know" I'm the same operator of both accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't believe somebody guessed the password on this account and was using it because (a) I was notified it was inactive, and (b) the password was a random 16 character alphanumeric string used only for this account. Something was clearly sketchy about the password being "wrong", though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I completed the "Forgot password" workflow on the "role" account and got access. I decided to enable TOTP and my "real" Gmail account as the recovery contact. Everything seemed fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 2026-01-13 I received a message as-follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; From: Google &amp;lt;no-reply@accounts.google.com&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; To: MyUsername@NotGmail.example.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Subject: Your Google Account has been disabled&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It looks like this account was created or used with multiple other accounts to violate Google's policies. The account might have been created by a computer program or bot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If you think your account was disabled by mistake, submit an appeal as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Disabled accounts are eventually deleted. You’ll need to submit an appeal soon to keep your emails, contacts, photos, and other data saved in your Google Account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If you live in the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, there may be additional resolution options available to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like an easier solution to having six different email addresses is to use Gmail aliases - I've caught a few less-than-honest companies either selling my email address, or been breached without disclosing such, simply by using an alias along the lines of '+service_name'. If any alias starts to receive spam you can setup rules to automatically delete everything that comes in with that. You also get the added benefit of significantly easier and more accurate search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think y'all understand why I have separate Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use them for different purposes. They are "role accounts" for projects I am doing, such as geneaology and astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to use YouTube sanely, and store different stuff in Drive, I separate them into unique accounts. I use those accounts for specific things, and my YouTube subscriptions, playlists, etc. are tailored for each role, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not about email at all. Obviously, I can access all those email accounts through the one app on my smartphone or the one PWA on my Chromebook. They are easily manageable but separate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also run 3 Outlook/Microsoft accounts, and for the same reason. (One of them is my academic account from community college, and the other two are personal.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't need to give out email addresses for the "role accounts" except where I "Sign In With Google" to various services. So I don't really send/receive email from them at all, except where I'm sharing links or documents with myself (the best way to do this cross-account is still by using email, oftentimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used "MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that "+Echovita" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address. I don't worry about receiving spam anywhere. But like I said, since I've never ever disclosed the addresses of 2-3 of my "alt accounts" they simply never receive any mail at all, spam or no spam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a wildcard acceptance for years, but it doesn’t scale as well something like Apple’s Hide My Email (or other comparable service) - with a catchall you have to then start keeping a blacklist of bad emails, and I started getting spam to generic addresses like info@customdomain.com or admin@customdomain.com - with @icloud.com addresses you can just delete an address and forget about it once it’s burned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have an absurd and overwrought system involving Gmail, and client-side rspamd and SpamSieve on my Mac. Gmail is (was?) overly aggressive flagging things as spam, so I have the client-side Bayesian filter check Gmail’s spam folder and rescue good email, so long as rspamd also says it’s not phishing. And then add sender to a Gmail whitelisting rule. All rescued email is flagged such that if I later manually move any of it back to junk, it stays there as spam and updates the corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now never get good email in the spam folder, and never get undetected spam in the inbox, and very occasionally get a spam erroneously rescued, but still visually flagged as iffy-but-maybe-ham.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Gmail has been lax at filtering spam lately, I haven’t noticed, but perhaps the Bayesian filter has been picking up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should consider this - I run my own domains, and for years I just forwarded it to gmail, but I had so many cases when mails were put into spam, even replies to emails I had sent in the middle of a long conversation between myself and 1 other person, that I went to just self-hosted IMAP. Then for years I couldn't reliably send to google or yahoo or MS; I added SPF a while ago which help, but recently buckled down and put in SRS and DMARC and DKIM (and rspamd while I was at it); now I get the mail I want, and can mostly send mail without it being rejected (still have to ask people to check spam, but anyways many people I have to tell them I'm emailing them anyways if its important). However I have a lot of non-spam "promotion" emails that I don't want to see. If I could train gmail to not block legit stuff reliably, that would be worth trying again (I would say except for the privacy implications, but since so much email involves gmail on one side or the other, they probably get most of it anyways).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple accounts as others have said. The most powerful is to switch to a provider that permits custom domains and allows you to construct topic specific wildcard addresses on the fly. These can't be flagged as invalid or stripped like Google '+' suffixes and when compromised, you can filter them into oblivion and move on to something else. You also get the bonus of having the entire namespace to yourself and can select short addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need an email service provider for that, plenty of DNS providers also offer email forwarding. I can recommend easyDNS, but various others are probably also good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Gmail since the beta (I got invite from a googler) and I don't remember when they began adding spam control but in my experience the GMail spam check works usually exceptionally well: I very rarely need to add a custom filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My email, over two decades+ (2004?), hasn't been in a many public leaks (only one on https://haveibeenpwned.com/ ) but obviously has made its way to various spammy actors but thankfully nearly everything is caught by GMail's spam filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anything I'd say GMail's spam filter works too well: I get more legit emails in my spam folder than spam in my regular inbox. As in: one in a rare while vs about zero spam in my regular inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm having the exact opposite issue. 30+ emails today that clearly belong in spam (fake package delivery, "failed payment for your cloud subscription", etc) have landed in my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's your confirmation, then. It must be either a localized failure to some subgroup of users, or triggered by some combination of settings, if some people are seeing it and others are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been happening for about a month for me. I had to start monitoring spam because legit emails end up there. Funnily enough I started having the opposite problem too - plenty of obvious spam and phishing attempt ending up in my mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have seen a spam button show up I haven't seen in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be a new round of AI training featuring the labour of customers as free employees doing training. Every time we click, we consent to sharing private email data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its really slow. Too slow to use 2FA or in some cases, verify email addresses or recover passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people can't handle a notification on their watch every minute, or several spam every five minutes, so "large numbers of people" are shutting off notifications on their phones. And human nature being what it is, they're not going to be turned back on again. So the era of getting a notification when you get an email is coming to a close. "Important Immediate Attention Stuff" moved to text messages a long time ago anyway, at least for me. The list of technologies you can no longer reach me on, always increases over time...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't understand why spam detection is so complicated. I can tell with high accuracy if an email is spam just by the subject line. I'd think even basic ML could do this very reliably you don't need a bleeding-edge LLM to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phishing is tricker because it can be very deceptive especially if you're being targeted specifically. But also usually pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Are you available? * Paul, can we have a zoom meeting with you on Monday? * Assistance for donation * Greetings!!! * some ideas for you * Refund request * Somethings not working * Manuel Montoya for roof work contractor * proposals for print * Invite Connection&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half of the above are actual spam, half are not. Tell me which is which ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This only applies to spam which requires significant follow-up effort from the spammer to respond to potential victims; effectively just 419 "advance-fee" fraud scams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For spam which only does not require manual effort on the other side, there is no reason to filter out potential victims and all the more reason to make it look as legit as possible to maximize conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; For spam which only does not require manual effort on the other side, there is no reason to filter out potential victims and all the more reason to make it look as legit as possible to maximize conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless there's a trade-off. Saying "respond now or your account will be erased!" doesn't sound very legit. But the number of additional victims the phisher gets by doing probably outweighs the number of more sophisticated victims he loses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Metriport is an open-source data intelligence platform that helps healthcare organizations access and exchange patient data in real-time. We integrate with all major US healthcare IT systems and tap into comprehensive medical data for 300+ million individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We've found product-market fit with multi-million ARR, 100+ customers (including Strive Health, Circle Medical, and Brightside Health), backing from top VCs, and years of runway. We're ready to scale. We're a tight-knit, high-performing team of mostly former founders (including two YC alumni). We're engineering-heavy, operate with minimal bureaucracy and high autonomy, and hire based on competence, not prestige. We push hard—founders work six days a week from our SF office—but give everyone freedom to craft their schedule. We measure output and we're committed to sustainable intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About us&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The following points are an assortment of the most relevant bits that will give you the gist of where we’re at, why we’ll win, and our company culture:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Well funded with a massive recent infusion of capital, found PMF, multi-million ARR, 80+ customers (including Strive Health, Circle Medical, and Brightside Health), funded by top VCs and angels, have years of runway - and we’re just getting started.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We’re a tight-knit, high performing, and passionate team - we work with a consistent intensity and have become a leader in our industry with a fraction of the resources of our competitors.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Consistency means we push as hard as humanly possible, while keeping our health and personal lives in check.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Meaningful work is what gets us out of bed, and we just wouldn’t be satisfied by building yet another CRM company.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;By pedigree, we’re a group of underdogs - we don’t hire based on prestige, but on demonstrated competence and perceived potential.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We’re engineering heavy, and most of our engineers are former founders (including 2 ex-YC founders).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;We operate as a relatively flat structure with little red tape, forced structure, or bureaucracy. We just opt to get shit done and foster a collaborative environment with high autonomy - our GitHub commit history and product velocity is a testament to this.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;The founders set the pace by working 6 days a week in our SF office, but everyone is given full freedom to craft a schedule that’s best for both the team and themselves - team output is measured.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; About you&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, we're looking for a security engineer with the following specific qualities:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You’re entrepreneurial-minded, with an olympian-level work ethic (nearly our entire engineering team consists of former founders).&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You are passionate about security and are excited to own security related projects within the company end-to-end.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You are confident in your ability to build scalable systems across the full stack, and people usually come to you for technical guidance.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You believe you can solve any problem that comes at you, and don't shy away from diving deep into areas where you may lack domain expertise.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You have a strong sense of ownership over your work, and have demonstrated ability to lead others.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You know how to move fast - while still maintaining a strong security posture.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You care more about the end result and delivering value, rather than what new and frilly tech is being used under the hood for a given feature.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;When someone scopes out a project with an ETA of 3 weeks, you ask yourself "why can't it be done in 3 days?".&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;You’re a hacker at heart, and have a good sense of what rules should, and shouldn’t, be broken.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you'll be doing&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After quickly ramping up using our comprehensive onboarding materials to get familiar with our domain, product, and codebase, the goal would be to get you shipping product directly to customers as quickly as possible. Specifically, day to day, this looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Evangelizing security across Metriport’s growing team - we will look to you for guidance, and training.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Driving full-stack security projects , big and small, end-to-end from ideation to production rollout.These projects could include things like: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implement an enterprise-grade audit logging solution for a new national healthcare network infrastructure stack.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implement fine grained RBAC on the API key access layer, and more robust roles on our UIs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Help us revamp our internal security policies and put tools in place to keep the platform, and employees, secure while still allowing the team to be efficient.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Helping the engineering team with PR reviews with a security-focused lens.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Work with the Go to Market team to complete customer security assessments and questionnaires.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Work with the engineering team to harden security across the development lifecycle - think secret management, access controls, and vulnerability scanning.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Managing your own work in Linear.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Participating in bi-weekly sprint planning / retro sessions, and quarterly planning sessions.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Attending a daily 30 minute remote stand-up at 7:30am PST Mon-Fri (our only regular mandatory meeting).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to be taking a look at what almost 13 years of development has done for the Raspberry Pi. I have one of each generation of Pi from the original Pi that was launched in 2012 through to the Pi 5 which was released just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll take a look at what has changed between each generation and how their performance and power consumption has improved by running some tests on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my video of the testing process and results, read on for the write-up;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware Changes Through Each Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the original Raspberry Pi, which was launched in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 SOC which features a single ARM1176JZF-S core running at 700MHz along with a VideoCore IV GPU. It has 512 MB of DDR RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of connectivity, it only has 100Mb networking and 2 x USB 2.0 ports. Video output is 1080P through a full-size HDMI port or analogue video out through a composite video connector and audio output is provided through a 3.5mm audio jack. It doesn’t have any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity but it does have some of the features that we still have on more recent models like DSI and CSI ports, a full size SD card reader for the operating system and GPIO pins, although only 26 of them at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Power is supplied through a micro USB port and it is rated for 5V and 700mA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was priced at $35 – which at the time was incredibly cheap for what was essentially a palm-sized computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 2 was launched 3 years later, in February 2015 and this Pi looked quite different to the original and similar to the Pi’s we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 2 has a significantly better processor than the original. The Broadcom BCM2836 SOC has 4 Cortex-A7 cores running at 900 MHz and it retained the same VideoCore IV GPU. RAM was also bumped up to 1GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It added another 2 x USB 2.0 ports alongside the 100Mb Ethernet port. The composite video port disappeared and the analogue video output was moved into the audio jack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GPIO pins were increased to 40 pins which has followed the same pin layout since – which has really helped in maintaining compatibility with hats and accessories. The SD card reader was also changed to a microSD card reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuitry was bumped up to 800mA to accommodate the more powerful CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 3 was launched just a year later, in February 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 3’s new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC retained the same 4-core architecture but these were changed to 64-bit Cortex A53 cores running at 1.2Ghz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RAM was kept at 1GB but was now DDR2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no change to the USB or Ethernet connectivity on the original Pi 3 but we did see WiFi and Bluetooth added for the first time. WiFi was single band 2.4GHz and we had Bluetooth 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The version that I have is actually the 3B+, which was launched a little later. The main improvements over the original Pi 3 were a 0.2GHz boost to the clock speed and the upgrade to Gigabit networking with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support and dual-band WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuitry was again improved, still running at 5V but now up to 1.34A, which was almost double the Pi 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next came the Pi 4 in June 2019. This Pi came at one of the worst times for global manufacturing and was notoriously difficult to get hold of due to the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Quite ironically, this hard-to-get Pi is the one that I’ve got the most of, mainly due to my water-cooled Pi cluster build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 4 has a Broadcom BCM2711 SOC with 4 Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.5GHz. So again a slight clock speed increase over the Pi 3 but still retaining 4 cores. It also includes a bump up to a VideoCore VI GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the first model to feature different RAM configurations. It was originally available in 1, 2, 4GB variants featuring LPDDR4 RAM and in March of 2020 an 8GB variant was added to the linup as well. This obviously resulted in a few different price points but impressively they still managed to keep a $35 offering 7 years after the launch of the first Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It retained the same form factor as the Pi 3 but with the network and Ethernet ports switched around. Notably, two of the USB ports were upgraded to USB 3.0, networking was now gigabit ethernet like the 3B+, WiFi was dual-band and it had Bluetooth 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also changed the single full-size HDMI port to two micro HDMI ports. Most people I know don’t like this change and find it annoying to have to use adaptors to work with common displays and these micro HDMI ports are prone to breaking when they are used often. I think general hobbyists and makers would prefer this to still be a single full-size port but Pi’s are often used in commercial display applications so I guess that’s why they went with this dual micro HDMI configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuit was actually reduced in this model, from 1.34 down to 1.25A and the port was changed to USB C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raspberry Pi 5&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly and most recently we have the Pi 5 which was launched in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Pi features a Broadcom BCM2712 SOC with 4 Cortex A76 cores running at a significantly faster 2.4Ghz and a VideoCore VII GPU running at 800MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So quite a bump up in CPU and GPU performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is offered in 3 RAM configurations but the drop in a 1GB offering means that they’re no longer available at the $35 price point. There is a fairly significant increase in price up to $50 for the base 2GB variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other notable changes are the inclusion of a PCIe port which enables IO expansion and a much improved power circuit. The PCIe port is quite commonly used to add an NVMe SSD instead of a microSD card for the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The power circuit was upgraded to handle the PCIe port addition, now stepping up to 5V at up to 5A, along with a power button for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change in power supply requirements to 5V and 5A is a bit annoying as most power delivery capable supplies cap out 2.5 or 3A at 5V. It would have been more universal to require a 9V 3A supply to meet the Pis power requirements. I assume they steered away from this because the Pi’s circuitry runs at 5V and 3.3V and they would have then needed to add another onboard DC-DC converter which increases complexity, size and potentially the cost, it would also have made it a bit less efficient. But this does mean that you most likely need to buy a USB C power supply that has been purpose-built for the Pi 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 is also the first Pi to have its own dedicated fan socket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s a summary of the hardware changes, now let’s boot them up and take a look at their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing The Performance Of Each Generation Of Pi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compare the performance between the Pi’s, I’m going to run the following tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I’m going to attempt to playback a 1080P YouTube video in the browser, although I expect we’ll have problems with this up to the Pi 4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’ll then run a Sysbench CPU benchmark which I’ll do both for a single-core and multicore.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then we’ll run a GLMark2 GPU benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then test the storage speed using James Chambers Pi Benchmark script.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then we’ll run an iPerf3 Network Speed test.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lastly, we’ll look at Power Consumption, both at idle and with the CPU maxed out.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And then use that data to determine each Pi’s Performance per Watt.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things as consistent as possible I’m going to be running the latest available version of Pi OS from Raspberry Pi Imager for each Pi. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can still flash an OS image for the original Pi in their latest version of Imager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll be testing them all running on a 32GB Sandisk Ultra microSD card. I’ll also be using an Ice Tower cooler on each to ensure they don’t run anywhere near thermal throttling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1080P YouTube Video Playback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with the original Pi and its first boot and setup process was a lesson in patience. It took me the best part of two hours to get the first boot complete, the Pi updated and the testing utilities installed but I got there in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even once set up it takes about 8 minutes to boot up to the desktop and the CPU stays pegged at 100% for another two to three minutes before dropping down to about 20% at idle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Pi refused to open up the browser, so that’s where my YouTube video playback test ended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 2 managed to open the browser and actually started playing back a 1080P video, which was surprising, but playback was terrible. It dropped pretty much all of the frames both in the window and fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 3 played video back noticeably better than the Pi 2, but it’s still quite a long way away from being usable and still drops a lot of frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 4 handled 1080P video reasonably well. It had some initial trouble but then settled down. Fullscreen is also a bit choppy but is also usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 5 handled 1080P playback well without any significant issues both in the window and fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sysbench CPU Benchmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next was the Sysbench CPU benchmark. I ran three tests on each and averaged the scores and I did this for both single-core and multicore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In single core, the Pi 1 managed a rather dismal score of 68, the Pi 2 got a bit more than double this score but the real step up was with the Pi 3 which managed 18 times higher than the Pi 2. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 also offered good improvements on the previous generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly in multicore, the Pi 3 scored over 18 times the score of the Pi2 and the Pi 4 and 5 provided good improvements on the Pi 3’s score.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the combined multicore score of the Pi 5 to what the single core on the Pi 1 can do, the Pi 5 is a little over 600 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GLmark2 GPU Benchmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I tried running a GLMark2 GPU benchmark on them. I used the GLMark2-es2-wayland version which is designed for OpenGL ES so that the Pi 1 was supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was surprised that the Pi 1 was even able to run GLMark2 – it did complete the benchmark, although the score wasn’t all that impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results really show how the Pi’s GPU has improved in the last two generations. Prior to these tests, I had never seen a score below 100 and the Pi 1, 2 and 3 managed to fall short of triple digits. Pi 5 scored over 2.5 times higher than the Pi 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Storage Speed Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next was the storage speed test using James Chambers Pi Benchmarks script. The bus speed has increased over the years from 25MHz on the Pi 1 to 100MHz on the Pi 5, so I expect we’ll see these reflected in the benchmark scores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage speed test’s results aren’t as dramatic as the CPU and GPU results but show a steady improvement between generations. The Pi 3 did a bit worse than the Pi 2 but this small difference is likely just due to variability in the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;iPerf Network Speed Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I ran the iPerf network speed test on each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi 1 doesn’t quite get close to its theoretical 100Mbps but the Pi 2 does. The Pi 3 B+ although having Gigabit Ethernet is limited by this running over USB 2.0 which only has a theoretical maximum of 300MBps, so it came quite close. Both the Pi 4 and 5 expectedly come close to theoretical Gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Power Consumption Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I tested the power consumption of each Pi at idle and under load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used the same Pi 5 power adaptor to test all of the Pis to keep things consistent and I just used a USB C to micro USB adaptor for the Pi 1, 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idle results were closer than I expected. The Pi 2 had the lowest idle power draw and the Pi 5 the highest, but all were within a watt or two of each other. At full load, you can see the increase in CPU power draw more physical power with the Pi 5 drawing almost three times the Pi 1 and Pi 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Converted to performance per watt using the Sysbench results, we can again see how much better the Pi 4 and 5 are over the Pi 1 and 2. There is a clear improvement in the performance that each generation of Pi is able to get per watt of power, which is essentially its efficiency. Although the Pi 5 draws more power than the Pi 1 under full load, you’re getting almost 200 times more power out of it per watt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts On The Drag Race And Future Pis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed working through this project to see how much Pi’s have changed over the years, particularly in terms of performance. I still remember being amazed at the size and price of the original Pi when it came out and it’s great that they’re still fully supported and can still be used for projects – albeit with less CPU-intensive projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think has been the biggest improvement to the Pi over the years and what you’d still like to see added to future models in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I personally really like the addition of the PCIe port on the Pi 5 and I’d like to see 2.5Gb networking and a DisplayPort or USB C with DisplayPort added to a future generation of Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;BirdyChat becomes the first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 14, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we are excited to share a big milestone. BirdyChat is now the first chat app in Europe that can exchange messages with WhatsApp under the Digital Markets Act. This brings us closer to our mission of giving work conversations a proper home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is currently rolling out interoperability support across Europe. As this rollout continues, the feature will become fully available to both BirdyChat and WhatsApp users in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, you could only message people who already had a BirdyChat account. If someone was not on the app, they had to download it before you could talk. It slowed down adoption and made it harder to move real work conversations into BirdyChat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the new WhatsApp interface mandated by the DMA, any BirdyChat user in the EEA will be able to start a chat with any WhatsApp user in the region simply by knowing their phone number. Your contacts keep using WhatsApp. You stay on BirdyChat. Messages flow both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This removes a big barrier to adopting BirdyChat for work. You no longer need to ask people to switch apps. You can keep work neatly organised in BirdyChat while staying connected to everyone who still relies on WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What interoperability lets you do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interoperability lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start 1:1 chats with WhatsApp users using their phone number&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Send messages, photos and files&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Communicate over an encrypted connection&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use your work email as your identity instead of a personal phone number&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes it much easier to keep work and personal life separate while staying fully reachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the integration works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp introduced Third-Party Chats in Europe earlier this year. BirdyChat connects through this official DMA interface and does not use any workarounds. All communication between BirdyChat and WhatsApp users is end-to-end encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, BirdyChat supports 1:1 chats, with group chat interoperability coming in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature will roll out gradually to BirdyChat users across the European Economic Area. For interoperability to work, both you and your WhatsApp contacts need to be based in the EEA. Since WhatsApp is releasing interoperability as part of a gradual rollout, availability may differ slightly from country to country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get early access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BirdyChat is invite-only while we scale access. Join the waitlist with your work email to be among the first to try WhatsApp interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Productively yours,&lt;lb/&gt;Team BirdyChat&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clarity-1: What Worked, and Where We Go Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On March 14, 2025, Albedo's first satellite, Clarity-1, launched on SpaceX Transporter-13. We took a big swing with our pathfinder. The mission goals:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prove sustainable orbit operations in VLEO — an orbital regime long considered too harsh for commercial satellites — by overcoming thick atmospheric drag, dangerous atomic oxygen, and extreme speeds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prove our mid-size, high-performance Precision bus — designed and built in-house in just over two years.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Capture 10 cm resolution visible imagery and 2-meter thermal infrared imagery, a feat previously achieved only by exquisite, billion dollar government systems.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We proved a ton. We learned a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We achieved the first two goals definitively and validated 98% of the technology required for the third. This was an extraordinarily ambitious first satellite. We designed and built a high-performance bus on time and on budget, integrated a large-aperture telescope, and operated in an environment no commercial company had sustained operations in, funded entirely by private capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the full story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;VLEO Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's start with the result that matters most: VLEO works. And it works better than even we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, Very Low Earth Orbit was written off as impractical for normal satellite lifetimes. The atmosphere is thicker, creating drag that would deorbit normal satellites in weeks. If the drag didn't kill you, atomic oxygen would erode your solar arrays and surfaces. To succeed in VLEO required a fundamentally different satellite design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarity-1 proved that our design works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The drag coefficient was the headline: 12% better than our design target. Measured multiple times at altitudes between 350 km - 380 km with a repeatable result, this validates our models producing a satellite lifespan of five years at 275 km altitude, averaged across the solar cycle. This was one of our most critical assumptions, and we exceeded it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atomic oxygen (AO) is the silent killer in VLEO. The deeper you go, the more AO you encounter. It degrades solar arrays and other traditional satellite materials. We developed a new class of solar arrays with unique measures designed to mitigate AO degradation. They work. Even as we descended deeper into VLEO and AO fluence increased logarithmically, our power generation stayed constant. The solar arrays are holding up as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarity-1 demonstrated over 100 km of controlled altitude descent, stationkeeping in VLEO, and survived a solar storm that temporarily spiked atmospheric density — the impact on Clarity's descent rate was barely noticeable. Momentum management worked. Fault detection worked. Our thrust planning model was validated against GOCE data (a 2009 VLEO R&amp;amp;D mission) with sub-meter accuracy. Radiation tolerance was excellent, with 4x fewer single-event upsets than expected. Orbit determination was dialed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We proved sustainable VLEO operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Precision Bus is Flight-Proven&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developed and built in just over two years, our in-house bus Precision is now TRL-9: flight-proven on-orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every bus subsystem worked. Every piece of in-house technology we developed performed: our CMG steering law, our operational modes, flight and ground software, electronics boards, and our novel thermal management system. We hit our embedded software GNC timing deadlines, we converged our attitude and orbit determination estimators, we saw 4π steradian command and telemetry antenna coverage, and we got on-orbit actuals for our power generation and loads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our cloud-native ground system was incredible. Contact planning across 25 ground stations was completely automated. Mission scheduling updated every 15 minutes to incorporate new tasking and the latest satellite state information, smoothly transitioning to updated on-board command loads with visual tracking of each schedule and its status. Automated thrust planning to achieve our desired orbital trajectory supported 30+ maneuvers per day. Our engineers could track and command the satellite from anywhere with internet and a secure VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We pushed 14 successful flight software feature updates on-orbit — and even executed one FPGA update, which is exceptionally rare. The ability to continuously improve throughout Clarity's operational life proved essential — every major solution to challenges we faced involved flight software updates. On-orbit software upgrades are exceedingly tricky to get right, but Clarity-1 was designed from day one around this foundational capability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Four Weeks of Perfection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first month of the mission was magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An hour after launch, we watched Clarity-1 deploy from the premium caketopper slot into LEO, giving us an incredible view of the Nile River as she separated from the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First contact came just three hours later at 5:11am MT. Imagine sitting in Mission Control, watching two ground station passes with no data, then on the third: heaps of green, healthy telemetry streaming into all of the subsystem dashboards. Clarity had nailed her autonomous boot-up sequence and rocket separation rate capture. Stuck the landing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next milestone — and the one many of us were most anxious about — was our autonomous Protect Mode, basically our VLEO version of Safe Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We estimated a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We nailed it 14 hours after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 6:45pm that same day, Clarity was in Operational mode, ready for commissioning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"Gotta say it: the last 16 hours have been incredible. I started my shift last night hoping to see one bit of data. I wouldn't have believed it if someone told me we'd be in Protect within 14 hours from launch."— Albedo GNC Engineer&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The days that followed were a blur of checkboxes turning green. 4-CMG commissioning complete. Payload power-on and checkout validated. Thermal balance for both visible and thermal sensors confirmed. Our first on-orbit software update went flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarity uses Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) to steer the satellite, giving us more agility than more commonly used reaction wheels. We moved onto validating GNC modes such as GroundTrack, which we use to point at communication ground terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We moved on to commissioning our X-band radio — the high-rate link to downlink imagery. After we uncovered an issue with our ground station provider’s pointing mode, the 800 Mbps link began pumping down data on every pass. The waveforms were clean. Textbook. A direct representation of how locked in our precision CMG pointing was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our first satellite at this level of complexity, we couldn't believe how smoothly it had gone. Years of developing new technologies had been validated in a fraction of the commissioning time we'd anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Maneuvering over 100 km to VLEO&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next up was maneuvering from our LEO drop-off altitude down to VLEO, where it would be safe to eject the telescope contamination cover and start snapping pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then came April 14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of our four CMGs experienced a temperature spike in the flywheel bearing. Our Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) logic caught it immediately, spun it down, and executed automated recovery actions. But it wouldn't spin back up. Manual recovery attempts followed. Also unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rushing back into CMG operations without understanding the failure mechanism risked killing the mission entirely, so we turned off the other three and put the satellite in two-axis stabilization using the magnetic torque rods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had a choice. Hack together novel 3-CMG control algorithms as fast as possible and risk losing another, or figure out how to leverage only the torque rods to achieve 3-axis control with sufficient accuracy to navigate the maneuver to VLEO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We went with the torque rods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On satellites this size (~600 kg), magnetic torque rods are typically used for momentum dumping, not attitude control. But we'd built Clarity with unusually beefy torque rods due to the elevated momentum management needs in VLEO. Our GNC team went heads down and developed algorithms to achieve 3-axis attitude control using only torque rods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within a month, we had it working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of our electric thrusters commissioned quickly and were working well. But with torque rods only, our attitude control had 15 to 20 degrees of error, sometimes reaching ~45 degrees. And maneuvering to VLEO isn’t “point into the wind and fire” — it’s continuous vector and trajectory management across an orbit. That kind of control error meant inefficient burns and a much harder descent plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the descent progressed, however, the team learned and iterated. With more iteration and flight software updates, we uploaded onboard logic informed by several sources of live data that dialed in our thrust vector control to within 5 degrees of the target. The autonomous thrust planning system we built enabled us to claw back performance that nearly matched our originally projected descent speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We maneuvered safely past the ISS and entered VLEO. Eager to pop off the contamination cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Lens Cap Jettison&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we reached safe altitude, it was time to jettison the contamination cover protecting our telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are horror stories about contamination covers getting stuck after months of temperature fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarity's was flawless. I'll never forget seeing this blip in telemetry live — confirming through Newton's third law that the jettison was successful. Shortly after, LeoLabs confirmed tracking of two separate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were ready to start imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Imaging Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's where it got complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our GNC and FSW teams were close but not yet finished with the new 3-CMG control law. CMGs are rarely used in commercial space, let alone by a startup. Then take one more step: singularity-prone 3-CMG control that to our knowledge has not been attempted on a non-exquisite satellite, and certainly not developed and uploaded on-orbit. Traditional algorithms require at least four CMGs to provide capability volumes free of singularities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were eager to make some amount of progress, so we started imaging on torque rods even though there would be severe limitations: 50+ pixels of smear, large mispointing from the wobble of torque rod control due to earth's magnetic field, and downlink limited to at best two small images per day. The last two constraints meant we were at risk of spending precious downlink capacity on clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the first two days of pixels were mostly clouds, but we were happy to peek through a little in this image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although we couldn't control attitude accurately, we did still have good attitude knowledge after the fact. AyJay whipped up a clever idea with Claude Code that automated posting weather conditions in Slack for each collection. We analyzed that to determine which images were likely clear, and selected those for downlink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boom:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We adjusted the focus position a few times, and images continued getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, 3-CMG control was ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the box, the new algorithms and software performed perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This visualization shows real telemetry of Clarity performing seven back-to-back imaging maneuvers, with limited 3-CMG agility, followed by an X-band downlink over Iceland minutes later. The satellite was executing sophisticated attitude profiles with very low control error. Fiber-optic gyro measurements showed exquisite jitter performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real time, collecting and downlinking those seven images took ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is where our ground software really showed its teeth. On most missions, “data on the ground” is just the start — turning raw bits into something viewable is a slow chain of handoffs and batch processing. For us, within seconds of the downlink finishing, the image product pipeline was already posting processed snippets into our company Slack. Literally seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That end-to-end loop — photons in orbit to a viewable product on the ground, within minutes — is a capability that’s still rare in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As expected with smear reduced, image quality improved immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were ready to execute focus calibration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large telescope optics experience hygroscopic dryout during the first few months on-orbit — moisture trapped in materials during ground assembly slowly releases in the vacuum of space, causing the focus position to drift. Dialing in best focus requires dozens of iterations: capture images, analyze sharpness, adjust focus position, repeat. Each cycle gets you closer to the optical performance the system was designed for, and our telescope’s on-ground alignment was verified to spec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We continued to iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a few iterations of this, we could start to see cars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even this early into imaging, the infrared images blew us away. Using a low-cost microbolometer — a fraction of the price of cooled IR sensors — we captured thermal signatures that showed ships in Tokyo Bay, steel processing facilities where we could distinguish individual coke ovens from their smokestacks, and distinct signatures between real vegetation and turf — a good proxy for camouflage detection. Day or night, clear as day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three days into the excitement, CMG problems started again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second CMG began showing the same telemetry signatures we now recognized as warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we had learned from the investigation: the allowable temperature specifications of the CMGs were much higher than the true limit, constrained by what the lubricant inside the flywheel could handle. A straightforward fix for the future — an unfortunate corner case to learn about in hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second CMG showing issues was also on the hot side of the satellite. While we had overhauled the vehicle and CMG operations to prevent additional bearing wear, the damage had already been done in the first month of the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We spent months trying everything we could to get the CMGs to operate sustainably. The team attempted many clever solutions, one of which revived the first CMG that had locked up. We uploaded a feature to select any 3 of the 4 CMGs for operator commanding. But we weren't able to get sustained, reliable operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the CMG challenges, here's what the imaging journey proved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full end-to-end image chain works. Photons hit our optics, get captured by our sensor, processed through payload electronics, packetized and encrypted, transmitted via our X-band radio, received on the ground, and processed into image products. The entire chain is validated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end-to-end loop is fast. Within 30 seconds of a downlink, processed image snippets were already posting to our company Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sensor performance exceeded expectations. Dynamic range, radiometry, color balance, band-to-band alignment — all look great, even on uncalibrated imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can scan out long images. Our line-scanning approach produced strips 20-30 kilometers long, exactly as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pointing accuracy and high quality telemetry validates the ingredients for precise geolocation. The data we need to pinpoint where each pixel lands on Earth to &amp;lt;5m (closed-loop CE90) is there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jitter and smear are low. Fiber-optic gyro measurements confirmed 3x lower smear and 11x lower jitter compared to our goal — a critical ingredient for exquisite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our proprietary image scheduler works. The automated system that plans collections, manages constraints, and optimizes what we capture each day performed as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where Clarity Is Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nine months into the mission, we lost contact with Clarity-1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By that point, we had largely exhausted our options on the CMGs. The path to further image quality improvement had effectively closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had been tracking intermittent memory issues in our TT&amp;amp;C radio throughout the mission, working around them as they appeared. Our best theory is that one of these issues escalated in a way that corrupted onboard memory and is preventing reboots. We've tried several recovery approaches. So far, none have worked, and the likelihood of recovery looks low at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what matters: the VLEO validation data we collected is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We combined a state-of-the-art atmospheric density model, our high-fidelity orbital dynamics force models, and months of natural orbit decay data from 350 to 380 km altitude to determine Clarity’s coefficient of drag — with repeatable results at different altitudes. That drag coefficient, paired with our demonstrated ability to maintain altitude in VLEO for months using high-efficiency thrusters, tells us exactly how the vehicle behaves under aerodynamic drag across the VLEO regime — and validates an average five-year lifespan at 275 km across the solar cycle. Telemetry from our solar arrays, together with onboard atomic oxygen sensor data, shows peak power generation stayed constant after exposure to VLEO levels of AO fluence — proving our AO mitigation worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to our friends at LeoLabs, we've validated that Clarity is maintaining attitude autonomously. She's still up there, still oriented, still descending through VLEO. Just not talking to us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even before this, we had started developing an in-house TT&amp;amp;C radio for our systems moving forward, rather than reusing this radio that was procured from a third party. We’ll incorporate learnings from this reliability issue into that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're still working the problem. This chapter isn't over yet. But even if it is, Clarity-1 gave us what we needed to build what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;98% of The 10 cm Imagery Pyramid&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think about exquisite imagery as a pyramid, we needed 100% of the systems working together to achieve the pinnacle: 10 cm visible imagery. We got to about 98%. Everything else in that pyramid — the entire foundation — is proven and retired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our drag coefficient. Our atomic oxygen resilience. Our solar arrays. Our thermal management. Our flight software. Our ground software. Our CMG steering laws. Our precision pointing algorithms. Our payload electronics. Our sensor performance. Our image processing chain. Our ability to operate sustainably in VLEO. Our team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All validated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know exactly what to fix. It’s straight forward: operate the CMGs at lower temperature. The system thermal design is already updated in the next build to maximize CMG life going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the CMGs, there were a handful of learnings on the margins. We learned our secondary mirror structure could be stiffer — already in the updated design. We learned we could use more heater capacity in some payload zones — already fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We learned from the things that worked, too. We're well down the development path for next-gen flight software, avionics, and power distribution. Orbit determination and geolocation will be even better. Additional surface treatments will improve drag coefficient further. Power-generation will increase while maintaining the proven atomic oxygen resilience. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The path to exquisite imagery is clear. And that’s only one of many exciting capabilities unlocked by sustainable operations in VLEO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What’s Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our next VLEO mission will incorporate these learnings and demonstrate new features that enable missions beyond imaging — we’ll share more details soon. In parallel, imaging remains a core focus: we’re continuing to build optical payloads for EO/IR missions as part of a broader VLEO roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The successes of Clarity-1 reinforced our core conviction: VLEO isn’t just a better orbit for imaging — it’s the next productive orbital layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The physics are unforgiving, but that’s exactly why it matters. Go lower and you unlock a step-change in performance: sharper sensing, faster links, lower latency, and a new level of responsiveness. The reason VLEO has been written off for decades isn’t lack of upside — it’s that most satellites simply can’t survive there long enough to matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we know they can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarity proved the hard parts: sustainable VLEO operations, validated drag and lifetime models, atomic oxygen resilience, and a flight-proven high-performance bus. We’re not speculating about VLEO. We’re operating in it, learning in it, and capitalized to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Onward,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog&lt;/head&gt;Published on&lt;p&gt;You can now view replies to this blog post made on Bluesky directly on this website. Check it out here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always wanted to host a comment section on my site, but it's difficult because the content is statically generated and hosted on a CDN. I could host comments on a separate VPS or cloud service. But maintaining a dynamic web service like this can be expensive and time-consuming — in general, I'm not interested in being an unpaid, part-time DevOps engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, however, I read a blog post by Cory Zue about how he embedded a comment section from Bluesky on his blog. I immediately understood to benefits of this approach. With this approach, Bluesky could handle all of the difficult work involved in managing a social media like account verification, hosting, storage, spam, and moderation. Meanwhile because Bluesky is an open platform with a public API, it's easy to directly embed comments on my own site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other services that could be used for this purpose instead. Notably, I could embed replies from the social media formerly known as Twitter. Or I could use a platform like Disqus or even giscus, which hosts comments on GitHub Discussions. But I see Bluesky as a clearly superior choice among these options. For one, Bluesky is built on top of an open social media platform in AT Proto, meaning it can't easily be taken over by an authoritarian billionaire creep. Moreover, Bluesky is a full-fledged social media platform, which naturally makes it a better option for hosting a conversation than GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zue published a standalone package called bluesky-comments that allows embedding comments in a React component as he did. But I decided to build this feature myself instead. Mainly this is because I wanted to make a few styling changes anyway to match the rest of my site. But I also wanted to leave the option open to adding more features in the future, which would be easier to do if I wrote the code myself. The entire implementation is small regardless, amounting to only ~200 LOC between the UI components and API functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I planned to allow people to directly post on Bluesky via my site. This would work by providing an OAuth flow that gives my site permission to post on Bluesky on behalf of the user. I actually did get the auth flow working, but building out a UI for posting and replying to existing comments is difficult to do well. Going down this path quickly leads to building what is essentially a custom Bluesky client, which I didn't have the time or interest in doing right now. Moreover, because the user needs to go through the auth flow and sign-in to their Bluesky account, the process is not really much easier than posting directly on a linked Bluesky post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the requirement of allowing others to directly post on my site, the implementation became much simpler. Essentially, my task was to specify a Bluesky post that corresponds to the article in the site's metadata. Then, when the page loads I fetch the replies to that post from Bluesky, parse the response, and display the results in a simple comment section UI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As explained in my last post, this site is built using React Server Components and Parcel. The content of my articles are written using MDX, an extension to Markdown that allows directly embedding JavaScript and JSX. In each post, I export a &lt;code&gt;metadata&lt;/code&gt; object that I validate using a Zod schema. For instance, the metadata for this post looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of &lt;code&gt;bskyPostId&lt;/code&gt; references the Bluesky post from which I'll pull replies to display in the comment section. Because my project is built in TypeScript, it was easy to integrate with the Bluesky TypeScript SDK (&lt;code&gt;@bluesky/api&lt;/code&gt; on NPM). Reading the Bluesky API documentation and Zue's implementation led me to the &lt;code&gt;getPostThread&lt;/code&gt; endpoint. Given an AT Protocol URI, this endpoint returns an object with data on the given post and its replies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could have interacted directly with the Bluesky API from my React component using &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;. However, it can be a bit tricky to correctly handle loading and a error states, even for a simple feature like this. Because of this, I decided to use the Tanstack &lt;code&gt;react-query&lt;/code&gt; package to manage the API request/response cycle. This library takes care of the messy work of handling errors, retries, and loading states while I simply provide it a function to fetch the post data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I obtain the Bluesky response, the next task is parsing out the content and metadata for the replies. Bluesky supports a rich content structure in its posts for representing markup, references, and attachments. Building out a UI that fully respects this rich content would be difficult. Instead, I decided to keep it simple by just pulling out the text content from each reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, building a UI that properly displays threaded comments, particularly one that is formatted well on small mobile devices, can be tricky. For now, my approach was to again keep it simple. I indented each reply and added a left border to make it easier to follow reply threads. Otherwise, I mostly copied design elements for layout of the profile picture and post date from Bluesky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I added a UI component linking to the parent post on Bluesky, and encouraging people to add to the conversation there. With this, the read-only comment section implementation was complete. If there's interest, I could publish my version of Bluesky comments as a standalone package. But several of the choices I made were relatively specific to my own site. Moreover, the implementation is simple enough that others could probably build their own version from reading the source code, just as I did using Zue's version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think by replying on Bluesky. Hopefully this can help increase engagement with my blog posts, but then again, my last article generated no replies, so maybe not 😭.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Researchers on Friday said that Poland’s electric grid was targeted by wiper malware, likely unleashed by Russia state hackers, in an attempt to disrupt electricity delivery operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cyberattack, Reuters reported, occurred during the last week of December. The news organization said it was aimed at disrupting communications between renewable installations and the power distribution operators but failed for reasons not explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wipers R Us&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Friday, security firm ESET said the malware responsible was a wiper, a type of malware that permanently erases code and data stored on servers with the goal of destroying operations completely. After studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack, company researchers said the wiper was likely the work of a Russian government hacker group tracked under the name Sandworm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Based on our analysis of the malware and associated TTPs, we attribute the attack to the Russia-aligned Sandworm APT with medium confidence due to a strong overlap with numerous previous Sandworm wiper activity we analyzed,” said ESET researchers. “We’re not aware of any successful disruption occurring as a result of this attack.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandworm has a long history of destructive attacks waged on behalf of the Kremlin and aimed at adversaries. Most notable was one in Ukraine in December 2015. It left roughly 230,000 people without electricity for about six hours during one of the coldest months of the year. The hackers used general purpose malware known as BlackEnergy to penetrate power companies’ supervisory control and data acquisition systems and, from there, activate legitimate functionality to stop electricity distribution. The incident was the first known malware-facilitated blackout.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We X-Rayed A Suspicious FTDI USB Cable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recently got an industrial X-Ray machine in the Eclypsium office to use to &lt;del&gt;make the next Doctor Manhattan&lt;/del&gt; do serious cybersecurity research. In between X-raying yet-to-be released industrial IT technologies on behalf of giant companies whose names we cannot reveal, we have done some other fun experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing we’ve done with it so far was to x-ray some FTDI USB to UART cables. We had an old cable lying around that seemed a little suspicious and dysfunctional. It worked at slow speeds but it failed when transferring firmware images from a product. These failures drove us to purchase the known good cables from DigiKey, which worked as expected. It is possible that this older cable came from a factory which also produced older generations of authentic FTDI cables, but this particular chip didn’t meet the performance requirements for the FTDI brand. Or maybe it was just a production run based on stolen FTDI IP. Or it is actually completely unrelated to any FTDI IC but has been programmed to claim to be FTDI in software. Unless we could match the silicon exactly to a known supply chain, we can really only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In either case, we wanted to see the difference between the suspicious cable and a newer, more obviously “legit” one that cost about $20 from DigiKey. It is not a stretch to assume that a suspicious looking cable is a counterfeit. FTDI has publicly announced issues with counterfeit devices. They have even fought back with drivers which brick counterfeit chips. Some people have even referred to this as vendor sanctioned malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the two cables look like to the naked eye:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a look at the two x-ray images below and see if you can tell which one is suspicious, and which one is authentic. Then scroll down and we’ll tell you what we see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we tell you the answer, here are some clues to look out for in each picture. The authentic cable has the following features visible in the X-Ray image, not shared with the suspicious cable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ground pours (reduces impedance and ground loops while improving EMI resistance and thermal dissipation). While there is some debate about the actual value of copper ground pours, they are still used by reputable manufacturers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ground stapling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decoupling passives nearer to the main integrated circuit (IC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More isolation passives for USB data pins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Thermal pad under IC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Engineered strain relief for wire connections&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More solder for mechanical tabs on USB A connector&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smaller/newer silicon process&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better passive alignment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Big Reveal, and the Implications for Supply Chain Security&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, the top image above is the authentic cable. The bottom image is the more questionable one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you get it right? If not, go back and see if you can pinpoint the various clues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is that, even when you know what to look for, spotting a counterfeit isn’t necessarily easy. The consequences for a consumer buying a shady USB cable likely aren’t too bad. But what happens when an enterprise gets counterfeit network gear with a backdoor pre-installed? Or when a major bank receives grey market servers with another company’s data on them? Eclypsium has helped major worldwide organizations discover exactly these types of supply chain issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supply chain risk is growing rapidly. As AI data center projects capture more and more of the global supply for chips, memory, storage, and other key resources, the secondary market for all of these is heating up. The speed and complexity of these supply chains leaves gaps that cyber adversaries can exploit to introduce vulnerable components and backdoors into tech that makes its way into critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Living under rocks#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As anyone that hasn’t been living under a rock might have heard, AI accelerators are the coolest kids in town these days. And although I have never been part of the “in” crowd, this time at least, I get the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when the opportunity arose to join an experimental shuttle using global foundries 180nm for FREE I jumped onto the opportunity and designed my own JTAG!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sorry? Is this not what you were expecting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frankly, I would love to tell you a great story about how I went into this wanting to design a free and open source silicon proven AI accelerator that the community could freely extend and re-use in their own projects. But in truth this project started out first as me wanting to design some far less sexy, in-silicon debug infrastructure and only later came to include the systolic matrix matrix multiplication accelerator … to serve as the design under test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No wonder I was never one of the cool kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, I’m designing everything from scratch and have only two weeks left, welcome to the crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Experimental shuttle#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again this tapeout was done as part of a Tiny Tapeout shuttle, but this time, it went out as not part of a public but an experimental shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These experimental shuttles are used as testing grounds for new nodes and flows in order to iron out issues before they are opened to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participation in these experimental shuttles is commonly reserved to contributors having previously submitted to Tiny Tapeout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This limitation was set in place in order to help select for veteran designers as these experimental tapeout typically have less stable tooling and the final chip doesn’t feature the same level of inter design isolation as in a public tapeout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contributions to these shuttles are done with the understanding that the resulting chip might not be functional for some reason outside of the designers control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given these limitations, the Tiny Tapeout program is generously making submissions to these shuttles free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, this makes area effectively free, explaining the higher occurrence of absolutely massive designs being submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the final chip is deemed sufficiently functional, the resulting ASICs along with the dev board will be available for purchase at the Tiny Tapeout store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given you need to have taped out a chip with Tiny Tapeout before to be eligible, I became eligible 14 days before the experimental shuttle submission deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Combo#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we start, let us acknowledge what I am attempting to do, alone.&lt;lb/&gt;If this were any normal corporate setting, it would be the deadline equivalent to a one way ticket straight to the ever-lengthening queue outside the gates of Hell.&lt;lb/&gt;Do not try this at work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that safety precautions are out of the way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to a tale of two designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first, is the systolic array, typically found at the heart of any AI inference accelerator, its function is to perform matrix-matrix multiplications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other is our silicon debug infrastructure, namely the all ubiquitous JTAG TAP component. Its goal is to provide something to latch onto when my ASIC comes back as an expensive brick and I am frantically trying to figure out where I fucked up. Given I wish to trust it not to be broken, having something that is proven early is very important since my masterplan is to slap it on all my future tapeouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Project Roadmap#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, I have to admit something: &lt;del&gt;I embellished reality in order to make myself look good&lt;/del&gt; I lied. Although initially I had 2 weeks to do this tapeout, because I spent the first 4 days reeling from the after effects of my previous tapeout (aka: sleeping, going outside and talking to another human being) and “deciding on a technical direction” which is corporate speech for describing a mixture between “procrastinating” and “figuring out what I could build without sacrificing too much of my remaining sanity”, I now had 10 days left. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given my self-imposed dire straits of a timeline, if I wanted to have any hope whatsoever of meeting the tapeout deadline I needed a battle plan: here is the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;--- config: logLevel: 'debug' theme: 'default' gitGraph: showBranches: true mainBranchName: 'architecture' mainBranchOrder: 6 --- gitGraph TB: commit id: "idea " commit id: "figured it out " branch design order: 4 checkout design commit id: 'basic RTL ' branch simulation order: 5 checkout simulation commit id: 'this RTL is broken ' checkout design commit id: 'starts to work ' branch implementation order: 3 checkout implementation commit id: 'RIP timing ' commit id: 'RIP area ' checkout design commit id: 'looking good ' branch emulation order: 2 checkout emulation commit id: 'bitstream acquired ' branch firmware commit id: 'firmware bringup ' checkout emulation merge firmware checkout design merge emulation merge simulation checkout implementation merge design commit id: 'tapeout! '&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;architecture: what I need to build and how components would interface with one another.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;design: where most of the RTL design takes place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;simulation: I write tests for simulating and validating that my design is behaving correctly and without any identifiable bugs. I used the classic Cocotb wrapper around iverilog for this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FPGA emulation: when the design has mostly taken shape is when emulation takes place. This is the step where I port the design to an FPGA.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;firmware: Alongside the emulation I bring up the firmware to interface with my design. This allows me to validate there are no issues when interfacing between the MCU and the ASIC.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implementation: this is when the ASIC flow is run and is the longest running task. It starts being run when the RTL design starts becoming functional to identify and fix timing and area utilization issues. And once all the verification is finished, it is run one final time to generate the final ASIC GDSII (manufacturing files).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most astute readers might have noticed that this grand strategy is pretty much the same roadmap I always use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If it aint broken dont fix it. ~ a wise man&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flow saves the day#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, why am I doing this to myself? Well, self delusion is a powerful force, and it was telling me this timeline would be possible if I leveraged my previous experience with the Tiny Tapeout/Librelane/OpenROAD flows, my existing personal linting/simulation/fpga/firmware flows, my existing code bases, and my own &lt;del&gt;ingrained knowledge of the dark arts&lt;/del&gt; experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, let us not delude ourselves, the saving grace of this terrible idea was really just how great the Tiny Tapeout/Librelane/OpenROAD ASIC flow is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following section assumes readers are already familiar with the Open Source Silicon ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those not already familiar with Tiny Tapeout, Librelane and OpenROAD, you can find a short description of these in my previous hashing accelerator ASIC article, where I introduce some of the great tools that the open source silicon ecosystem has created.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenROAD project was conceived with a no-human-in-the-loop (NHIL) target, and the goal of enabling 24-hour-or-less design turnaround times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Librelane, the master coordinator of the flow itself, brings together OpenROAD, Yoysy, ABC, Magic, and many more amazing open source tools, building on top of this philosophy. Creating a process that takes you from your verilog and a few configurations all the way to the tapeout ready artifacts, in an extremely streamlined and fast fashion, requiring minimal human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tiny Tapeout then completes the loop, running your testbenches on top of the entire implementation, and then allowing you to automatically upload your GDSII for integration into the shuttle chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This deeply resonates with my personal beliefs that faster iteration times are central to higher quality and more efficient design :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I believe a low iteration time is paramount to project velocity and getting big things done, I also want to automatize all of the Vivado flow from taking the rtl to the SVF generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;~ Previous article: Alibaba cloud FPGA: the 200$ Kintex UltraScale+&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, not only was I building on top of a legacy of efficient design flows, but I had previously &lt;del&gt;spent&lt;/del&gt; invested a lot of time streamlining my tasks, especially repetitive ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A classic example would be my FPGA build flow used for emulation. It only requires a single command to create the Vivado project, read all the rtl and constraint files, synthesize, optionally add an ILA core and connect any wires marked for debug to it, implement, and then flash the bitstream :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make fpga_prog debug=1  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially, the bottleneck to making this design, from scratch in 10 days, wasn’t going to be the tools, but the squishy human between the chair and the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s talk design !&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Systolic Array Design#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal of this systolic array is to perform a 2×2 matrix-matrix multiply on 8-bit integer numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without going too much into detail on why systolic arrays are the recurring stars at the heart of modern AI inference accelerators, their main strength is achieving a high ratio of compute to everything else. And since memory operations are the most expensive family of operations by far, a hh ratio of compute to memory operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data is recirculated directly within the array and reused across multiple consecutive operations rather than being repeatedly fetched/written from/to memory. This matters because memory accesses are expensive. SRAM accesses cost time and significant power, while DRAM accesses cost eternities of time and egregious amounts of power. Compute operations, even 64 bit floating point multiplications, are by comparison, cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the larger the systolic array, the deeper the chain of compute, the better this compute to memory ratio becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Energy ratio#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an illustrative example of this evolution of compute ratios, let us compare the power cost of 64 bit floating point multiply-add (MAC) operations in a hypothetical systolic array designed on a 45nm node running at 0.9V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared with the energy expenditure needed to access this data using 256 bit wide reads to the 16nm DRAM. DRAM access costs will include the 10mm of wire, interface and access costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, we will very generously assume the weights are stored in place and do not need to be updated, so will assume only the input data matrix needs to be read from DRAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Operation&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;45 nm&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;2,048 pJ&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;source: ENERGY PROPORTIONAL MEMORY SYSTEMS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I purposefully chose 64 bit floats, the most energy intensive arithmetic operation, we still required a 64x64 systolic array before the cost of compute started exceeding the cost of the initial DRAM value reads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;aka: For those not living in 2026, we have uncovered a new clue to the mystery of where all the low-power DRAM chips have suddenly vanished to!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Scaling#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another great feature of systolic arrays is how regular they are and how well their design scales. So, although today I am designing a small 2x2 array, without much re-work this can be scaled up to a larger 256x256 array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of you might be wondering: if area is free and systolic arrays scale so well, why am I limiting myself to only making a 2x2 array ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, because I am a good neighbor and any additional tile of area I use is potentially depriving someone else from having the area available to submit their project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the initial motivation for this project was to design some proven in silicon debug infrastructure, a 2x2 array is sufficient for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Constraints#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this ASIC is once again taping out as part of a Tiny Tapeout shuttle, it has to grapple with the similar limitations as my previous hashing accelerator, namely: the eternal I/O bandwidth limitation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This limitations comes in two flavors:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pin count: eight input pins, eight output pins, and eight configurable I/O pins, limiting my parallel buses in and out of the accelerator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum operating frequency: unlike with the well-trodden path that was the public Skywater 130nm shuttle tapeout, for this experimental shuttle the maximum switching frequency of these pins hasn’t been characterized yet. And since I haven’t yet figured out how to do this characterization using a simulator myself, I’ve hand-wavingly assumed that both the input and output directions have a sustainable switching frequency of 50 MHz, and have sized the path timings around that assumption.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, I once again have the constraint of not having any SRAM. Though unlike with the Skywater 130 tapeout, the GlobalFoundries 180nm PDK does include a proven SRAM macro!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hooray! Human progress is unstoppable !&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, the limitation was actually imposed by the experimental nature of this shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, the flow didn’t initially support these macros out of the box. More specifically in the way they were laid out, which led to a slew of DRC failures that needed to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, this experimental shuttle didn’t provide individual project power gating. As such, integrating this SRAM macro was commonly deemed not the best idea, and the community collectively agreed to wait for a future shuttle, which would include per-project macro power gating, before including it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Design Details#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system is broken into two parts :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the compute units&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the main array controller&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compute units#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this is a 2×2 systolic array, there are four compute units. Each unit takes in an 8 bit signed integer and performs a multiply, addition, and a clamping operation, producing 8 bit signed integers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Multiplication#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The multiply is done using a custom (from scratch) implementation of a Booth Radix-4 multiplier with Wallace trees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This multiplier architecture strikes a good balance between area, power and performance, and can be regarded as the multiplier equivalent of what “Rental White™"[1] is to interior design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meaning it is a solid, well rounded from a PPA’s perspective, multiplier option, that without being anything novel or groundbreaking, is probably good enough for your use case (and given my +2ns of worst negative slack, and comfortable area occupancy, it was plenty good enough for mine).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another advantage of booth radix-4 is that, since we are performing a signed multiplication, we can optimize out a level in the Wallace tree we are using for the partial product additions given we only have 4 partial products, unlike the 5 needed for unsigned operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original article plan included an in-depth explanation of the booth radix-4 multiplication implementation and optimization, resulting in a very interesting but also very dry multi-page explanation covered with boolean algebra. Resulting in its canning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a good explanation of this multiplier and its optimization see chapter 11 of ‘CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Clamping#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The clamping operation occurs after both the multiply and addition operations. At which point the data is now 17 bit wide, and since we want to prevent our data size from exploding, the clamping operation is needed to clamp the outgoing data back down to eight bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$$ clamp_{i8}(x) = \begin{cases} \phantom{-}127,\,\text{if}\,x &amp;gt; 127, \\ \phantom{-12}x,\,\text{if}\,x \in [-128,127], \\ -128,\,\text{if}\,x &amp;lt; -128 \end{cases} $$&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;In place weight storage#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that the weights have high temporal and spatial locality, meaning the same set of weights can be reused over multiple unique input data matrices, in order to save on bandwidth, the choice was made to store an 8 bit weight in place inside of each unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A separate control sequence allows the user to load a new set of weights inside each of the units. The weight packet is sent over four consecutive cycles using the same input interface as the data matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Array controller#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the way in which the matrix matrix multiplication is performed using a systolic array, the input data matrix needs to be shaped and fed to the array in a staggered manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understandably readers might not instinctively get what I mean by “the data needs to be shaped”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to help better illustrate this point, I would like to bring your attention to a great animation to show how data flows through the array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An added bonus is that this animation is also of a 2×2 systolic array, such that it shares the same data with the same arrival constraints as my accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This animation is not a carbon copy of my accelerator. Rather, readers should use this animation as a tool to better understand how data flows in a systolic array and how it results in the computation of a matrix-matrix multiplication. For the sake of completeness, I would like to point out the major differences with my implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;this animation uses floating-point numbers, I am using 8-bit integers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;there is no clamping step&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the timings are not entirely identical. In my accelerator, many more operations occur on the same cycle. Granted, this was probably done in an effort to help make the animation more legible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to helping shape the input data to the systolic array, this controller also helps coordinate data transfers around my I/O limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the parallel data bus allows only 8 bits of input data to arrive per cycle, it is used to control the input buffers in order to accumulate enough data to create the next wave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly on the output side, when the accelerator produces two 8-bit results per cycle, the controller stores the results in an output buffer in order to only stream out 8 bits per cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Validation#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Validation was an extremely important step for this systolic array, particularly for validating my custom implementation of the Booth Radix-4 multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, I used Cocotb as the abstracting layer allowing me to interface with multiple different simulators. Namely, icarus verilog for my standard verification and CVC for the post implementation timing annotated netlist.&lt;lb/&gt;This validation followed my standard approach of providing a set of input data matrices and weights over the standard accelerators interfaces and comparing the produced results to the expected values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the nature of the problem, I made extensive use of randomization in order to get better testing coverage and attempt to hit corner cases that would not have been revealed using a directed approach. This randomization randomized both the values of the inputs weight and data, and also the timings with which this incoming data was fed over the parallel bus to the accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Firmware#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The firmware used to interface with this accelerator was designed to run on the RP2040 Raspberry Pi silicon and used the PIO hardware block to drive the parallel port.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I followed a similar approach as with my hashing accelerator, co-designing with the PIO imposed limitation when designing the parallel bus protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although this was designed for an RP2040, I later learned that the Tiny Tapeout boards would be evolving to a new version of the chip. These new PCBs would use a different pinout layout for communicating with the ASIC chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although this will necessitate to re-adapt parts of the firmware for the new dev boards, this shouldn’t cause any major incompatibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JTAG TAP Design#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second major component of this design and admittedly the actual principle piece of this ASIC is the JTAG TAP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As stated earlier when my ASIC comes back as a glorified paperweight I will suddenly have a strong and immediate need for some kind of hardware block providing some in-silicon observability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is absolutely crucial, as it isn’t a question of if but when one of my ASIC will have hardware issues.&lt;lb/&gt;And, when that day comes, not having a view of the internal behavior will only make it that much more painful to identify the root issue in order to fix it for the upcoming generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, this TAP is actually a part of my larger efforts to help produce a set of DFT (Design for Test) proven IPs/tools that I can integrate into all of my future ASICs. As such, I have quite an incentive to have these designs proven early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JTAG was chosen as it is a very common debug protocol. Not only is it well-defined but has good off-the-shelf support, both on the hardware (debug probes) and software side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JTAG Implementation#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to implementing all of the basic JTAG features in order to be compliant with the protocol, I additionally added custom instructions, extending it to fit my personal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Required instructions :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;EXTEST&lt;/code&gt;, opcode&lt;code&gt;0x0&lt;/code&gt;, boundary scan operation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;IDCODE&lt;/code&gt;, opcode&lt;code&gt;0x1&lt;/code&gt;, read JTAG tap identifiers, which allows the hardware to advertise itself on the JTAG scan chain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SAMPLE_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt;, opcode&lt;code&gt;0x2&lt;/code&gt;, boundary scan operation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;BYPASS&lt;/code&gt;, opcode&lt;code&gt;0x7&lt;/code&gt;, set the TAP in bypass mode&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom instructions :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;USER_REG&lt;/code&gt;, opcode&lt;code&gt;0x3&lt;/code&gt;, custom instruction used to probe the internal registers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The systolic array is quite a deep structure in the sense that the data is directly reused as it is recirculated within the array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, it is very easy to lose track of what the internal state is, having only the input and output observable to the user. Although this might stay manageable with a 2 x 2 array. As the structure grows larger, this will start to become more and more of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to help address this future pain point, I added the custom &lt;code&gt;USER_REG&lt;/code&gt; JTAG
instruction to read the current state of a target compute units internal registers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Link to the datasheet of the &lt;code&gt;USER_REG&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Design#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JTAG TAP design itself is quite straightforward as JTAG was conceived as a hardware first protocol, and this shows in its implementation. The design clearly flows from the JTAG specification to the RTL (unlike you BLAKE2 I am looking at you!). As such I do not think it is worthwhile to discuss it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this design more interesting is how the JTAG and the systolic array live in two different clock domains. Making this accelerator have not one but two separate clock trees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the altar of this noble cause, I sacrificed one of my precious data input pins to serve as the JTAG clock input (TCK).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SDC script I used to generate these two clock trees drew heavy inspiration from the official LibreLane clock generation SDC, but was re-adapted from my contorted used case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# modified librelane base.sdc to support 2 clocks

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the official JTAG spec lives behind the impregnable IEEE paywall, a castle in which I am not permitted to set foot as a result of not having paid its lord my dues, the verification of the JTAG TAP was actually quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since JTAG is such a common protocol, its easy to find free resources online to build a good mental model of the internal FSM and TAP structure. My initial implementation and test bench was derived from this best effort understanding.&lt;lb/&gt;As such emulation actually became a critical step for validating this JTAG TAP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall how earlier I mentioned that JTAG was a well-supported protocol with good off-the-shelf support on the software side?&lt;lb/&gt;Did I mention OpenOCD has great support for JTAG?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I wasn’t going to get access to the official spec on how JTAG is expected to behave, plan B was to let my implementation be guided by how OpenOCD expected JTAG to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the purists clutching their pearls flabbergasted by the idea of not implementing per the spec: I’m not sorry. But if you do have the official spec here is my email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, whenever OpenOCD flagged my JTAG behavior as problematic, I assumed that my implementation was at fault. And trust me, there were issues. I called this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$$Designed\, By\, Support\,^{TM}$$&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then came the matter of supporting my custom TAP’s unholy instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, OpenOCD allows you to finetune its behavior, through custom TCL scripts (did I mention I have PTSD and now love TCL?).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to already having gone through the pain of learning to create custom OpenOCD scripts during my Alibaba accelerator salvage project, this was a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These scripts allowed me to bring up my custom TAP and add support for my own godforsaken instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The script can be found here, and below is &lt;del&gt;proof of my crime&lt;/del&gt; a log of me interfacing with my design during emulation:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Readers having reached enlightenment in their level of familiarity with the JTAG protocol might notice that the chip actually advertises itself as an Nvidia accelerator (mfg &lt;code&gt;0x06b&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s good to have dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And somehow, against all odds, I made it! I met this absurd self-imposed deadline and the chip is now in fabrication!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project was a battle against time. But making it fit in the end is something I’m honestly very proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the big difficulties was to not get side-tracked. Even if it was frustrating, I had to commit to only adding the minimal set of features needed to get the project rolling. And trust me, the temptation to add, just that one extra little teeny-tiny feature, either to the systolic array or the debug system, was excruciating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is that, with this upcoming tapeout (v2 has already started), I can finally lash out !! My grand strategy is for the next project to be an improvement of both concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, I’d like to finally have a rematch with an old adversary of mine: Floating Point arithmetics! Less for the TOPS-&amp;gt;FLOPS bragging rights, but rather to finally pierce its deep mysteries through an optimized hardware implementation of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, I will continue extending my debug infrastructure: adding scan chains and an ATPG flow not only to help identify silicon manufacturing issues, but also as a convenient way to extract the current state of all flops for usage debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, this is but another step towards my greater long term objective: to tape out my own chip, not as part of Tiny Tapeout, nor as part of a shuttle chip, but entirely on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many minutiea of the ASIC’s design that for now (and for good reason) abstracted away by Tiny Tapeout. So, my objective is to use these shuttle programs as a harness while I master the missing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to finish with a thanks to a company, which has not been sponsoring me in any way, is totally unaware of my existence, but who, never the less, never fail to provide the level of reward desperately needed after an all nighter spent trying to wrap up my design:&lt;/p&gt;

The autoregressive Decode phase of the underlying Transformer model makes LLM inference fundamentally different from training. Exacerbated by recent AI trends, the primary challenges are memory and interconnect rather than compute. To address these challenges, we highlight four architecture research opportunities: High Bandwidth Flash for 10X memory capacity with HBM-like bandwidth; Processing-Near-Memory and 3D memory-logic stacking for high memory bandwidth; and low-latency interconnect to speedup communication. While our focus is datacenter AI, we also review their applicability for mobile devices.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Xiaoyu Ma [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Thu, 8 Jan 2026 15:52:11 UTC (832 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:37:46 UTC (983 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.AR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft issues SECOND emergency out of band update for Windows 11 to address disastrous Patch Tuesday bugs — KB5078127 released globally&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another out of band update has been issued to Windows 11 users to address a major bug that caused Outlook, Dropbox, and more to become inoperable after January's disastrous Patch Tuesday updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 11 have been a total disaster, seemingly introducing more problems than it fixed. The botched update has already forced the company to issue one emergency out of band update to fix two major issues, and now a second emergency out of band update has been released to address another critical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time around, the out of band update is addressing an issue that caused Outlook and "cloud-backed" applications such as OneDrive and Dropbox to be rendered inoperable after Patch Tuesday. The temporary workaround was to uninstall the latest security updates, but now the KB5078127 update for version 24H2 and 25H2 should mitigate this need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"An out-of-band (OOB) update was released today, January 24, 2026, to address this issue," Microsoft says in newly published documentation. "This cumulative update includes all protections and improvements from the January 2026 Windows security update released January 13, 2026, as well as from the OOB update released on January 17, 2026 (which introduced fixes for two known issues: remote desktop connections and hibernation failures)."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the official changelog for the KB5078127 update from Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fixed: After installing the Windows update released on and after January 13, 2026, some applications became unresponsive or encountered unexpected errors when opening files from or saving files to cloud-based storage, such as OneDrive or Dropbox. In certain Outlook configurations that store PST files on OneDrive, Outlook may hang and fail to reopen unless the process is terminated or the system is restarted. Users may also see missing sent Items or previously downloaded emails being re‑downloaded.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This same fix is being rolled out to various other versions and editions of Windows too, including Windows 11 version 23H2, Windows Server editions, and more. Be sure to check out the Windows release health dashboard for the latest information impacting your version of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the second emergency out of band update that Microsoft has pushed out for Windows 11 users in a week. The first arrived on January 17, and fixed two major issues that began appearing for users after installing this month's Patch Tuesday updates released on January 13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Patch Tuesday release introduced an issue that caused PCs running version 23H2 to fail to shutdown or hibernate, and also broke signing into Windows 11 PCs using Remote Desktop. Microsoft addressed these issues in the out of band update issued on January 17, but in the process broke apps like Outlook, OneDrive, and Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's clear that the quality bar for Windows is at an all time low right now, marking an absolutely dreadful start to the year for Microsoft and Windows. It feels like there's nowhere to go but up at this point, so hopefully things improve with the next Patch Tuesday release.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A fast and friendly Rust TUI for managing QEMU/KVM virtual machines. Discover, create, organize, launch, and manage VMs with an intuitive interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Para-virtualized 3D acceleration works with NVIDIA GPUs in VMs created by &lt;code&gt;vm-curator&lt;/code&gt;! Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was extensively tested by the developer on an RTX-4090 in Arch Linux using NVIDIA driver 590.48.01. The guest OS still has to support QEMU 3D-accelleration. &lt;code&gt;(virtio-vga-gl with gl=on.)&lt;/code&gt; Note this is not the same as full GPU Passthrough (the kind requiring multiple GPUs and/or jumping through many, many hoops.) Support for full GPU passthrough is being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM Discovery &amp;amp; Organization&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically scans your VM library for directories containing &lt;code&gt;launch.sh&lt;/code&gt;scripts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hierarchical organization by OS family (Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parses QEMU launch scripts to extract configuration (emulator, memory, CPU, VGA, audio, disks)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smart categorization based on configurable hierarchy patterns&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VM Creation Wizard&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5-step guided wizard for creating new VMs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;50+ pre-configured OS profiles with optimal QEMU settings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic UEFI firmware detection across Linux distributions (Arch, Debian, Fedora, NixOS, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ISO file browser for selecting installation media&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable disk size, memory, CPU cores, and QEMU options&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for custom OS entries with user metadata&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Snapshot Management&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create, restore, and delete snapshots for qcow2 disk images&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visual snapshot list with timestamps and sizes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Background operations with progress feedback&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch Script Editor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;launch.sh&lt;/code&gt;scripts directly in the TUI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syntax-aware display with line numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic QEMU configuration re-parsing after saves&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;USB Passthrough&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;USB device enumeration via libudev&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Select devices for passthrough to VMs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent passthrough configuration&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional Features&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vim-style navigation (j/k, arrows, mouse)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search and filter VMs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple boot modes (normal, install, custom ISO)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OS metadata with historical blurbs and fun facts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ASCII art logos for classic operating systems&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable settings with persistence&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The latest&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Bold attempt: American rock climber Alex Honnold summited the Taipei 101 skyscraper — with no ropes or safety net — in an event broadcast live. CNN is on the scene, and we’ll bring you the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• New heights: The 1,667-foot Taipei 101 is one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world. Honnold told CNN that the challenges in climbing a building are different from scaling rock faces, and that he’d been wanting to scale a skyscraper for about a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Gripping scenes: Honnold is best known for climbing the 3,000-foot El Capitan without safety gear in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alex Honnold is best known for free soloing El Capitan. Why was it so groundbreaking?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Alex Honnold free soloed Yosemite’s 3,200-foot granite monolith El Capitan without any safety ropes in 2017, an act immortalized in the BAFTA and Oscar winning documentary “Free Solo,” the climbing world erupted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red Bull called him “the most outstanding” of free soloists in history. Climber Tommy Caldwell told National Geographic that Honnold’s climb was “the moon landing of free-soloing.” Fellow climber Peter Croft said it was so impressive that “after this, I really don’t see what’s next.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons this climb was so groundbreaking. Iconic for its near-vertical cliffs, El Capitan was believed to be impossible to climb until 1958, when American rock climbing pioneer Warren Harding made it to the top with two aides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they used ropes – unlike Honnold, who only used his hands, feet and a bag of climbing chalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cliffs are famous for being steep and smooth, without the clear handholds and footholds that climbers normally rely upon. There are fractures and fissures in the rock, which climbers can wedge their hands and feet in, but these are highly technical and challenging moves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honnold finished his free solo climb in a little under four hours, but that is considerably fast — seasoned climbers could take days to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sheer difficulty of this climb is why Honnold painstakingly prepared for his iconic ascent. He trained for more than a year in locations around the world, and climbed El Capitan with ropes dozens of times until he had memorized the route and was confident he could do it without safety gear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;101 stories and anti-earthquake engineering: What to know about Taipei 101&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you look at photos of the Taiwanese capital, an iconic skyscraper stands out on its skyline: Taipei 101.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 1,667 feet tall (508 meters) with 101 floors, it was the world’s tallest building for several years until it was usurped by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Several more skyscrapers have since surpassed the record, but it remains a spectacle in Taipei as it is the tallest building in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s composed of eight stacked segments that evoke the image of bamboo, and is built to withstand the strong earthquakes and typhoons that often strike the island. It’s constructed with reinforced concrete — combining concrete’s compressive strength with steel’s tensile strength makes the building flexible enough to sway, yet rigid enough to resist high winds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High within the tower is another technological innovation — a huge orb-like device known as a tuned mass damper, which acts like a pendulum that counteracts (or “dampens”) swaying motions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the skyscraper has various uses: as retail and office space, and as a tourist attraction with an observation deck on the upper floors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Honnold hopes Taipei 101 climb inspires people to use their time in "meaningful" ways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold said in a news conference that he hopes people will draw inspiration from his climb of Taipei 101 to chase their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One of the things that I learned from the film ‘Free Solo’ over the years is that people often take the message that they need from it,” he said, referring to the 2018 documentary of his record-breaking free solo of El Capitan in Yosemite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think that people often find the inspiration that they need to pursue their own challenges or their own goals. It’s often the kick they need to do whatever it is that they want to do in their life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Often they’ll watch something like this and it’s a reminder that their time is finite and they should use it in the best way, the most meaningful way that they can. If anything, I hope that that’s what people take from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alex Honnold's wife describes "truly wild" energy from spectators watching Taipei 101 climb&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold’s wife, Sanni McCandless, was on the scene during his climb this morning – and at one point waved to him from inside Taipei 101 as he passed by her on his way up the skyscraper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I knew the second he left the ground, it would all just kind of — not fade away, but get quieter, be a little bit more of an internal experience, and then just be joyful,” she added. “I was really happy once it just started. There wasn’t any waiting, and he got to do what he wanted to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Weather delay only made climb feel more like an "adventure," Honnold says&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold had originally been scheduled to climb Taipei 101 on Saturday morning local time – but it was delayed by a day due to poor weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inclement weather “kind of makes it feel more like rock climbing,” Honnold said at a news conference after the climb. “It really feels like we’ve been here on a climbing expedition, climbing in the mountains, because of the weather swirling and the rain and the wind and everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It makes the whole experience of coming to Taipei and climbing feel like a grand adventure,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added that he loved the training process leading up to the ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I basically just love having a reason to train,” he said. “I was definitely on my A-game performing today, and you can’t necessarily bring that to every training session, because sometimes you’re just tired or whatever else. But I love the whole process.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The highly anticipated Netflix live special of climber Alex Honnold free soloing the Taipei 101 skyscraper was postponed to Saturday night Eastern time, due to bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NOW: Press conference with Alex Honnold&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold is holding a press conference following his successful free solo climb of Taipei 101. Stay tuned for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Netflix, which broadcast "Skyscraper Live," does live programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you watched “Skyscraper Live,” the live broadcast of Alex Honnold’s Taipei 101 climb, you might be wondering: Is this telecast on some sort of delay? The answer is yes. Netflix confirmed to CNN that the live feed was subject to a ten-second delay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means the production control room would have been able to shield viewers if the cameras captured an unsettling sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Netflix, which started with DVDs by mail and transformed into an on-demand streaming library, is trying to turn itself into a live TV powerhouse. It billed “Skyscraper Live” as its first international live event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s “going to be an edge-of-your-seat TV experience for sure,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on the company’s quarterly earnings call earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Netflix executives view live programming as a way to retain existing subscribers with something new and captivating, as well as a way to sign up new users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sarandos said Netflix has “executed more than 200 live events” so far, from comedy shows to World Wrestling Entertainment matches to award telecasts. Many of the events have been primarily for US audiences, though some have also streamed around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week the service launched a live talent competition called “Star Search.” And in March it will start to stream the World Baseball Classic in Japan for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Taiwan president congratulates Honnold for completing Taipei 101 climb&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te congratulated Alex Honnold after the American rock climber summited Taipei 101 with no ropes and safety net, saying the spectacle was “truly nerve-wracking” to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honnold completed his free solo climb of Taipei 101 in one hour and 32 minutes with crowds watching from the streets below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lai said the event, broadcast live globally, allowed the world to see “the warmth of the Taiwanese people and the island’s beautiful hills and landscapes,” as well as Taipei 101.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Alex Honnold thinks free soloing Taipei 101 is “very safe”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climber Alex Honnold is doing what he loves, but what most would consider an absolute nightmare — climbing tall, daunting mountains without the use of ropes, harnesses or any protective gear, using just his hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While preparing to climb Taipei 101 without ropes or safety equipment, he told CNN last month that he felt the climb was “very safe” and that “it’s not really that much different from what I do in day-to-day life as a professional rock climber.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think about risk and death and mortality, all those kinds of things, far more than the average person,” he continued. “I mean, you’re obviously faced with your own mortality all the time, but you’re choosing to do them anyway because it provides richness and meaning to your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What comes after climbing Taipei 101? Probably a shower, food and savoring life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do world-class climbers do after summiting Taipei 101?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not much, according to French climber Alain Robert, who climbed Taipei 101 using ropes in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“First of all, you’re not really tired,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Alex told me (before the climb) the building itself isn’t that difficult. So he’s not in a state of mind which is completely exhausted, we could see that he was perfectly fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honnold, who just successfully free soloed the skyscraper without any ropes or safety nets, will likely do what any athlete does after exercising – take a shower, get dressed, and fuel up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Honnold embraces wife, who jokes: "I was having a panic attack the entire time"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one hour and 32 minutes — just two minutes over his own estimation — Alex Honnold completed his free solo climb of Taipei 101, an eye-boggling spectacle live-streamed by Netflix and watched by a huge crowd of spectators on the streets below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After completing the climb, he was met on a balcony by his wife Sanni McCandless, who greeted him with an enthusiastic hug and kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I thought I was going pretty slow,” Honnold said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His wife responded, “No, you were fast. I was basically having a panic attack the entire time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“French Spiderman” summited Taipei 101 in 2004&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold isn’t the first person to climb Taipei 101, but he is the first known to have done it without ropes or safety nets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Urban climber Alain Robert, also known as the “French Spiderman,” climbed the 101-story Taiwanese skyscraper as part of the building’s opening in 2004. He gave commentary on Honnold’s climb today in CNN’s live coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a safety belt and rope, Robert took four hours to complete the ascent on Christmas Day amid rainy weather. The building also wasn’t finished at the time, with some metal beams still bearing slippery vinyl covers, complicating his attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two climbers compared notes on a recent episode of Honnold’s podcast “Climbing Gold,” in which Robert advised Honnold to take breaks and fuel up if needed after climbing each of the eight segments on the tower’s exterior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rock climber turned his attention to urban feats in the mid-1990s. The 63-year-old usually completes his summits without the help of any safety equipment, relying only on his bare hands and a small bag of chalk for better grip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robert has climbed several famous landmarks, including New York’s Empire State Building, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris — some of which he did free solo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some of Robert’s escapades are done legally — after being invited by countries or enterprises to “christen” the unveiling of a new building — he has been arrested over 120 times for similar stunts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Life has to be dangerous,” Robert told CNN in a 2010 interview. “There is a percentage of people who want to be a little bit outside their comfort zone and I am one of them, someone who lives on the edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👋 “French Spiderman” Alain Robert here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good job, Alex!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know what you felt, actually, because I felt it many times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(When I climbed Taipei 101 in 2004), there was very strong wind … it was really raining. We can see there isn’t much wind (right now), actually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, it felt incredible - although I was not risking my life because I had a rope, the weather conditions were so horrible (and) it took me four hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s got a phone, he’s taking a selfie! I know Alex, all along I was confident … I didn’t worry at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BREAKING: Honnold summits skyscraper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climber Alex Honnold has reached the top of Taipei 101 safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He’s the first person known to climb the 1,667-foot building, one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world, without ropes or safety nets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Watch: Crowd of spectators cheer, "Add oil!"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watch the spectators below Taipei 101 cheer on Alex Honnold as he took a break to wave to the crowd, with a common encouragement in Chinese: “Add oil!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Honnold reaches 101st floor, now climbing spire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold has just passed the 101st floor of Taipei 101. He now has the spire of the building yet to climb, which is around 70 meters (200 ft).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👋 “French Spiderman” Alain Robert here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Alex) must be really, really happy because he’s fully concentrated, he’s knowing perfectly – each move is really precise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re happy when you are reaching the top, meaning for as long as you’re climbing, you’re completely focused on your target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s really enjoyable watching him … There are a few overhangs, but there is one that is a bit bigger than others (up ahead). He looks more focused on this particular part of the ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know that most people, they don’t understand why every day (I free solo) … because this is my life path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All good, Alex!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alex Honnold has reached the top of the eight "bamboo boxes." Now comes the hard part&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold has finished climbing the eight “bamboo box” sections that make up most of Taipei 101, each made up of eight stories. But he’s not done yet – with some challenging moves ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an observation deck on the 91st floor, above the last “box” section. Then the final part of the ascent stretches from the 92nd to 101st floor; if Honnold succeeds, he would reach the top of the skyscraper, which has a metallic lightning rod structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;👋 “French Spiderman” Alain Robert here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Alex is) doing well. It seems that maybe he’s a bit tired. I think he has slowed down a bit … he’s taking longer rests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is really about finding the right rhythm. This kind of structure allows you to recover a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more you are climbing, the more there is fatigue inside your muscles, and of course, you need to evacuate this lactic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting climb because there is a variety of moves. It’s not always the same movement from bottom to top.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Climbing gym holds watch party as Alex Honnold scales Taipei 101&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across North America, several climbing gyms are holding watch parties for Alex Honnold’s ascent of Taipei 101.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general manager of a climbing gym in Hoboken, New Jersey, told CNN its members and staff were “very excited” for the climb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everyone has seen ‘Free Solo’, but getting to watch Alex free solo the Taipei 101 live on Netflix is at another level,” said Julissa Chevres, general manager of the Hoboken and Montclair branches of The Gravity Vaults gym – referencing the 2018 documentary chronicling Honnold’s historic free solo of Yosemite’s El Capitan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She added that the staff and members were confident in Honnold’s ability to summit the skyscraper, and that the climbing community holds “much respect” for his skills and mental fortitude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our sport is still relatively young and more often than not, a person is coming into our gyms to climb for the first time after they have watched ‘Free Solo’ or come across a video of Alex climbing,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This particular climb being streamed live on Netflix is another way to reach those that may not be familiar with the sport of climbing, and may be the thing that encourages someone to walk into an indoor rock climbing gym for the first time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other climbing gyms that have announced on social media their plans to hold watch parties include University of Southern California’s climbing club, Ottawa bouldering gym Klimat and North Mass Boulder in Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TWENTY-YEARS AGO, Dwight Macdonald published a series of articles in Politics on the responsibility of peoples and, specifically, the responsibility of intellectuals. I read them as an undergraduate, in the years just after the war, and had occasion to read them again a few months ago. They seem to me to have lost none of their power or persuasiveness. Macdonald is concerned with the question of war guilt. He asks the question: To what extent were the German or Japanese people responsible for the atrocities committed by their governments? And, quite properly, he turns the question back to us: To what extent are the British or American people responsible for the vicious terror bombings of civilians, perfected as a technique of warfare by the Western democracies and reaching their culmination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, surely among the most unspeakable crimes in history. To an undergraduate in 1945-46—to anyone whose political and moral consciousness had been formed by the horrors of the 1930s, by the war in Ethiopia, the Russian purge, the “China Incident,” the Spanish Civil War, the Nazi atrocities, the Western reaction to these events and, in part, complicity in them—these questions had particular significance and poignancy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With respect to the responsibility of intellectuals, there are still other, equally disturbing questions. Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions. In the Western world, at least, they have the power that comes from political liberty, from access to information and freedom of expression. For a privileged minority, Western democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us. The responsibilities of intellectuals, then, are much deeper than what Macdonald calls the “responsibility of people,” given the unique privileges that intellectuals enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The issues that Macdonald raised are as pertinent today as they were twenty years ago. We can hardly avoid asking ourselves to what extent the American people bear responsibility for the savage American assault on a largely helpless rural population in Vietnam, still another atrocity in what Asians see as the “Vasco da Gama era” of world history. As for those of us who stood by in silence and apathy as this catastrophe slowly took shape over the past dozen years—on what page of history do we find our proper place? Only the most insensible can escape these questions. I want to return to them, later on, after a few scattered remarks about the responsibility of intellectuals and how, in practice, they go about meeting this responsibility in the mid-1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies. This, at least, may seem enough of a truism to pass over without comment. Not so, however. For the modern intellectual, it is not at all obvious. Thus we have Martin Heidegger writing, in a pro-Hitler declaration of 1933, that “truth is the revelation of that which makes a people certain, clear, and strong in its action and knowledge”; it is only this kind of “truth” that one has a responsibility to speak. Americans tend to be more forthright. When Arthur Schlesinger was asked by The New York Times in November, 1965, to explain the contradiction between his published account of the Bay of Pigs incident and the story he had given the press at the time of the attack, he simply remarked that he had lied; and a few days later, he went on to compliment the Times for also having suppressed information on the planned invasion, in “the national interest,” as this term was defined by the group of arrogant and deluded men of whom Schlesinger gives such a flattering portrait in his recent account of the Kennedy Administration. It is of no particular interest that one man is quite happy to lie in behalf of a cause which he knows to be unjust; but it is significant that such events provoke so little response in the intellectual community—for example, no one has said that there is something strange in the offer of a major chair in the humanities to a historian who feels it to be his duty to persuade the world that an American-sponsored invasion of a nearby country is nothing of the sort. And what of the incredible sequence of lies on the part of our government and its spokesmen concerning such matters as negotiations in Vietnam? The facts are known to all who care to know. The press, foreign and domestic, has presented documentation to refute each falsehood as it appears. But the power of the government’s propaganda apparatus is such that the citizen who does not undertake a research project on the subject can hardly hope to confront government pronouncements with fact.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deceit and distortion surrounding the American invasion of Vietnam is by now so familiar that it has lost its power to shock. It is therefore useful to recall that although new levels of cynicism are constantly being reached, their clear antecedents were accepted at home with quiet toleration. It is a useful exercise to compare Government statements at the time of the invasion of Guatemala in 1954 with Eisenhower’s admission—to be more accurate, his boast—a decade later that American planes were sent “to help the invaders” (New York Times, October 14, 1965). Nor is it only in moments of crisis that duplicity is considered perfectly in order. “New Frontiersmen,” for example, have scarcely distinguished themselves by a passionate concern for historical accuracy, even when they are not being called upon to provide a “propaganda cover” for ongoing actions. For example, Arthur Schlesinger (New York Times, February 6, 1966) describes the bombing of North Vietnam and the massive escalation of military commitment in early 1965 as based on a “perfectly rational argument”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;so long as the Vietcong thought they were going to win the war, they obviously would not be interested in any kind of negotiated settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The date is important. Had this statement been made six months earlier, one could attribute it to ignorance. But this statement appeared after the UN, North Vietnamese, and Soviet initiatives had been front-page news for months. It was already public knowledge that these initiatives had preceeded the escalation of February 1965 and, in fact, continued for several weeks after the bombing began. Correspondents in Washington tried desperately to find some explanation for the startling deception that had been revealed. Chalmers Roberts, for example, wrote in the Boston Globe on November 19 with unconscious irony:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[late February, 1965] hardly seemed to Washington to be a propitious moment for negotiations [since] Mr. Johnson…had just ordered the first bombing of North Vietnam in an effort to bring Hanoi to a conference table where the bargaining chips on both sides would be more closely matched.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming at that moment, Schlesinger’s statement is less an example of deceit than of contempt—contempt for an audience that can be expected to tolerate such behavior with silence, if not approval.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TO TURN TO SOMEONE closer to the actual formation and implementation of policy, consider some of the reflections of Walt Rostow, a man who, according to Schlesinger, brought a “spacious historical view” to the conduct of foreign affairs in the Kennedy administration.3 According to his analysis, the guerrilla warfare in Indo-China in 1946 was launched by Stalin,4 and Hanoi initiated the guerrilla war against South Vietnam in 1958 (The View from the Seventh Floor pp. 39 and 152). Similarly, the Communist planners probed the “free world spectrum of defense” in Northern Azerbaijan and Greece (where Stalin “supported substantial guerrilla warfare”—ibid., pp. 36 and 148), operating from plans carefully laid in 1945. And in Central Europe, the Soviet Union was not “prepared to accept a solution which would remove the dangerous tensions from Central Europe at the risk of even slowly staged corrosion of Communism in East Germany” (ibid., p. 156).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is interesting to compare these observations with studies by scholars actually concerned with historical events. The remark about Stalin’s initiating the first Vietnamese war in 1946 does not even merit refutation. As to Hanoi’s purported initiative of 1958, the situation is more clouded. But even government sources5 concede that in 1959 Hanoi received the first direct reports of what Diem referred to6 as his own Algerian war and that only after this did they lay their plans to involve themselves in this struggle. In fact, in December, 1958, Hanoi made another of its many attempts—rebuffed once again by Saigon and the United States—to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with the Saigon government on the basis of the status quo.7 Rostow offers no evidence of Stalin’s support for the Greek guerrillas; in fact, though the historical record is far from clear, it seems that Stalin was by no means pleased with the adventurism of the Greek guerrillas, who, from his point of view, were upsetting the satisfactory post-war imperialist settlement.8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rostow’s remarks about Germany are more interesting still. He does not see fit to mention, for example, the Russian notes of March-April, 1952, which proposed unification of Germany under internationally supervised elections, with withdrawal of all troops within a year, if there was a guarantee that a reunified Germany would not be permitted to join a Western military alliance.9 And he has also momentarily forgotten his own characterization of the strategy of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations: “to avoid any serious negotiation with the Soviet Union until the West could confront Moscow with German rearmament within an organized European framework, as a fait accompli“10—to be sure, in defiance of the Potsdam agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But most interesting of all is Rostow’s reference to Iran. The facts are that there was a Russian attempt to impose by force a pro-Soviet government in Northern Azerbaijan that would grant the Soviet Union access to Iranian oil. This was rebuffed by superior Anglo-American force in 1946, at which point the more powerful imperialism obtained full rights to Iranian oil for itself, with the installation of a pro-Western government. We recall what happened when, for a brief period in the early 1950s, the only Iranian government with something of a popular base experimented with the curious idea that Iranian oil should belong to the Iranians. What is interesting, however, is the description of Northern Azerbaijan as part of “the free world spectrum of defense.” It is pointless, by now, to comment on the debasement of the phrase “free world.” But by what law of nature does Iran, with its resources, fall within Western dominion? The bland assumption that it does is most revealing of deep-seated attitudes toward the conduct of foreign affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IN ADDITION to this growing lack of concern for truth, we find, in recent published statements, a real or feigned naiveté about American actions that reaches startling proportions. For example, Arthur Schlesinger, according to the Times, February 6, 1966, characterized our Vietnamese policies of 1954 as “part of our general program of international goodwill.” Unless intended as irony, this remark shows either a colossal cynicism, or the inability, on a scale that defies measurement, to comprehend elementary phenomena of contemporary history. Similarly, what is one to make of the testimony of Thomas Schelling before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, January 27, 1965, in which he discusses two great dangers if all Asia “goes Communist”?11 First, this would exclude “the United States and what we call Western civilization from a large part of the world that is poor and colored and potentially hostile.” Second, “a country like the United States probably cannot maintain self-confidence if just about the greatest thing it ever attempted, namely to create the basis for decency and prosperity and democratic government in the underdeveloped world, had to be acknowledged as a failure or as an attempt that we wouldn’t try again.” It surpasses belief that a person with even a minimal acquaintance with the record of American foreign policy could produce such statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It surpasses belief, that is, unless we look at the matter from a more historical point of view, and place such statements in the context of the hypocritical moralism of the past; for example, of Woodrow Wilson, who was going to teach the Latin Americans the art of good government, and who wrote (1902) that it is “our peculiar duty” to teach colonial peoples “order and self-control…[and]…the drill and habit of law and obedience….” Or of the missionaries of the 1840s, who described the hideous and degrading opium wars as “the result of a great design of Providence to make the wickedness of men subserve his purposes of mercy toward China, in breaking through her wall of exclusion, and bringing the empire into more immediate contact with western and Christian nations.” Or, to approach the present, of A.A. Berle, who, in commenting on the Dominican intervention, has the impertinence to attribute the problems of the Caribbean countries to imperialism—Russian imperialism.12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AS A FINAL EXAMPLE of this failure of skepticism, consider the remarks of Henry Kissinger in his concluding remarks at the Harvard-Oxford television debate on America’s Vietnam policies. He observed, rather sadly, that what disturbs him most is that others question not our judgment, but our motives—a remarkable comment by a man whose professional concern is political analysis, that is, analysis of the actions of governments in terms of motives that are unexpressed in official propaganda and perhaps only dimly perceived by those whose acts they govern. No one would be disturbed by an analysis of the political behavior of the Russians, French, or Tanzanians questioning their motives and interpreting their actions by the long-range interests concealed behind their official rhetoric. But it is an article of faith that American motives are pure, and not subject to analysis (see note 1). Although it is nothing new in American intellectual history—or, for that matter, in the general history of imperialist apologia—this innocence becomes increasingly distasteful as the power it serves grows more dominant in world affairs, and more capable, therefore, of the unconstrained viciousness that the mass media present to us each day. We are hardly the first power in history to combine material interests, great technological capacity, and an utter disregard for the suffering and misery of the lower orders. The long tradition of naiveté and self-righteousness that disfigures our intellectual history, however, must serve as a warning to the third world, if such a warning is needed, as to how our protestations of sincerity and benign intent are to be interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic assumptions of the “New Frontiersmen” should be pondered carefully by those who look forward to the involvement of academic intellectuals in politics. For example, I have referred above to Arthur Schlesinger’s objections to the Bay of Pigs invasion, but the reference was imprecise. True, he felt that it was a “terrible idea,” but “not because the notion of sponsoring an exile attempt to overthrow Castro seemed intolerable in itself.” Such a reaction would be the merest sentimentality, unthinkable to a tough-minded realist. The difficulty, rather, was that it seemed unlikely that the deception could succeed. The operation, in his view, was ill-conceived but not otherwise objectionable.13 In a similar vein, Schlesinger quotes with approval Kennedy’s “realistic” assessment of the situation resulting from Trujillo’s assassination:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are three possibilities in descending order of preference: a decent democratic regime, a continuation of the Trujillo regime or a Castro regime. We ought to aim at the first, but we really can’t renounce the second until we are sure that we can avoid the third [p. 769].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason why the third possibility is so intolerable is explained a few pages later (p. 774): “Communist success in Latin America would deal a much harder blow to the power and influence of the United States.” Of course, we can never really be sure of avoiding the third possibility; therefore, in practice, we will always settle for the second, as we are now doing in Brazil and Argentina, for example.14&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or consider Walt Rostow’s views on American policy in Asia.15 The basis on which we must build this policy is that “we are openly threatened and we feel menaced by Communist China.” To prove that we are menaced is of course unnecessary, and the matter receives no attention; it is enough that we feel menaced. Our policy must be based on our national heritage and our national interests. Our national heritage is briefly outlined in the following terms: “Throughout the nineteenth century, in good conscience Americans could devote themselves to the extension of both their principles and their power on this continent,” making use of “the somewhat elastic concept of the Monroe doctrine” and, of course, extending “the American interest to Alaska and the mid-Pacific islands…. Both our insistence on unconditional surrender and the idea of post-war occupation…represented the formulation of American security interests in Europe and Asia.” So much for our heritage. As to our interests, the matter is equally simple. Fundamental is our “profound interest that societies abroad develop and strengthen those elements in their respective cultures that elevate and protect the dignity of the individual against the state.” At the same time, we must counter the “ideological threat,” namely “the possibility that the Chinese Communists can prove to Asians by progress in China that Communist methods are better and faster than democratic methods.” Nothing is said about those people in Asian cultures to whom our “conception of the proper relation of the individual to the state” may not be the uniquely important value, people who might, for example, be concerned with preserving the “dignity of the individual” against concentrations of foreign or domestic capital, or against semi-feudal structures (such as Trujillo-type dictatorships) introduced or kept in power by American arms. All of this is flavored with allusions to “our religious and ethical value systems” and to our “diffuse and complex concepts” which are to the Asian mind “so much more difficult to grasp” than Marxist dogma, and are so “disturbing to some Asians” because of “their very lack of dogmatism.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such intellectual contributions as these suggest the need for a correction to De Gaulle’s remark, in his Memoirs, about the American “will to power, cloaking itself in idealism.” By now, this will to power is not so much cloaked in idealism as it is drowned in fatuity. And academic intellectuals have made their unique contribution to this sorry picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LET US, HOWEVER, RETURN to the war in Vietnam and the response that it has aroused among American intellectuals. A striking feature of the recent debate on Southeast Asian policy has been the distinction that is commonly drawn between “responsible criticism,” on the one hand, and “sentimental,” or “emotional,” or “hysterical” criticism, on the other. There is much to be learned from a careful study of the terms in which this distinction is drawn. The “hysterical critics” are to be identified, apparently, by their irrational refusal to accept one fundamental political axiom, namely that the United States has the right to extend its power and control without limit, insofar as is feasible. Responsible criticism does not challenge this assumption, but argues, rather, that we probably can’t “get away with it” at this particular time and place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distinction of this sort seems to be what Irving Kristol, for example, has in mind in his analysis of the protest over Vietnam policy (Encounter, August, 1965). He contrasts the responsible critics, such as Walter Lippmann, the Times, and Senator Fulbright, with the “teach-in movement.” “Unlike the university protesters,” he points out, “Mr. Lippmann engages in no presumptuous suppositions as to ‘what the Vietnamese people really want’—he obviously doesn’t much care—or in legalistic exegesis as to whether, or to what extent, there is ‘aggression’ or ‘revolution’ in South Vietnam. His is a realpolitik point of view; and he will apparently even contemplate the possibility of a nuclear war against China in extreme circumstances.” This is commendable, and contrasts favorably, for Kristol, with the talk of the “unreasonable, ideological types” in the teach-in movement, who often seem to be motivated by such absurdities as “simple, virtuous ‘anti-imperialism,’ “who deliver “harangues on ‘the power structure,’ ” and who even sometimes stoop so low as to read “articles and reports from the foreign press on the American presence in Vietnam.” Furthermore, these nasty types are often psychologists, mathematicians, chemists, or philosophers (just as, incidentally, those most vocal in protest in the Soviet Union are generally physicists, literary intellectuals, and others remote from the exercise of power), rather than people with Washington contacts, who, of course, realize that “had they a new, good idea about Vietnam, they would get a prompt and respectful hearing” in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not interested here in whether Kristol’s characterization of protest and dissent is accurate, but rather in the assumptions on which it rests. Is the purity of American motives a matter that is beyond discussion, or that is irrelevant to discussion? Should decisions be left to “experts” with Washington contacts—even if we assume that they command the necessary knowledge and principles to make the “best” decision, will they invariably do so? And, a logically prior question, is “expertise” applicable—that is, is there a body of theory and of relevant information, not in the public domain, that can be applied to the analysis of foreign policy or that demonstrates the correctness of present actions in some way that psychologists, mathematicians, chemists, and philosophers are incapable of comprehending? Although Kristol does not examine these questions directly, his attitude presupposes answers, answers which are wrong in all cases. American aggressiveness, however it may be masked in pious rhetoric, is a dominant force in world affairs and must be analyzed in terms of its causes and motives. There is no body of theory or significant body of relevant information, beyond the comprehension of the layman, which makes policy immune from criticism. To the extent that “expert knowledge” is applied to world affairs, it is surely appropriate—for a person of any integrity, quite necessary—to question its quality and the goals it serves. These facts seem too obvious to require extended discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A CORRECTIVE to Kristol’s curious belief in the Administration’s openness to new thinking about Vietnam is provided by McGeorge Bundy in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs (January, 1967). As Bundy correctly observes, “on the main stage…the argument on Viet Nam turns on tactics, not fundamentals,” although, he adds, “there are wild men in the wings.” On stage center are, of course, the President (who in his recent trip to Asia had just “magisterially reaffirmed” our interest “in the progress of the people across the Pacific”) and his advisers, who deserve “the understanding support of those who want restraint.” It is these men who deserve the credit for the fact that “the bombing of the North has been the most accurate and the most restrained in modern warfare”—a solicitude which will be appreciated by the inhabitants, or former inhabitants of Nam Dinh and Phu Ly and Vinh. It is these men, too, who deserve the credit for what was reported by Malcolm Browne as long ago as May, 1965:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the South, huge sectors of the nation have been declared “free bombing zones,” in which anything that moves is a legitimate target. Tens of thousands of tons of bombs, rockets, napalm and cannon fire are poured into these vast areas each week. If only by the laws of chance, bloodshed is believed to be heavy in these raids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the developing countries, Bundy assures us, “American democracy has no taste for imperialism,” and “taken as a whole, the stock of American experience, understanding, sympathy and simple knowledge is now much the most impressive in the world.” It is true that “four-fifths of all the foreign investing in the world is now done by Americans” and that “the most admired plans and policies…are no better than their demonstrable relation to the American interest”—just as it is true, so we read in the same issue of Foreign Affairs, that the plans for armed action against Cuba were put into motion a few weeks after Mikoyan visited Havana, “invading what had so long been an almost exclusively American sphere of influence.” Unfortunately, such facts as these are often taken by unsophisticated Asian intellectuals as indicating a “taste for imperialism.” For example, a number of Indians have expressed their “near exasperation” at the fact that “we have done everything we can to attract foreign capital for fertilizer plants, but the American and the other Western private companies know we are over a barrel, so they demand stringent terms which we just cannot meet” (Christian Science Monitor, November 26), while “Washington…doggedly insists that deals be made in the private sector with private enterprise” (ibid., December 5).16 But this reaction, no doubt, simply reveals, once again, how the Asian mind fails to comprehend the “diffuse and complex concepts” of Western thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT MAY BE USEFUL to study carefully the “new, good ideas about Vietnam” that are receiving a “prompt and respectful hearing” in Washington these days. The US Government Printing Office is an endless source of insight into the moral and intellectual level of this expert advice. In its publications one can read, for example, the testimony of Professor David N. Rowe, Director of Graduate Studies in International Relations at Yale University, before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs (see note 11). Professor Rowe proposes (p. 266) that the United States buy all surplus Canadian and Australian wheat, so that there will be mass starvation in China. These are his words:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Mind you, I am not talking about this as a weapon against the Chinese people. It will be. But that is only incidental. The weapon will be a weapon against the Government because the internal stability of that country cannot be sustained by an unfriendly Government in the face of general starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professor Rowe will have none of the sentimental moralism that might lead one to compare this suggestion with, say, the Ostpolitik of Hitler’s Germany.17 Nor does he fear the impact of such policies on other Asian nations, for example, Japan. He assures us, from his “very long acquaintance with Japanese questions,” that “the Japanese above all are people who respect power and determination.” Hence “they will not be so much alarmed by American policy in Vietnam that takes off from a position of power and intends to seek a solution based upon the imposition of our power upon local people that we are in opposition to.” What would disturb the Japanese is “a policy of indecision, a policy of refusal to face up to the problems [in China and Vietnam] and to meet our responsibilities there in a positive way,” such as the way just cited. A conviction that we were “unwilling to use the power that they know we have” might “alarm the Japanese people very intensely and shake the degree of their friendly relations with us.” In fact, a full use of American power would be particularly reassuring to the Japanese, because they have had a demonstration “of the tremendous power in action of the United States…because they have felt our power directly.” This is surely a prime example of the healthy, “realpolitik point of view” that Irving Kristol so much admires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, one may ask, why restrict ourselves to such indirect means as mass starvation? Why not bombing? No doubt this message is implicit in the remarks to the same committee of the Reverend R.J. de Jaegher, Regent of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies, Seton Hall University, who explains that like all people who have lived under Communism, the North Vietnamese “would be perfectly happy to be bombed to be free” (p. 345).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, there must be those who support the Communists. But this is really a matter of small concern, as the Hon Walter Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs from 1953-59, points out in his testimony before the same committee. He assures us that “The Peiping regime…represents something less than 3 per cent of the population” (p. 402).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider, then, how fortunate the Chinese Communist leaders are, compared to the leaders of the Vietcong, who, according to Arthur Goldberg (New York Times, February 6, 1966), represent about “one-half of one percent of the population of South Vietnam,” that is, about one-half the number of new Southern recruits for the Vietcong during 1965, if we can credit Pentagon statistics.18&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the face of such experts as these, the scientists and philosophers of whom Kristol speaks would clearly do well to continue to draw their circles in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAVING SETTLED THE ISSUE of the political irrelevance of the protest movement, Kristol turns to the question of what motivates it—more generally, what has made students and junior faculty “go left,” as he sees it, amid general prosperity and under liberal, Welfare State administrations. This, he notes, “is a riddle to which no sociologist has as yet come up with an answer.” Since these young people are well-off, have good futures, etc., their protest must be irrational. It must be the result of boredom, of too much security, or something of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other possibilities come to mind. It may be, for example, that as honest men the students and junior faculty are attempting to find out the truth for themselves rather than ceding the responsibility to “experts” or to government; and it may be that they react with indignation to what they discover. These possibilities Kristol does not reject. They are simply unthinkable, unworthy of consideration. More accurately, these possibilities are inexpressible; the categories in which they are formulated (honesty, indignation) simply do not exist for the tough-minded social scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IN THIS IMPLICIT DISPARAGEMENT of traditional intellectual values, Kristol reflects attitudes that are fairly widespread in academic circles. I do not doubt that these attitudes are in part a consequence of the desperate attempt of the social and behavioral sciences to imitate the surface features of sciences that really have significant intellectual content. But they have other sources as well. Anyone can be a moral individual, concerned with human rights and problems; but only a college professor, a trained expert, can solve technical problems by “sophisticated” methods. Ergo, it is only problems of the latter sort that are important or real. Responsible, non-ideological experts will give advice on tactical questions; irresponsible, “ideological types” will “harangue” about principle and trouble themselves over moral issues and human rights, or over the traditional problems of man and society, concerning which “social and behavioral science” has nothing to offer beyond trivalities. Obviously, these emotional, ideological types are irrational, since, being well-off and having power in their grasp, they shouldn’t worry about such matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At times this pseudo-scientific posing reaches levels that are almost pathological. Consider the phenomenon of Herman Kahn, for example. Kahn has been both denounced as immoral and lauded for his courage. By people who should know better, his On Thermonuclear War has been described “without qualification…[as]…one of the great works of our time” (Stuart Hughes). The fact of the matter is that this is surely one of the emptiest works of our time, as can be seen by applying to it the intellectual standards of any existing discipline, by tracing some of its “well-documented conclusions” to the “objective studies” from which they derive, and by following the line of argument, where detectable. Kahn proposes no theories, no explanations, no factual assumptions that can be tested against their consequences, as do the sciences he is attempting to mimic. He simply suggests a terminology and provides a facade of rationality. When particular policy conclusions are drawn, they are supported only by ex cathedra remarks for which no support is even suggested (e.g., “The civil defense line probably should be drawn somewhere below $5 billion annually” to keep from provoking the Russians—why not $50 billion, or $5.00?). What is more, Kahn is quite aware of this vacuity; in his more judicious moments he claims only that “there is no reason to believe that relatively sophisticated models are more likely to be misleading than the simpler models and analogies frequently used as an aid to judgment.” For those whose humor tends towards the macabre, it is easy to play the game of “strategic thinking” à la Kahn, and to prove what one wishes. For example, one of Kahn’s basic assumptions is that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;an all-out surprise attack in which all resources are devoted to counter-value targets would be so irrational that, barring an incredible lack of sophistication or actual insanity among Soviet decision makers, such an attack is highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple argument proves the opposite. Premise 1: American decision-makers think along the lines outlined by Herman Kahn. Premise 2: Kahn thinks it would be better for everyone to be red than for everyone to be dead. Premise 3: if the Americans were to respond to an all-out countervalue attack, then everyone would be dead. Conclusion: the Americans will not respond to an all-out countervalue attack, and therefore it should be launched without delay. Of course, one can carry the argument a step further. Fact: the Russians have not carried out an all-out countervalue attack. It follows that they are not rational. If they are not rational, there is no point in “strategic thinking.” Therefore,….&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course this is all nonsense, but nonsense that differs from Kahn’s only in the respect that the argument is of slightly greater complexity than anything to be discovered in his work. What is remarkable is that serious people actually pay attention to these absurdities, no doubt because of the facade of tough-mindedness and pseudo-science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT IS A CURIOUS and depressing fact that the “anti-war movement” falls prey all too often to similar confusions. In the fall of 1965, for example, there was an International Conference on Alternative Perspectives on Vietnam, which circulated a pamphlet to potential participants stating its assumptions. The plan was to set up study groups in which three “types of intellectual tradition” will be represented: (1) area specialists; (2) “social theory, with special emphasis on theories of the international system, of social change and development, of conflict and conflict resolution, or of revolution”; (3) “the analysis of public policy in terms of basic human values, rooted in various theological, philosophical and humanist traditions.” The second intellectual tradition will provide “general propositions, derived from social theory and tested against historical, comparative, or experimental data”; the third “will provide the framework out of which fundamental value questions can be raised and in terms of which the moral implications of societal actions can be analyzed.” The hope was that “by approaching the questions [of Vietnam policy] from the moral perspectives of all great religions and philosophical systems, we may find solutions that are more consistent with fundamental human values than current American policy in Vietnam has turned out to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, the experts on values (i.e., spokesmen for the great religions and philosophical systems) will provide fundamental insights on moral perspectives, and the experts on social theory will provide general empirically validated propositions and “general models of conflict.” From this interplay, new policies will emerge, presumably from application of the canons of scientific method. The only debatable issue, it seems to me, is whether it is more ridiculous to turn to experts in social theory for general well-confirmed propositions, or to the specialists in the great religions and philosophical systems for insights into fundamental human values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is much more that can be said about this topic, but, without continuing, I would simply like to emphasize that, as is no doubt obvious, the cult of the experts is both self-serving, for those who propound it, and fraudulent. Obviously, one must learn from social and behavioral science whatever one can; obviously, these fields should be pursued as seriously as possible. But it will be quite unfortunate, and highly dangerous, if they are not accepted and judged on their merits and according to their actual, not pretended, accomplishments. In particular, if there is a body of theory, well-tested and verified, that applies to the conduct of foreign affairs or the resolution of domestic or international conflict, its existence has been kept a well-guarded secret. In the case of Vietnam, if those who feel themselves to be experts have access to principles or information that would justify what the American government is doing in that unfortunate country, they have been singularly ineffective in making this fact known. To anyone who has any familiarity with the social and behavioral sciences (or the “policy sciences”), the claim that there are certain considerations and principles too deep for the outsider to comprehend is simply an absurdity, unworthy of comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WHEN WE CONSIDER the responsibility of intellectuals, our basic concern must be their role in the creation and analysis of ideology. And, in fact, Kristol’s contrast between the unreasonable ideological types and the responsible experts is formulated in terms that immediately bring to mind Daniel Bell’s interesting and influential “The End of Ideology,” an essay which is as important for what it leaves unsaid as for its actual content.19 Bell presents and discusses the Marxist analysis of ideology as a mask for class interest, quoting Marx’s well-known description of the belief of the bourgeoisie “that the special conditions of its emancipation are the general conditions through which alone modern society can be saved and the class struggle avoided.” He then argues that the age of ideology is ended, supplanted, at least in the West, by a general agreement that each issue must be settled in its own terms, within the framework of a Welfare State in which, presumably, experts in the conduct of public affairs will have a prominent role. Bell is quite careful, however, to characterize the precise sense of “ideology” in which “ideologies are exhausted.” He is referring to ideology only as “the conversion of ideas into social levers,” to ideology as “a set of beliefs, infused with passion,…[which] …seeks to transform the whole of a way of life.” The crucial words are “transform” and “convert into social levers.” Intellectuals in the West, he argues, have lost interest in converting ideas into social levers for the radical transformation of society. Now that we have achieved the pluralistic society of the Welfare State, they see no further need for a radical transformation of society; we may tinker with our way of life here and there, but it would be wrong to try to modify it in any significant way. With this consensus of intellectuals, ideology is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several striking facts about Bell’s essay. First, he does not point out the extent to which this consensus of the intellectuals is self-serving. He does not relate his observation that, by and large, intellectuals have lost interest in “transforming the whole of a way of life” to the fact that they play an increasingly prominent role in running the Welfare State; he does not relate their general satisfaction with the Welfare State to the fact that, as he observes elsewhere, “America has become an affluent society, offering place…and prestige…to the onetime radicals.” Secondly, he offers no serious argument to show that intellectuals are somehow “right” or “objectively justified” in reaching the consensus to which he alludes, with its rejection of the notion that society should be transformed. Indeed, although Bell is fairly sharp about the empty rhetoric of the “new left,” he seems to have a quite utopian faith that technical experts will be able to cope with the few problems that still remain; for example, the fact that labor is treated as a commodity, and the problems of “alienation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems fairly obvious that the classical problems are very much with us; one might plausibly argue that they have even been enhanced in severity and scale. For example, the classical paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty is now an ever-increasing problem on an international scale. Whereas one might conceive, at least in principle, of a solution within national boundaries, a sensible idea of transforming international society to cope with vast and perhaps increasing human misery is hardly likely to develop within the framework of the intellectual consensus that Bell describes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THUS IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL to describe the consensus of Bell’s intellectuals in somewhat different terms from his. Using the terminology of the first part of his essay, we might say that the Welfare State technician finds justification for his special and prominent social status in his “science,” specifically, in the claim that social science can support a technology of social tinkering on a domestic or international scale. He then takes a further step, ascribing in a familiar way a universal validity to what is in fact a class interest: he argues that the special conditions on which his claim to power and authority are based are, in fact, the only general conditions by which modern society can be saved; that social tinkering within a Welfare State framework must replace the commitment to the “total ideologies” of the past, ideologies which were concerned with a transformation of society. Having found his position of power, having achieved security and affluence, he has no further need for ideologies that look to radical change. The scholar-expert replaces the “free-floating intellectual” who “felt that the wrong values were being honored, and rejected the society,” and who has now lost his political role (now, that is, that the right values are being honored).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conceivably, it is correct that the technical experts who will (or hope to) manage the “industrial society” will be able to cope with the classical problems without a radical transformation of society. It is conceivably true that the bourgeoisie was right in regarding the special conditions of its emancipation as the only general conditions by which modern society would be saved. In either case, an argument is in order, and skepticism is justified when none appears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the same framework of general utopianism, Bell goes on to pose the issue between Welfare State scholar-experts and third-world ideologists in a rather curious way. He points out, quite correctly, that there is no issue of Communism, the content of that doctrine having been “long forgotten by friends and foes alike.” Rather, he says,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the question is an older one: whether new societies can grow by building democratic institutions and allowing people to make choices—and sacrifices—voluntarily, or whether the new elites, heady with power, will impose totalitarian means to transform their societies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE QUESTION is an interesting one. It is odd, however, to see it referred to as “an older one.” Surely he cannot be suggesting that the West chose the democratic way—for example, that in England during the industrial revolution, the farmers voluntarily made the choice of leaving the land, giving up cottage industry, becoming an industrial proletariat, and voluntarily decided, within the framework of the existing democratic institutions, to make the sacrifices that are graphically described in the classic literature on nineteenth-century industrial society. One may debate the question whether authoritarian control is necessary to permit capital accumulation in the underdeveloped world, but the Western model of development is hardly one that we can point to with any pride. It is perhaps not surprising to find Walt Rostow referring to “the more humane processes [of industrialization] that Western values would suggest” (An American Policy in Asia). Those who have a serious concern for the problems that face backward countries, and for the role that advanced industrial societies might, in principle, play in development and modernization, must use somewhat more care in interpreting the significance of the Western experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Returning to the quite appropriate question, whether “new societies can grow by building democratic institutions” or only by totalitarian means, I think that honesty requires us to recognize that this question must be directed more to American intellectuals than to third-world ideologists. The backward countries have incredible, perhaps insurmountable problems, and few available options; the United States has a wide range of options, and has the economic and technological resources, though, evidently, neither the intellectual nor moral resources, to confront at least some of these problems. It is easy for an American intellectual to deliver homilies on the virtues of freedom and liberty, but if he is really concerned about, say, Chinese totalitarianism or the burdens imposed on the Chinese peasantry in forced industrialization, then he should face a task that is infinitely more important and challenging—the task of creating, in the United States, the intellectual and moral climate, as well as the social and economic conditions, that would permit this country to participate in modernization and development in a way commensurate with its material wealth and technical capacity. Large capital gifts to Cuba and China might not succeed in alleviating the authoritarianism and terror that tend to accompany early stages of capital accumulation, but they are far more likely to have this effect than lectures on democratic values. It is possible that even without “capitalist encirclement” in its various manifestations, the truly democratic elements in revolutionary movements—in some instances, soviets and collectives—might be undermined by an “elite” of bureaucrats and technical intelligentsia. But it is almost certain that capitalist encirclement itself, which all revolutionary movements now have to face, will guarantee this result. The lesson, for those who are concerned to strengthen the democratic, spontaneous, and popular elements in developing societies, is quite clear. Lectures on the two-party system, or even on the really substantial democratic values that have been in part realized in Western society, are a monstrous irrelevance, given the effort required to raise the level of culture in Western society to the point where it can provide a “social lever” for both economic development and the development of true democratic institutions in the third world—and, for that matter, at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A GOOD CASE CAN BE MADE for the conclusion that there is indeed something of a consensus among intellectuals who have already achieved power and affluence, or who sense that they can achieve them by “accepting society” as it is and promoting the values that are “being honored” in this society. It is also true that this consensus is most noticeable among the scholar-experts who are replacing the free-floating intellectuals of the past. In the university, these scholar-experts construct a “value-free technology” for the solution of technical problems that arise in contemporary society,20 taking a “responsible stance” towards these problems, in the sense noted earlier. This consensus among the responsible scholar-experts is the domestic analogue to that proposed, internationally, by those who justify the application of American power in Asia, whatever the human cost, on the grounds that it is necessary to contain the “expansion of China” (an “expansion” which is, to be sure, hypothetical for the time being)21—that is, to translate from State Department Newspeak, on the grounds that it is essential to reverse the Asian nationalist revolutions or, at least, to prevent them from spreading. The analogy becomes clear when we look carefully at the ways in which this proposal is formulated. With his usual lucidity, Churchill outlined the general position in a remark to his colleague of the moment, Joseph Stalin, at Teheran in 1943:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The government of the world must be entrusted to satisfied nations, who wished nothing more for themselves than what they had. If the world-government were in the hands of hungry nations there would always be danger. But none of us had any reason to seek for anything more…. Our power placed us above the rest. We were like the rich men dwelling at peace within their habitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a translation of Churchill’s biblical rhetoric into the jargon of contemporary social science, one may turn to the testimony of Charles Wolf, Senior Economist of the Rand Corporation, at the Congressional Committee Hearings cited earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am dubious that China’s fears of encirclement are going to be abated, eased, relaxed in the long-term future. But I would hope that what we do in Southeast Asia would help to develop within the Chinese body politic more of a realism and willingness to live with this fear than to indulge it by support for liberation movements, which admittedly depend on a great deal more than external support…the operational question for American foreign policy is not whether that fear can be eliminated or substantially alleviated, but whether China can be faced with a structure of incentives, of penalties and rewards, of inducements that will make it willing to live with this fear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is further clarified by Thomas Schelling: “There is growing experience, which the Chinese can profit from, that although the United States may be interested in encircling them, may be interested in defending nearby areas from them, it is, nevertheless, prepared to behave peaceably if they are.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, we are prepared to live peaceably in our—to be sure, rather extensive—habitations. And, quite naturally, we are offended by the undignified noises from the servants’ quarters. If, let us say, a peasant-based revolutionary movement tries to achieve independence from foreign powers and the domestic structures they support, or if the Chinese irrationally refuse to respond properly to the schedule of reinforcement that we have prepared for them—if they object to being encircled by the benign and peace-loving “rich men” who control the territories on their borders as a natural right—then, evidently, we must respond to this belligerence with appropriate force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT IS THIS MENTALITY that explains the frankness with which the United States Government and its academic apologists defend the American refusal to permit a political settlement in Vietnam at a local level, a settlement based on the actual distribution of political forces. Even government experts freely admit that the NLF is the only “truly mass-based political party in South Vietnam”22 ; that the NLF had “made a conscious and massive effort to extend political participation, even if it was manipulated, on the local level so as to involve the people in a self-contained, self-supporting revolution” (p. 374); and that this effort had been so successful that no political groups, “with the possible exception of the Buddhists, thought themselves equal in size and power to risk entering into a coalition, fearing that if they did the whale would swallow the minnow” (p. 362). Moreover, they concede that until the introduction of overwhelming American force, the NLF had insisted that the struggle “should be fought out at the political level and that the use of massed military might was in itself illegitimate…. The battleground was to be the minds and loyalties of the rural Vietnamese, the weapons were to be ideas” (pp. 91-92; cf. also pp. 93, 99-108, 155f.); and, correspondingly, that until mid-1964, aid from Hanoi “was largely confined to two areas—doctrinal know-how and leadership personnel” (p. 321). Captured NLF documents contrast the enemy’s “military superiority” with their own “political superiority” (p. 106), thus fully confirming the analysis of American military spokesmen who define our problem as how, “with considerable armed force but little political power, [to] contain an adversary who has enormous political force but only modest military power.”23&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the most striking outcome of both the Honolulu conference in February and the Manila conference in October was the frank admission by high officials of the Saigon government that “they could not survive a ‘peaceful settlement’ that left the Vietcong political structure in place even if the Vietcong guerilla units were disbanded,” that “they are not able to compete politically with the Vietnamese Communists” (Charles Mohr, New York Times, February 11, 1966, italics mine). Thus, Mohr continues, the Vietnamese demand a “pacification program” which will have as “its core…the destruction of the clandestine Vietcong political structure and the creation of an iron-like system of government political control over the population.” And from Manila, the same correspondent, on October 23, quotes a high South Vietnamese official as saying that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Frankly, we are not strong enough now to compete with the Communists on a purely political basis. They are organized and disciplined. The non-Communist nationalists are not—we do not have any large, well-organized political parties and we do not yet have unity. We cannot leave the Vietcong in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officials in Washington understand the situation very well. Thus Secretary Rusk has pointed out that “if the Vietcong come to the conference table as full partners they will, in a sense, have been victorious in the very aims that South Vietnam and the United States are pledged to prevent” (January 28, 1966). Max Frankel reported from Washington in the Times on February 18, 1966, that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Compromise has had no appeal here because the Administration concluded long ago that the non-Communist forces of South Vietnam could not long survive in a Saigon coalition with Communists. It is for that reason—and not because of an excessively rigid sense of protocol—that Washington has steadfastly refused to deal with the Vietcong or recognize them as an independent political force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, we will—magnanimously—permit Vietcong representatives to attend negotiations only if they will agree to identify themselves as agents of a foreign power and thus forfeit the right to participate in a coalition government, a right which they have now been demanding for a half-dozen years. We well know that in any representative coalition, our chosen delegates could not last a day without the support of American arms. Therefore, we must increase American force and resist meaningful negotiations, until the day when a client government can exert both military and political control over its own population—a day which may never dawn, for as William Bundy has pointed out, we could never be sure of the security of a Southeast Asia “from which the Western presence was effectively withdrawn.” Thus if we were to “negotiate in the direction of solutions that are put under the label of neutralization,” this would amount to capitulation to the Communists.24 According to this reasoning, then, South Vietnam must remain, permanently, an American military base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this is, of course, reasonable, so long as we accept the fundamental political axiom that the United States, with its traditional concern for the rights of the weak and downtrodden, and with its unique insight into the proper mode of development for backward countries, must have the courage and the persistence to impose its will by force until such time as other nations are prepared to accept these truths—or simply, to abandon hope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IF IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY of the intellectual to insist upon the truth, it is also his duty to see events in their historical perspective. Thus one must applaud the insistence of the Secretary of State on the importance of historical analogies, the Munich analogy, for example. As Munich showed, a powerful and aggressive nation with a fanatic belief in its manifest destiny will regard each victory, each extension of its power and authority, as a prelude to the next step. The matter was very well put by Adlai Stevenson, when he spoke of “the old, old route whereby expansive powers push at more and more doors, believing they will open until, at the ultimate door, resistance is unavoidable and major war breaks out.” Herein lies the danger of appeasement, as the Chinese tirelessly point out to the Soviet Union—which, they claim, is playing Chamberlain to our Hitler in Vietnam. Of course, the aggressiveness of liberal imperialism is not that of Nazi Germany, though the distinction may seem academic to a Vietnamese peasant who is being gassed or incinerated. We do not want to occupy Asia; we merely wish, to return to Mr. Wolf, “to help the Asian countries progress toward economic modernization, as relatively ‘open’ and stable societies, to which our access, as a country and as individual citizens, is free and comfortable.” The formulation is appropriate. Recent history shows that it makes little difference to us what form of government a country has so long as it remains an “open society,” in our peculiar sense of this term—that is, a society that remains open to American economic penetration or political control. If it is necessary to approach genocide in Vietnam to achieve this objective, than this is the price we must pay in defense of freedom and the rights of man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In pursuing the aim of helping other countries to progress toward open societies, with no thought of territorial aggrandizement, we are breaking no new ground. In the Congressional Hearings that I cited earlier, Hans Morgenthau aptly describes our traditional policy towards China as one which favors “what you might call freedom of competition with regard to the exploitation of China” (op. cit., p. 128). In fact, few imperialist powers have had explicit territorial ambitions. Thus in 1784, the British Parliament announced: “To pursue schemes of conquest and extension of dominion in India are measures repugnant to the wish, honor, and policy of this nation.” Shortly after this, the conquest of India was in full swing. A century later, Britain announced its intentions in Egypt under the slogan “intervention, reform, withdrawal.” It is obvious which parts of this promise were fulfilled within the next half-century. In 1936, on the eve of hostilities in North China, the Japanese stated their Basic Principles of National Policy. These included the use of moderate and peaceful means to extend her strength, to promote social and economic development, to eradicate the menace of Communism, to correct the aggressive policies of the great powers, and to secure her position as the stabilizing power in East Asia. Even in 1937, the Japanese government had “no territorial designs upon China.” In short, we follow a well-trodden path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is useful to remember, incidentally, that the US was apparently quite willing, as late as 1939, to negotiate a commercial treaty with Japan and arrive at a modus vivendi if Japan would “change her attitude and practice towards our rights and interests in China,” as Secretary Hull put it. The bombing of Chungking and the rape of Nanking were unpleasant, it is true, but what was really important was our rights and interests in China, as the responsible, unhysterical men of the day saw quite clearly. It was the closing of the open door by Japan that led inevitably to the Pacific war, just as it is the closing of the open door by “Communist” China itself that may very well lead to the next, and no doubt last, Pacific war.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QUITE OFTEN, THE STATEMENTS of sincere and devoted technical experts give surprising insight into the intellectual attitudes that lie in the background of the latest savagery. Consider, for example, the following comment by the economist Richard Lindholm, in 1959, expressing his frustration over the failure of economic development in “free Vietnam”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…the use of American aid is determined by how the Vietnamese use their incomes and their savings. The fact that a large portion of the Vietnamese imports financed with American aid are either consumer goods or raw materials used rather directly to meet consumer demands is an indication that the Vietnamese people desire these goods. for they have shown their desire by their willingness to use their piasters to purchase them.25&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, the Vietnamese people desire Buicks and air-conditioners, rather than sugar refining equipment or road-building machinery, as they have shown by their behavior in a free market. And however much we may deplore their free choice, we must allow the people to have their way. Of course, there are also those two-legged beasts of burden that one stumbles on in the countryside, but as any graduate student of political science can explain, they are not part of a responsible modernizing elite, and therefore have only a superficial biological resemblance to the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In no small measure, it is attitudes like this that lie behind the butchery in Vietnam, and we had better face up to them with candor, or we will find our government leading us towards a “final solution” in Vietnam, and in the many Vietnams that inevitably lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me finally return to Dwight Macdonald and the responsibility of intellectuals. Macdonald quotes an interview with a death-camp paymaster who burst into tears when told that the Russians would hang him. “Why should they? What have I done?” he asked. Macdonald concludes: “Only those who are willing to resist authority themselves when it conflicts too intolerably with their personal moral code, only they have the right to condemn the death-camp paymaster.” The question, “What have I done?” is one that we may well ask ourselves, as we read each day of fresh atrocities in Vietnam—as we create, or mouth, or tolerate the deceptions that will be used to justify the next defense of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Issue&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;February 23, 1967&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 1 &lt;p&gt;Such a research project has now been undertaken and published as a “Citizens’ White Paper”: F. Schurmann, P. D. Scott, R. Zelnik, The Politics of Escalation in Vietnam, Fawcett World Library, and Beacon Press, 1966. For further evidence of American rejection of UN initiatives for diplomatic settlement, just prior to the major escalation of February, 1965, see Mario Rossi, “The US Rebuff to U Thant,” NYR, November 17, 1966. There is further documentary evidence of NLF attempts to establish a coalition government and to neutralize the area, all rejected by the United States and its Saigon ally, in Douglas Pike, Viet Cong, M.I.T. Press, 1966. In reading material of this latter sort one must be especially careful to distinguish between the evidence presented and the “conclusions” that are asserted, for reasons noted briefly below (see note 22).&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 2 &lt;p&gt;At other times, Schlesinger does indeed display admirable scholarly caution. For example, in his Introduction to The Politics of Escalation he admits that there may have been “flickers of interest in negotiations” on the part of Hanoi. As to the Administration’s lies about negotiations and its repeated actions undercutting tentative initiatives towards negotiations, he comments only that the authors may have underestimated military necessity and that future historians may prove them wrong. This caution and detachment must be compared with Schlesinger’s attitude toward renewed study of the origins of the cold war: in a letter to the New York Review of Books, October 20, 1966, he remarks that it is time to “blow the whistle” on revisionist attempts to show that the cold war may have been the consequence of something more than mere Communist belligerence. We are to believe, then, that the relatively straight-forward matter of the origins of the cold war is settled beyond discussion, whereas the much more complex issue of why the United States shies away from a negotiated settlement in Vietnam must be left to future historians to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 6 &lt;p&gt;Cf. Jean Lacouture, Vietnam between Two Truces, Random House, 1966, p. 21. Diem’s analysis of the situation was shared by Western observers at the time. See, for example, the comments of William Henderson, Far Eastern specialist and executive, Council on Foreign Relations, in R. W. Lindholm, ed., Vietnam: The First Five Years, Michigan State, 1959. He notes “the growing alienation of the intelligentsia,” “the renewal of armed dissidence in the South,” the fact that “security has noticeably deteriorated in the last two years,” all as a result of Diem’s “grim dictatorship,” and predicts “a steady worsening of the political climate in free Vietnam, culminating in unforeseen disasters.”&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 7 &lt;p&gt;See Bernard Fall, “Vietnam in the Balance,” Foreign Affairs, October, 1966.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 8 &lt;p&gt;Stalin was neither pleased by the Titoist tendencies inside the Greek Communist party, nor by the possibility that a Balkan federation might develop under Titoist leadership. It is, nevertheless, conceivable that Stalin supported the Greek guerrillas at some stage of the rebellion, in spite of the difficulty of obtaining firm documentary evidence. Needless to say, no elaborate study is necessary to document the British or American role in this civil conflict, from late 1944. See D. G. Kousoulas, The Price of Freedom, Syracuse, 1953; Revolution and Defeat, Oxford, 1965, for serious study of these events from a strongly anti-Communist point of view.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 9 &lt;p&gt;For a detailed account, see James Warburg, Germany: Key to Peace, Harvard, 1953, p. 189f. Warburg concludes that apparently “the Kremlin was now prepared to accept the creation of an All-German democracy in the Western sense of that word,” whereas the Western powers, in their response, “frankly admitted their plan ‘to secure the participation of Germany in a purely defensive European community’ ” (i.e., nato).&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 10 &lt;p&gt;United States and the World Arena, pp. 344-45. Incidentally, those who quite rightly deplore the brutal suppression of the East German and Hungarian revolutions would do well to remember that these scandalous events might have been avoided had the United States been willing to consider proposals for neutralization of Central Europe. Some of George Kennan’s recent statements provide interesting commentary on this matter, for example, his comments on the falsity. from the outset, of the assumption that the USSR intended to attack or intimidate by force the Western half of the continent and that it was deterred by American force, and his remarks on the sterility and general absurdity of the demand for unilateral Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Germany together with “the inclusion of a united Germany as as a major component in a Western defense system based primarily on nuclear weaponry” (Pacem in Terris, E. Reed, ed., Pocket Books, 1965).&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 12 &lt;p&gt;New York Times Book Review, November 20, 1966. Such comments call to mind the remarkable spectacle of President Kennedy counseling Cheddi Jagan on the dangers of entering into a trading relationship “which brought a country into a condition of economic dependence.” The reference, of course, is to the dangers in commercial relations with the Soviet Union. See Schlesinger, A Thousand Days, p. 776.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 13 &lt;p&gt;A Thousand Days, p. 252.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 14 &lt;p&gt;Though this too is imprecise. One must recall the real character of the Trujillo regime to appreciate the full cynicism of Kennedy’s “realistic” analysis.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 16 &lt;p&gt;American private enterprise, of course, has its own ideas as to how India’s problems are to be met. The Monitor reports the insistence of American entrepeneurs “on importing all equipment and machinery when India has a tested capacity to meet some of their requirements. They have insisted on importing liquid ammonia, a basic raw material, rather than using indigenous naptha which is abundantly available. They have laid down restrictions about pricing, distribution, profits, and management control.”&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 17 &lt;p&gt;Although, to maintain perspective, we should recall that in his wildest moments, Alfred Rosenberg spoke of the elimination of thirty million Slavs, not the imposition of mass starvation on a quarter of the human race. Incidentally, the analogy drawn here is highly “irresponsible,” in the technical sense of this neologism discussed earlier. That is, it is based on the assumption that statements and actions of Americans are subject to the same standards and open to the same interpretations as those of anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 18 &lt;p&gt;The New York Times, February 6, 1966. Goldberg continues, the United States is not certain that all of these are voluntary adherents. This is not the first such demonstration of Communist duplicity. Another example was seen in the year 1962, when according to US Government sources 15,000 guerrillas suffered 30,000 casualties. See Arthur Schlesinger, A Thousand Days, p. 982.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 19 &lt;p&gt;Reprinted in a collection of essays, The End of Ideology: on the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties, Free Press, 1960. I have no intention here of entering into the full range of issues that have been raised in the discussion of “end of ideology” for the past dozen years. It is difficult to see how a rational person could quarrel with many of the theses that have been put forth, e.g., that at a certain historical moment the “politics of civility” is appropriate and, perhaps, efficacious; that one who advocates action (or inaction) has a responsibility to assess its social cost; that dogmatic fanaticism and “secular religions” should be combated (or if possible, ignored); that technical solutions to problems should be implemented, where possible; that “le dogmatisme idéologique devait disparaître pour que les idées reprissent vie” (Aron), and so on. Since this is sometimes taken to be an expression of an “anti-Marxist” position, it is worth keeping in mind that such sentiments as these have no bearing on non-Bolshevik Marxism, as represented, for example, by such figures as Luxemburg, Pannekoek, Korsch, Arthur Rosenberg, and others.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 20 &lt;p&gt;The extent to which this “technology” is value-free is hardly very important, given the clear commitments of those who apply it. The problems with which research is concerned are those posed by the Pentagon or the great corporations, not, say, by the revolutionaries of Northeast Brazil or by SNCC. Nor am I aware of a research project devoted to the problem of how poorly armed guerrillas might more effectively resist a brutal and devastating military technology—surely the kind of problem that would have interested the free-floating intellectual who is now hopelessly out of date.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 21 &lt;p&gt;In view of the unremitting propaganda barrage on “Chinese expansion,” perhaps a word of comment is in order. Typical of American propaganda on this subject is Adlai Stevenson’s assessment, shortly before his death (cf. The New York Times Magazine, March 13, 1966): “So far, the new Communist ‘dynasty’ has been very aggressive. Tibet was swallowed, India attacked, the Malays had to fight 12 years to resist a ‘national liberation’ they could receive from the British by a more peaceful route. Today, the apparatus of infiltration and aggression is already at work in North Thailand.”&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 22 &lt;p&gt;Douglas Pike, op. cit., p. 110. This book, written by a foreign service officer working at the Center for International Studies, M.I.T., poses a contrast between our side, which sympathizes with “the usual revolutionary stirrings around the world because they reflect inadequate living standards or oppressive and corrupt governments,” and the backers of “revolutionary guerrilla warfare,” which “opposes the aspirations of people while apparently furthering them, manipulates the individual by persuading him to manipulate himself.” Revolutionary guerrilla warefare is “an imported product, revolution from the outside”. (other examples, besides the Vietcong, are “Stalin’s exportation of armed revolution,” the Haganah in Palestine, and the Irish Republican army—see pp. 32-33). The Vietcong could not be an indigenous movement since it had “a social construction program of such scope and ambition that of necessity it must have been created in Hanoi” (p. 76—but on pp. 77-79 we read that “organizational activity had gone on intensively and systematically for several years” before the Lao Dong party in Hanoi had made its decision “to begin building an organization”). On page 80 we find “such an effort had to be the child of the North,” even though elsewhere we read of the prominent role of the Cao Dai (p. 74), “the first major social group to begin actively opposing the Diem government” (p. 222), and of the Hoa Hao sect, “another early and major participant in the NLF” (p. 69). He takes it as proof of Communist duplicity that in the South, the party insisted it was “Marxist-Leninist,” thus “indicating philosophic but not political allegiance,” whereas in the North it described itself as a “Marxist-Leninist organization,” thus “indicating that it was int he mainstream of the world-wide Communist movement” (p. 150). And so on. Also revealing is the contempt for “Cinderella and all the other fools [who] could still believe there was magic in the mature world if one mumbled the secret incantation: solidarity, union, concord”; for the “gullible, misled people” who were “turning the countryside into a bedlam toppling one Saigon government after another, confounding the Americans”; for the “mighty force of people” who in their mindless innocence thought that “the meek, at last, were to inherit the earth,” that “riches would be theirs and all in the name of justice and virtue.” One can appreciate the chagrin with which a sophisticated Western political scientist must view this “sad and awesome spectacle.”&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; 23 &lt;p&gt;Lacouture, op. cit., p. 188. The same military spokesman goes on, ominously, to say that this is the problem confronting us throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and that we must find the “proper response” to it.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok’s future in the US has reached a major milestone today, as the new US-owned spinoff for American users has officially launched. Here’s what that means for TikTok users in the US today, and moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;US ownership established for TikTok’s American spinoff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One year ago, and very briefly, TikTok shut down in the US. The move was made in compliance with legislation requiring the China-based company sell to American ownership or cease operating in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very quickly though, a series of executive orders ultimately led to TikTok being restored as a process was worked out for the service to keep operating in the US under American ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, the “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” has been formally established as that new ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC has been established in compliance with the Executive Order signed by President Trump on September 25, 2025, now enabling more than 200 million Americans and 7.5 million businesses to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience. The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One question on many US TikTok users’ minds is what this means for the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous reporting said that TikTok’s algorithm would be retrained “from the ground up” by its new ownership. And that’s been confirmed in the press release, along with mentions of other behind-the-scenes changes to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the new TikTok ownership plans to change&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s everything that the new US-owned TikTok spinoff plans to do, per the press release:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Protection: U.S. user data will be protected by USDS Joint Venture in Oracle’s secure U.S. cloud environment. The Joint Venture will operate a comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity program that is audited and certified by third party cybersecurity experts. The program will adhere to major industry standards, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) CSF and 800-53 and ISO 27001 as well as the Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Security Requirements for Restricted Transactions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Algorithm Security: The Joint Venture will retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data. The content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle’s U.S. cloud environment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Software Assurance: The Joint Venture will secure U.S. apps through software assurance protocols, and review and validate source code on an ongoing basis, assisted by its Trusted Security Partner, Oracle.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trust &amp;amp; Safety: The Joint Venture will safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem and have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the above paragraphs make clear, much of what’s changing will happen behind the scenes. The new US company will be responsible for ensuring the privacy and security of its users, but that likely won’t come with visible changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, one big area TikTok is expected to change involves the content users see. That’s because the new company will “retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This change could potentially lead to more relevant recommendations for US users, but it’s also very possible the opposite will happen and the app’s quality will reduce over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are you expecting will change with TikTok under new US ownership? Let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
