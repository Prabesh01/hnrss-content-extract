    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Kagi News&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive daily press review with global news. Fully private, with sources openly curated by our community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News is broken. We all know it, but we’ve somehow accepted it as inevitable. The endless notifications. The clickbait headlines designed to trigger rather than inform, driven by relentless ad monetization. The exhausting cycle of checking multiple apps throughout the day, only to feel more anxious and less informed than when we started. This isn’t what news was supposed to be. We can do better, and create what news should have been all along: pure, essential information that respects your intelligence and time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our approach: Signal over noise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kagi News operates on a simple principle: understanding the world requires hearing from the world. Every day, our system reads thousands of community curated RSS feeds from publications across different viewpoints and perspectives. We then use AI to distill this massive information into one comprehensive daily briefing, while clearly citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We strive for diversity and transparency of resources and welcome your contributions to widen perspectives. This multi-source approach helps reveal the full picture beyond any single viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design principles that put readers first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One daily update: We publish once per day around noon UTC, creating a natural endpoint to news consumption. This is a deliberate design choice that turns news from an endless habit into a contained ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five-minute complete understanding: Our briefings cover everything important in just five minutes. No endless scrolling. No attention hijacking. You read, understand, and move on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversity over echo chambers: Rather than personalizing feeds to match existing preferences, we expose readers to the full spectrum of global perspectives. This approach breaks down information silos instead of reinforcing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy by design: Your reading habits belong to you. We don’t track, profile, or monetize your attention. You remain the customer and not the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Community-driven sources: Our news sources are open source and community-curated through our public GitHub repository. Anyone can propose additions, flag problems, or suggest improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customizable: In your settings, you can select and reorder categories to match your interests and priorities. You can also adjust the number of stories shown, as well as dragging to re-order various sections, so that your briefing is focused on the depth and topics that matter most to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News in your language: You can choose your preferred interface and content language. News stories are generated in their original source language, and then translated using Kagi Translate. The default mode shows regional stories in their original language without translation, and all other ones in your browser’s language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical implementation that respects publishers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t scrape content from websites. Instead, we use publicly available RSS feeds that publishers choose to provide. Publishers decide what content appears in their feeds; some include full articles, others only titles or summaries. We respect those choices completely. We’re working within the ecosystem publishers have created rather than circumventing their intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ready to experience news differently?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re tired of news that makes you feel worse about the world while teaching you less about it, we invite you to try a different approach with Kagi News, so download it today:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing agentic loops&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30th September 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents like Anthropic’s Claude Code and OpenAI’s Codex CLI represent a genuine step change in how useful LLMs can be for producing working code. These agents can now directly exercise the code they are writing, correct errors, dig through existing implementation details, and even run experiments to find effective code solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is so often the case with modern AI, there is a great deal of depth involved in unlocking the full potential of these new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical new skill to develop is designing agentic loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to think about coding agents is that they are brute force tools for finding solutions to coding problems. If you can reduce your problem to a clear goal and a set of tools that can iterate towards that goal a coding agent can often brute force its way to an effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My preferred definition of an LLM agent is something that runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal. The art of using them well is to carefully design the tools and loop for them to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The joy of YOLO mode&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Picking the right tools for the loop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issuing tightly scoped credentials&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When to design an agentic loop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is still a very fresh area&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The joy of YOLO mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are inherently dangerous—they can make poor decisions or fall victim to malicious prompt injection attacks, either of which can result in harmful results from tool calls. Since the most powerful coding agent tool is “run this command in the shell” a rogue agent can do anything that you could do by running a command yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An AI agent is an LLM wrecking its environment in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents like Claude Code counter this by defaulting to asking you for approval of almost every command that they run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is kind of tedious, but more importantly, it dramatically reduces their effectiveness at solving problems through brute force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these tools provides its own version of what I like to call YOLO mode, where everything gets approved by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so dangerous, but it’s also key to getting the most productive results!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three key risks to consider from unattended YOLO mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bad shell commands deleting or mangling things you care about.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exfiltration attacks where something steals files or data visible to the agent—source code or secrets held in environment variables are particularly vulnerable here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attacks that use your machine as a proxy to attack another target—for DDoS or to disguise the source of other hacking attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to run YOLO mode anyway, you have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run your agent in a secure sandbox that restricts the files and secrets it can access and the network connections it can make.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use someone else’s computer. That way if your agent goes rogue, there’s only so much damage they can do, including wasting someone else’s CPU cycles.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Take a risk! Try to avoid exposing it to potential sources of malicious instructions and hope you catch any mistakes before they cause any damage.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people choose option 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the existence of container escapes I think option 1 using Docker or the new Apple container tool is a reasonable risk to accept for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Option 2 is my favorite. I like to use GitHub Codespaces for this—it provides a full container environment on-demand that’s accessible through your browser and has a generous free tier too. If anything goes wrong it’s a Microsoft Azure machine somewhere that’s burning CPU and the worst that can happen is code you checked out into the environment might be exfiltrated by an attacker, or bad code might be pushed to the attached GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other agent-like tools that run code on other people’s computers. Code Interpreter mode in both ChatGPT and Claude can go a surprisingly long way here. I’ve also had a lot of success (ab)using OpenAI’s Codex Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding agents themselves implement various levels of sandboxing, but so far I’ve not seen convincing enough documentation of these to trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: It turns out Anthropic have their own documentation on Safe YOLO mode for Claude Code which says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting Claude run arbitrary commands is risky and can result in data loss, system corruption, or even data exfiltration (e.g., via prompt injection attacks). To minimize these risks, use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt;in a container without internet access. You can follow this reference implementation using Docker Dev Containers.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locking internet access down to a list of trusted hosts is a great way to prevent exfiltration attacks from stealing your private source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Picking the right tools for the loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve found a safe (enough) way to run in YOLO mode, the next step is to decide which tools we need to make available to the coding agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can bring MCP into the mix at this point, but I find it’s usually more productive to think in terms of shell commands instead. Coding agents are really good at running shell commands!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your environment allows them the necessary network access, they can also pull down additional packages from NPM and PyPI and similar. Ensuring your agent runs in an environment where random package installs don’t break things on your main computer is an important consideration as well!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than leaning on MCP, I like to create an AGENTS.md (or equivalent) file with details of packages I think they may need to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a project that involved taking screenshots of various websites I installed my own shot-scraper CLI tool and dropped the following in &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;To take a screenshot, run:

shot-scraper http://www.example.com/ -w 800 -o example.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just that one example is enough for the agent to guess how to swap out the URL and filename for other screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good LLMs already know how to use a bewildering array of existing tools. If you say "use playwright python" or "use ffmpeg" most models will use those effectively—and since they’re running in a loop they can usually recover from mistakes they make at first and figure out the right incantations without extra guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Issuing tightly scoped credentials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to exposing the right commands, we also need to consider what credentials we should expose to those commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally we wouldn’t need any credentials at all—plenty of work can be done without signing into anything or providing an API key—but certain problems will require authenticated access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a deep topic in itself, but I have two key recommendations here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try to provide credentials to test or staging environments where any damage can be well contained.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a credential can spend money, set a tight budget limit.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll use an example to illustrate. A while ago I was investigating slow cold start times for a scale-to-zero application I was running on Fly.io.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realized I could work a lot faster if I gave Claude Code the ability to directly edit Dockerfiles, deploy them to a Fly account and measure how long they took to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fly allows you to create organizations, and you can set a budget limit for those organizations and issue a Fly API key that can only create or modify apps within that organization...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I created a dedicated organization for just this one investigation, set a $5 budget, issued an API key and set Claude Code loose on it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that particular case the results weren’t useful enough to describe in more detail, but this was the project where I first realized that “designing an agentic loop” was an important skill to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;When to design an agentic loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every problem responds well to this pattern of working. The thing to look out for here are problems with clear success criteria where finding a good solution is likely to involve (potentially slightly tedious) trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any time you find yourself thinking “ugh, I’m going to have to try a lot of variations here” is a strong signal that an agentic loop might be worth trying!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging: a test is failing and you need to investigate the root cause. Coding agents that can already run your tests can likely do this without any extra setup.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance optimization: this SQL query is too slow, would adding an index help? Have your agent benchmark the query and then add and drop indexes (in an isolated development environment!) to measure their impact.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrading dependencies: you’ve fallen behind on a bunch of dependency upgrades? If your test suite is solid an agentic loop can upgrade them all for you and make any minor updates needed to reflect breaking changes. Make sure a copy of the relevant release notes is available, or that the agent knows where to find them itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimizing container sizes: Docker container feeling uncomfortably large? Have your agent try different base images and iterate on the Dockerfile to try to shrink it, while keeping the tests passing.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common theme in all of these is automated tests. The value you can get from coding agents and other LLM coding tools is massively amplified by a good, cleanly passing test suite. Thankfully LLMs are great for accelerating the process of putting one of those together, if you don’t have one yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;This is still a very fresh area&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing agentic loops is a very new skill—Claude Code was first released in just February 2025!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that giving it a clear name can help us have productive conversations about it. There’s so much more to figure out about how to use these tools as effectively as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;cell&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt; Random Attractors&lt;lb/&gt; Found using Lyapunov Exponents &lt;/head&gt; Written by Paul Bourke&lt;lb/&gt; October 2001&lt;p&gt; Contribution by Philip Ham: attractor.basic&lt;lb/&gt; and Python implementation by Johan Bichel Lindegaard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This document is "littered" with a selection of attractors found using the techniques described. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In order for a system to exhibit chaotic behaviour it must be non linear. Representing chaotic systems on a screen or on paper leads one to considering a two dimensional system, an equation in two variables. One possible two dimensional non-linear system, the one used here, is the quadratic map defined as follows. &lt;/p&gt; xn+1 = a0 + a1 xn + a2 xn2 + a3 xn yn + a4 yn + a5 yn2 &lt;lb/&gt; yn+1 = b0 + b1 xn + b2 xn2 + b3 xn yn + b4 yn + b5 yn2 &lt;p&gt; The standard measure for determining whether or not a system is chaotic is the Lyapunov exponent, normally represented by the lambda symbol. Consider two close points at step n, xn and xn+dxn. At the next time step they will have diverged, namely to xn+1 and xn+1+dxn+1. It is this average rate of divergence (or convergence) that the Lyapunov exponent captures. Another way to think about the Lyapunov exponent is as the rate at which information about the initial conditions is lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are as many Lyapunov exponents as dimensions of the phase space. Considering a region (circle, sphere, hypersphere, etc) in phase space then at a later time all trajectories in this region form an n-dimensional elliptical region. The Lyapunov exponent can be calculated for each dimension. When talking about a single exponent one is normally referring to the largest, this convention will be assumed from now onwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Lyapunov exponent is positive then the system is chaotic and unstable. Nearby points will diverge irrespective of how close they are. Although there is no order the system is still deterministic! The magnitude of the Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity to initial conditions, the primary characteristic of a chaotic system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Lyapunov exponent is less than zero then the system attracts to a fixed point or stable periodic orbit. These systems are non conservative (dissipative). The absolute value of the exponent indicates the degree of stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Lyapunov exponent is zero then the system is neutrally stable, such systems are conservative and in a steady state mode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To create the chaotic attractors shown on this page each parameter an and bn in the quadratic equation above is chosen at random between some bounds (+- 2 say). The system so specified is generated by iterating for some suitably large number of time steps (eg; 100000) steps during which time the image is created and the Lyapunov exponent computed. Note that the first few (1000) timesteps are ignored to allow the system to settle into its "natural" behaviour. If the Lyapunov exponent indicates chaos then the image is saved and the program moves on to the next random parameter set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are a number of ways the series may behave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may converge to a single point, called a fixed point. These can be detected by comparing the distances between successive points. For numerical reasons this is safer than relying on the Lyapunov exponent which may be infinite (logarithm of 0)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may diverge to infinity, for the range (+- 2) used here for each parameter this is the most likely event. These are also easy to detect and discard, indeed they need to be in order to avoid numerical errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will form a periodic orbit, these are identified by their negative Lyapunov exponent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will exhibit chaos, filling in some region of the plane. These are the solutions that "look good" and the ones we wish to identify with the Lyapunov exponent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt; It should be noted that there may be visually appealing structures that are not chaotic attractors. That is, the resulting image is different for different initial conditions and there is no single basin of attraction. It's interesting how we "see" 3 dimensional structures in these essentially 2 dimensional systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software used to create these images is given here: gen.c. On average 98% of the random selections of (an, bn) result in an infinite series. This is so common because of the range (-2 &amp;lt;= a,b &amp;lt;= 2) for each of the parameters a and b, the number of infinite cases will reduce greatly with a smaller range. About 1% were point attractors, and about 0.5% were periodic basins of attraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt; Image courtesy of Robert McGregor, Space Coast of Florida.

    &lt;p&gt;Airweave is a tool that lets agents search any app. It connects to apps, productivity tools, databases, or document stores and transforms their contents into searchable knowledge bases, accessible through a standardized interface for agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search interface is exposed via REST API or MCP. When using MCP, Airweave essentially builds a semantically searchable MCP server. The platform handles everything from auth and extraction to embedding and serving.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sora 2 is here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our latest video generation model is more physically accurate, realistic, and more controllable than prior systems. It also features synchronized dialogue and sound effects. Create with it in the new Sora app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we’re releasing Sora 2, our flagship video and audio generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Sora model from February 2024 was in many ways the GPT‑1 moment for video—the first time video generation started to seem like it was working, and simple behaviors like object permanence emerged from scaling up pre-training compute. Since then, the Sora team has been focused on training models with more advanced world simulation capabilities. We believe such systems will be critical for training AI models that deeply understand the physical world. A major milestone for this is mastering pre-training and post-training on large-scale video data, which are in their infancy compared to language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Sora 2, we are jumping straight to what we think may be the GPT‑3.5 moment for video. Sora 2 can do things that are exceptionally difficult—and in some instances outright impossible—for prior video generation models: Olympic gymnastics routines, backflips on a paddleboard that accurately model the dynamics of buoyancy and rigidity, and triple axels while a cat holds on for dear life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior video models are overoptimistic—they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt. For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard. Interestingly, “mistakes” the model makes frequently appear to be mistakes of the internal agent that Sora 2 is implicitly modeling; though still imperfect, it is better about obeying the laws of physics compared to prior systems. This is an extremely important capability for any useful world simulator—you must be able to model failure, not just success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model is also a big leap forward in controllability, able to follow intricate instructions spanning multiple shots while accurately persisting world state. It excels at realistic, cinematic, and anime styles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a general purpose video-audio generation system, it is capable of creating sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also directly inject elements of the real world into Sora 2. For example, by observing a video of one of our teammates, the model can insert them into any Sora-generated environment with an accurate portrayal of appearance and voice. This capability is very general, and works for any human, animal or object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model is far from perfect and makes plenty of mistakes, but it is validation that further scaling up neural networks on video data will bring us closer to simulating reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the road to general-purpose simulation and AI systems that can function in the physical world, we think people can have a lot of fun with the models we’re building along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first started playing with this “upload yourself” feature several months ago on the Sora team, and we all had a blast with it. It kind of felt like a natural evolution of communication—from text messages to emojis to voice notes to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So today, we’re launching a new social iOS app just called “Sora,” powered by Sora 2. Inside the app, you can create, remix each other’s generations, discover new videos in a customizable Sora feed, and bring yourself or your friends in via cameos. With cameos, you can drop yourself straight into any Sora scene with remarkable fidelity after a short one-time video-and-audio recording in the app to verify your identity and capture your likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, we launched the app internally to all of OpenAI. We’ve already heard from our colleagues that they’re making new friends at the company because of the feature. We think a social app built around this “cameos” feature is the best way to experience the magic of Sora 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concerns about doomscrolling, addiction, isolation, and RL-sloptimized feeds are top of mind—here is what we are doing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are giving users the tools and optionality to be in control of what they see on the feed. Using OpenAI's existing large language models, we have developed a new class of recommender algorithms that can be instructed through natural language. We also have built-in mechanisms to periodically poll users on their wellbeing and proactively give them the option to adjust their feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, we show you content heavily biased towards people you follow or interact with, and prioritize videos that the model thinks you’re most likely to use as inspiration for your own creations. We are not optimizing for time spent in feed, and we explicitly designed the app to maximize creation, not consumption. You can find more details in our Feed Philosophy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This app is made to be used with your friends. Overwhelming feedback from testers is that cameos are what make this feel different and fun to use—you have to try it to really get it, but it is a new and unique way to communicate with people. We’re rolling this out as an invite-based app to make sure you come in with your friends. At a time when all major platforms are moving away from the social graph, we think cameos will reinforce community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protecting the wellbeing of teens is important to us. We are putting in default limits on how many generations teens can see per day in the feed, and we’re also rolling out with stricter permissions on cameos for this group. In addition to our automated safety stacks, we are scaling up teams of human moderators to quickly review cases of bullying if they arise. We are launching with Sora parental controls via ChatGPT so parents can override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithm personalization, as well as manage direct message settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With cameos, you are in control of your likeness end-to-end with Sora. Only you decide who can use your cameo, and you can revoke access or remove any video that includes it at any time. Videos containing cameos of you, including drafts created by other people, are viewable by you at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of safety topics we’ve tackled with this app—consent around use of likeness, provenance, preventing the generation of harmful content, and much more. See our Sora 2 Safety doc for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of problems with other apps stem from the monetization model incentivizing decisions that are at odds with user wellbeing. Transparently, our only current plan is to eventually give users the option to pay some amount to generate an extra video if there’s too much demand relative to available compute. As the app evolves, we will openly communicate any changes in our approach here, while continuing to keep user wellbeing as our main goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re at the beginning of this journey, but with all of the powerful ways to create and remix content with Sora 2, we see this as the beginning of a completely new era for co-creative experiences. We’re optimistic that this will be a healthier platform for entertainment and creativity compared to what is available right now. We hope you have a good time :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sora iOS app(opens in a new window) is available to download now. You can sign up in-app for a push notification when access opens for your account. We’re starting the initial rollout in the U.S. and Canada today with the intent to quickly expand to additional countries. After you’ve received an invite, you’ll also be able to access Sora 2 through sora.com(opens in a new window). Sora 2 will initially be available for free, with generous limits to start so people can freely explore its capabilities, though these are still subject to compute constraints. ChatGPT Pro users will also be able to use our experimental, higher quality Sora 2 Pro model on sora.com(opens in a new window) (and soon in the Sora app as well). We also plan to release Sora 2 in the API. Sora 1 Turbo will remain available, and everything you’ve created will continue to live in your sora.com(opens in a new window) library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video models are getting very good, very quickly. General-purpose world simulators and robotic agents will fundamentally reshape society and accelerate the arc of human progress. Sora 2 represents significant progress towards that goal. In keeping with OpenAI’s mission, it is important that humanity benefits from these models as they are developed. We think Sora is going to bring a lot of joy, creativity and connection to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation has long been known to double your risk of heart disease, but prior to now, inflammation has never been a SMuRF: standard modifiable risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The American College of Cardiology just released recommendations that change that. The ACC is now recommending that everyone measure inflammation (specifically, hs-CRP) via a blood test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Because clinicians will not treat what they do not measure, universal screening of hsCRP in both primary and secondary prevention patients, in combination with cholesterol, represents a major clinical opportunity and is therefore recommended. American College of Cardiology&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were many interesting bits of evidence that led to this recommendation. The whole article, published in JACC, is worth a read, but this blog post extracts a few of the most interesting parts — or at least, the parts I thought were most interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Inflammation (hs-CRP) is a stronger predictor of heart disease than cholesterol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, LDL cholesterol (or ApoB) has been the main focus of cardiovascular risk assessment. But this chart shows hs-CRP is actually a stronger predictor of heart disease than LDL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? In some ways, cholesterol has become a victim of its own success. We now screen the whole population for high cholesterol, give statins to those with high LDL (or ApoB), and so then the majority of people who end up having heart attacks have lower cholesterol than they would naturally have. This means most of the majority of residual risk for heart attacks will be found in biomarkers that aren’t SMuRFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inflammation (hs-CRP) is one such non-SMuRF, one perhaps one of the strongest. This is especially true in people already on statins or those without traditional risk factors (sometimes called “SMuRF-less” patients). In these groups, cholesterol may be well controlled, but inflammation remains a key driver of events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, other traditional risk factors matter in addition to inflammation: blood pressure, HbA1c or insulin resistance, eGFR (kidney function), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What can you actually do to lower inflammation?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACC consensus reviews a range of clinical trials testing both drugs and lifestyle interventions for lowering inflammation and reducing cardiovascular risk. Here’s a summary of the clinical trials and their results:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What works to lower inflammation?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Statins (especially in people with high hs-CRP): Substantial reduction in events, even when LDL is normal (JUPITER trial).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colchicine: Reduces recurrent events in people with established heart disease (COLCOT, LoDoCo2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Canakinumab: Reduces events but is expensive and increases infection risk (CANTOS).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lifestyle: Anti-inflammatory diets (Mediterranean, DASH), regular exercise, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight all lower hs-CRP and reduce risk.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What doesn’t work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some anti-inflammatory drugs (methotrexate, TNF inhibitors, corticosteroids) have not shown benefit in major trials.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s a normal, good, or bad hs-CRP?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve already measured your hs-CRP (great!), then it’s ideally below &amp;lt;1 mg/L. hs-CRP above 3 mg/L is high risk:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you’re in moderate or high ranges, see the section above for what to do.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are other biomarkers of inflammation relevant?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACC evaluated other markers: IL-6, fibrinogen, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, EPA/AA ratio, and serum amyloid A. These have also been shown to predict cardiovascular risk, but once hs-CRP is known, don’t add more signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, you’re best off simply measuring hs-CRP, and then spending money elsewhere on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other interesting bits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JACC article is packed with other interesting insights. These ones were interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Imaging biomarkers (like CT, PET, MRI, and perivascular “fat attenuation index”) can detect vascular inflammation and may help predict coronary events, but are not yet ready for routine clinical use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bempedoic acid is a newer cholesterol-lowering drug that also lowers hs-CRP, but its long-term outcomes are still being studied.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Residual inflammatory risk: Even with well-controlled LDL on statins, many people still have elevated hs-CRP and ongoing risk—so inflammation should be addressed separately from cholesterol.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Universal hs-CRP screening is now recommended by the ACC for both people with and without established heart disease.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) is now FDA-approved as an adjunct for secondary prevention in stable ASCVD, but should be avoided in people with significant kidney or liver disease.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Novel IL-6 inhibitors are being studied as future anti-inflammatory therapies for heart disease.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to measure your inflammation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple blood test for hs-CRP is widely available and inexpensive. The ACC now recommends routine hs-CRP testing for both people at risk (primary prevention) and those with established heart disease (secondary prevention).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I changed my Slack channel sections. I’m now more responsive and engaged, while also feeling less stressed. How? By sorting my Slack channels by urgency, or how often I want to read them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;What&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Projects&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Team&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Alerts&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sibling Teams&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Social&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Noisy&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Versus&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;How Often&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Now&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Hourly&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Daily&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Whenever&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorting by “how often” lets me read my most urgent messages first, focusing my energy on what matters to me. Once I feel tired, I stop reading. By focusing on my most urgent and important channels, I hold confidence that I have already taken care of what I need to, reducing my stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By framing a channel’s importance through the Eisenhower Matrix, I focus on how I contribute to channels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Urgent&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not Urgent&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Important&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Now / Read Hourly&lt;p&gt;I directly answer questions, engage in conversations frequently, or react to them in the real world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Whenever&lt;p&gt;I read announcements and keep up-to-date with changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not Important&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Daily&lt;p&gt;I can push the conversation along by forwarding it to different channels or tagging more appropriate people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Never&lt;p&gt;Reading and writing in these channels are meaningless to me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This framework is flexible. Your needs and availability will change. Projects go from active development to finished. Social channels go through ups and downs. As these changes happen, you can slide the channel between any category, and it’ll still make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Misprioritized channels are a source of burnout. Noisy channels in important sections waste time and hide the valuable signal. Important channels in noisy sections are missed opportunities. It’s clearest when you think of some sections like Office, Social, and Project. Intuitively, Project is important. Office is important, but maybe not? Social is less important, but I still want to live a happy life. Yet, I kept finding examples that don’t fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Read Hourly — I’m often answering questions to unblock other people&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Project channels where I’m a passive contributor to&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Project – High Priority&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read Daily or Read — I want to stay on top of announcements and changes, but I’m not actively contributing&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I conclude that organizing by “what” is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do we organize by “what”? I think because, by default, Slack suggests Priority, Team, Announcements, and Social, priming us for “what”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to categorize by “what”. It’s easy to explain, and it’s easy to have icons. But I don’t find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did I start categorizing by “how often”? Is a channel high or medium priority? Just guess. Your gut instinct is probably right. In the worst case, you’re wrong and you slide it up or down. If you’re deeply unsure, put it into Read Hourly or Read Now first. You’ll quickly know if it was the wrong decision. After a couple of wasted moments, slide them down a level. Repeat until the channel stops bothering you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been organizing my Slack by “how often” for almost a month now, and have successfully maintained Inbox Zero for Slack every day. Give it a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For software engineers, diffs are a ubiquitous method for representing changes: We use diffs to compare different versions of the same file (e.g., during code review or when trying to understand the history of a file), to visualize the difference of a failing test compared with its expectation, or to apply changes to source files automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every project I worked on professionally or privately eventually needed a diff to visualize a change or to apply a patch. However, I have never been satisfied with any of the freely available diff libraries. This was never really a problem professionally, but for private projects, I have copied and modified my own library from project to project until I mentioned this to a colleague who set me on the path to publish my Go library (a port of a previous C++ library I used to copy and modify). Boy, did I underestimate how close my library was to publishability!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I did it and I learned a whole lot about diff algorithms. You can find my library at znkr.io/diff and what I learned in this article. I am not finished learning yet, so I plan to update this article as my understanding continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Existing Diff Libraries&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me start by explaining why I am dissatisfied with existing diff libraries. There are a number of attributes that are important to me. Not all of these attributes are important for every use case, but a diff library that I can use for all of my use cases needs to fulfill all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, the input to a diff algorithm is text, and most diff libraries only support that. However, I occasionally have use cases where I need to compare things that are not text. So any diff library that only supports text doesn't meet my needs; instead, I need support for arbitrary sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting diff output is intended to be readable by humans. Quite often, especially for text, a good way to present a diff is in the unified format. However, it's not always the best presentation. A diff library should make it easy to output a diff in unified format, but it should also provide a way to customize the presentation by providing a structured result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the presentation, the content of a diff should make it easy for humans to understand the diff. This is a somewhat subjective criterion, but there are a number of failure cases that are easily avoided, and there's some research into diff readability to set a benchmark. On the other hand, diffs should be minimal in that they should be as small as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last but not least, it's important that a diff library has a simple API and provides good performance in both runtime and memory usage, even in worst-case scenarios1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, we can evaluate existing diff libraries. For Go, I went through a number of libraries and summarized them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Name&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Output&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;API&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Performance2&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;➖&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;❌3&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;❌3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖➖➖ /🧨7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;mb0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😐8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖➖&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;udiff&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➖➖9&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way I assigned ➕ and ➖ in this table doesn't follow any scientific methodology it's merely based on running a few benchmarks and comparing a few results by hand. If you're looking for a diff library to fulfill your needs, I would like to encourage you to do your own comparisons. You can find the code I used for these comparisons in on github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results suggest that it's far from trivial to implement a good diff library, and the one I had started out with wasn't much better. To understand why the existing libraries are as they are, we need to take a peek into the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Complexity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the exception of go-internal, all libraries use Myers' Algorithm to compute the diff. This is a standard algorithm that returns a minimal diff and has been in use for this purpose for decades. The algorithm has a runtime complexity of where is the number of input elements and is the edit distance between the two inputs. This means that the algorithm is very fast for inputs that are similar, which is quite common. However, it's essentially quadratic in the worst case. That is, for inputs that are very different, the complexity approaches . Furthermore, the algorithm comes in two variants with a space complexity of either or . Only godebug uses the variant with quadratic memory growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that it's relatively easy to write a well-performing diffing algorithm for small or similar inputs, but it takes a very long time to complete for larger, less similar inputs. A consequence of this is that we can't trust simple benchmarks; instead, we need to test the worst-case scenario1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always in cases like this, we can improve the performance by approximating an optimal solution. There are a number of heuristics that reduce the time complexity by trading off diff minimality. For example, diffmatchpatch uses a deadline to stop the search for an optimal diff, and udiff uses a an extremely aggressive heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of improving Myers' runtime with heuristics, it's also often possible to find a diff using only heuristics. go-internal uses patience diff. The heuristic is good enough that it alone almost always results in a good diff with a runtime complexity of 10. An additional advantage of this algorithm is that it produces more readable diffs. However, patience diff can fail with very large diffs, and it can only be implemented efficiently using a hash table, which restricts the possible applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Histogram Diff&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides patience diff, there's another interesting heuristic called histogram diff. I still have to implement it and understand it better before writing about it here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Readability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diff algorithms usually find a minimal diff or an approximation of one. However, except for trivial cases, there are always multiple minimal diffs. For example, this simple diff&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;a
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;b
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;c
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;d
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is as minimal as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;a
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;c
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;b
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;d
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all of the minimal or near-minimal diffs have the same readability for humans. For example11,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we relax minimality to accept approximations, the number of possible results increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For good diff readability, we have to select one solution from the many possible ones that is readable for humans. Many people believe that the diff readability is determined by the algorithm. However, that's only partially correct, because different implementations of the same algorithm can produce vastly different results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also been a lot of progress in the past years to improve diff readability. Perhaps the best work about diff readability is diff-slider-tools by Michael Haggerty. He implemented a heuristic that's applied in a post-processing step to improve the readability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;code&gt;example_03.diff&lt;/code&gt; above was generated using this heuristic. The diff without the heuristic,
as generated by my implementation of Myers' linear-space variant, looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;int Chunk_bounds_check(Chunk *chunk, size_t start, size_t n)
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;{
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the deletion starts at the end of the preceding function and leaves a small remainder of the function being deleted? Michael's heuristic fixes this problem and results in the very readable &lt;code&gt;example_03.diff&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not the algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;example_04.diff&lt;/code&gt; was found using a different implementation of Myers'
linear-space variant. That is, both &lt;code&gt;example_03.diff&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;example_04.diff&lt;/code&gt; used the same algorithm!
The differences stem from the implementation of that algorithm and from post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A New Diffing Library for Go&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created znkr.io/diff to address these challenges in a way that works for all my use cases. Let's reiterate what I want from a diffing library:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The input can be text and arbitrary slices&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The output should be possible in unified format and as a structured result&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The API should be simple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The diffs should be minimal or near-minimal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The runtime and memory performance should be excellent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot more than what any of the existing libraries provide. When I copied and modified my old diffing library, I could adapt it to the use cases at hand. But a general-purpose diffing library needs to be general enough to cover the vast majority of use cases. At the same time, it needs to be extensible to make sure new features can be implemented without cluttering the API over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, excellent performance and minimal results are somewhat in opposition to one another and I ended up providing three different modes of operation: Default (balanced between performance and minimality), Fast (sacrifice minimal results for faster speed), Optimal (minimal result whatever the cost).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Input&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Output&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;API&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Performance2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Diff&lt;p&gt;Readability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Diff&lt;p&gt;Minimality2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Default&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="7"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fast&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Optimal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;😁&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;➕➕&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text Only&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This table only applies to text (same as the table above), non-text inputs can have a different performance (if they are not &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; or readability).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To design this API, I started with the data structures that I wanted to use as a user of the API and worked backwards from there. At a very high level, there are two structured representations of a diff that have been useful to me: a flat sequence of all deletions, insertions, and matching elements (called edits) and a nested sequence of consecutive changes (called hunks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edits are what I use to represent edits in this article; they contain the full content of both inputs and how one is transformed into the other.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hunks are a great representation for unit tests, because they are empty if both inputs are identical and they make it possible to visualize just the changes even if the inputs are large.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Arbitrary Slices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with the design for the most general case, arbitrary slices. The Go representation for diffing slices I liked the most is this one (see also znkr.io/diff):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Op describes an edit operation.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;type Op int
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;const (
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Match  Op = iota // Two slice elements match
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Delete           // A deletion from an element on the left slice
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Insert           // An insertion of an element from the right side
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Edit describes a single edit of a diff.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// - For Match, both X and Y contain the matching element.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// - For Delete, X contains the deleted element and Y is unset (zero value).
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// - For Insert, Y contains the inserted element and X is unset (zero value).
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;type Edit[T any] struct {
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Op   Op
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;20&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	X, Y T
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;21&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;22&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;23&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Hunk describes a sequence of consecutive edits.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;24&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;type Hunk[T any] struct {
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;25&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	PosX, EndX int       // Start and end position in x.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;26&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	PosY, EndY int       // Start and end position in y.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;27&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Edits      []Edit[T] // Edits to transform x[PosX:EndX] to y[PosY:EndY]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;28&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternatives I have seen are variations and combinations of two themes. Either using slices to represent edit operations in &lt;code&gt;Hunk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Hunk[T any] struct {
	Delete []T
	Insert []T
	Match  []T
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or using indices instead of elements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Edit struct {
	Op         Op
	PosX, PosY []int
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these representations work, but I found that the representations above served my use cases best. One little quirk is that &lt;code&gt;Edit&lt;/code&gt; always contains both elements. This is often unnecessary, but
there are use cases where this is very important because the elements themselves might not be equal
(e.g., if they are pointers that are compared with a custom function).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the data structures were established, it was quite obvious that the simplest way to fill them with diff data was to write two functions &lt;code&gt;diff.Edits&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;diff.Hunks&lt;/code&gt; to return the diffs. I made them extensible by
using functional options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;30&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Edits compares the contents of x and y and returns the changes necessary to convert from one to
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;31&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// the other.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;//
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;33&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Edits returns one edit for every element in the input slices. If x and y are identical, the
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;34&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// output will consist of a match edit for every input element.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;35&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func Edits[T comparable](x, y []T, opts ...Option) []Edit[T]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;36&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;37&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Hunks compares the contents of x and y and returns the changes necessary to convert from one to
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;38&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// the other.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;39&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;//
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;40&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// The output is a sequence of hunks. A hunk represents a contiguous block of changes (insertions
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;41&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// and deletions) along with some surrounding context.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;42&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func Hunks[T comparable](x, y []T, opts ...Option) []Hunk[T]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The options allow for future extensibility and allow changing the behavior of these functions. For example, the option &lt;code&gt;diff.Context(5)&lt;/code&gt; configures &lt;code&gt;Hunks&lt;/code&gt;
to provide 5 elements of surrounding context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the current API still doesn't allow arbitrary slices; it only allows slices of &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types. To fix this, I needed two other functions that provide a function to compare
two elements. The Go standard library uses the &lt;code&gt;Func&lt;/code&gt; suffix for functions like this, so I followed
the lead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;44&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// EditsFunc compares the contents of x and y using the provided equality comparison and returns the
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;45&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// changes necessary to convert from one to the other.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;46&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func EditsFunc[T any](x, y []T, eq func(a, b T) bool, opts ...Option) []Edit[T]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;47&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;48&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// HunksFunc compares the contents of x and y using the provided equality comparison and returns the
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;49&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// changes necessary to convert from one to the other.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;50&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func HunksFunc[T any](x, y []T, eq func(a, b T) bool, opts ...Option) []Hunk[T]
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Text&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this API works well to produce a structured result for arbitrary slices, it doesn't provide output in unified format for text inputs. My first approach was to provide a helper function that returns a diff in unified format: &lt;code&gt;diff.ToUnified(hunks []Hunk[string]) string&lt;/code&gt;. However, this would
make getting a unified diff more complicated. Besides requiring two function calls, it would be
necessary to split the input into lines. This, in turn, can be done in different ways, e.g., by
stripping or keeping the line breaks, which opens the door to mistakes. It's much better to provide
a simple function for the entire use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Unified compares the lines in x and y and returns the changes necessary to convert from one to
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// the other in unified format.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;func Unified[T string | []byte](x, y T, opts ...diff.Option) T
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also moved this function to the &lt;code&gt;textdiff&lt;/code&gt; package to
highlight the difference in expected input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I also happen to have use cases where I need structured results for text diffs. It would be very annoying if I had to split those into lines manually. Besides, I can make a few more assumptions about text that allow for a slight simplification of the data structures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Edit describes a single edit of a line-by-line diff.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;type Edit[T string | []byte] struct {
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Op   diff.Op // Edit operation
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;	Line T       // Line, including newline character (if any)
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;// Hunk describes a sequence of consecutive edits.
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the full API and examples for how to use it, please see the package documentation for znkr.io/diff and znkr.io/diff/textdiff. I am certain that there are use cases not covered by this API, but I feel confident that it can evolve to cover these use cases in the future. For now, all my needs are fulfilled, but if you run into a situation that can't be solved by this API or requires some contortions, please tell me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To implement this API, we need to implement a diff algorithm. There are a couple of standard diff algorithms that we can choose from. The choice of the algorithm as well as how it's implemented matters for the readability of the result as well as the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good starting point for this project was Myers' algorithm, simply because it's the fastest algorithm that can cover the whole API. In particular, the &lt;code&gt;...Func&lt;/code&gt; variants for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types
instead of &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; can't make use of a hash map. Patience and Histogram require the use of a
hash map for an efficient implementation, so Myers' really is the only choice. Another advantage of
Myers' compared to Patience and Histogram is that it will return optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the flip side, in the comparison above, it came out as relatively slow compared to the patience diff algorithm and didn't produce the most readable results. It turns out, however, that this can be mitigated and almost completely overcome for &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types using
a combination of preprocessing, heuristics, and post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not going to cover the diff algorithm in detail here. There are a number of excellent articles on the web that describe it12, but I recommend reading the paper13: All articles I have seen try to keep a distance from the theory that makes this algorithm work, but that's not really helpful if you want to understand how and why this algorithm works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Preprocessing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most impactful way to improve the performance of Myers' algorithm is to reduce the problem size. The simplest thing to do is to strip any common prefix and suffix. This is always possible and helps a little. However, it can also reduce diff readability, because it will consume matching elements eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, let's say we have this change:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;package array
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;var m = []struct{
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    name  string
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    year  int
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}{
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    {
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    {
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;17&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;        year: 1967,
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    },
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we eagerly consume the common prefix first and then the common suffix, the first 11 lines are all identical and the so are the last 4. This in turn would result in a different diff:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;18&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;    },
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;19&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, this is easy to fix in post processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much more impactful, but only efficiently possible for &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types, is to remove all elements
that are unique to either the left side or the right side, as those must always be deletions or
insertions. Non-&lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types can't be keys in a hash map in Go, which is necessary for
checking uniqueness. This preprocessing step reduced the runtime by up to
99% for a few
real-world worst-case diffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the suffix and prefix removal, stripping unique elements doesn't have any readability impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Heuristics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another very impactful way to improve the performance is Anchoring. It is based on patience diff. The word patience is a bit misleading, because it's too easily associated with having to wait and it doesn't describe the heuristic very well either. It works by finding elements that are occur exactly once on both the left and the right side. When we matching up these unique pairs we create a segmentation of the input into smaller parts that can be analyzed individually. Even better, we're very likely to find matching lines atop and below such a pair of unique elements. This allows us to shrink the segments by stripping common prefixes and suffixes. This heuristic reduced the runtime by up to 95%. Unfortunately, finding unique elements and matching them up requires a hash map again which means that it can only be used for &lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two more heuristics that are I implemented. They help for non-&lt;code&gt;comparable&lt;/code&gt; types and as a
backstop when the other heuristics don't work. Their main purpose is to avoid runaway quadratic
growth. The Good Diagonal heuristic stops searching for a better solution if we found a solution
that's good enough and the Too Expensive heuristic shortcuts the search if it becomes too
expensive which reduces the worst-case complexity from 

 to


.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, heuristics like this trade diff minimality for performance, this is not always desirable. Sometimes, a minimal diff is exactly what's required. &lt;code&gt;diff.Optimal&lt;/code&gt; disables these heuristics to always find a
minimal diff irrespective of the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Post-processing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We established before that a diff algorithm finds one of many possible solutions. Given such a solution we can discover more solutions by it locally and then selecting the best solution according to some metric. This is exactly how Michael Haggerty's indentation heuristic works for text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For any given diff, we can often slide the edits up or down in a way that doesn't change the meaning of a diff. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i.upcase
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;has the same meaning as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;+&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell/&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;["foo", "bar", "baz"].map do |i|
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;  i.upcase
&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We call edits that can be slid up or down sliders. The question is, how do we select the best slide? Michael collected human ratings for different sliders of the same diff and used them to develop a heuristic to match these ratings: diff-slider-tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this heuristic only works for text and is tuned towards code instead of prose. I decided to make it optional. It can be enabled with the &lt;code&gt;textdiff.IndentHeuristic&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Diff Representation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The representation used during the execution of the diff algorithm has a surprising impact on the algorithm performance and result readability. This is not at all obvious, and so it took me a while to figure out that the best approach is akin to a side-by-side view of a diff: You use two &lt;code&gt;[]bool&lt;/code&gt;
slices to represent the left side and the right side respectively: &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in the left side slice
represents a deletion and on the right side an insertion. &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; is a matching element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This representation has four big advantages: It can be preallocated, the order in which edits are discovered doesn't matter, it's easy to mutate during post-processing, and it's easy to generate other representations from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What exactly is the reason that two different algorithms produce different results? - I looked into this question a little, but I haven't found a conclusive answer yet.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diff algorithms are relatively complicated by themselves, but they pale in comparison to what's necessary to provide a high-quality diff library. This article tries to explain what went into my new diff library, but there's still more that I haven't implemented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here is one real-world example of why worst-case scenarios are important: Imagine you're breaking an existing feature in a way that triggers a worst-case scenario in a test. If the test is running for a very long time or runs out of memory, you're going to have to debug two problems instead of one. ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;See benchmark_comparison.txt for the source of these ratings. ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The diffmatchpatch API is very hard to use ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No support for structured results ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quadratic memory use; for my test cases, this resulted in &amp;gt;30 GB of memory used. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The mb0 API is from before generics and is a bit cumbersome to use ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;udiff has a very low threshold for when it starts to stop searching for an optimal solution. This improves the speed, but it also results in relatively large diffs. ↩︎ ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There's no single patience diff heuristic, instead there are different implementations with different performance characteristics. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Atuin Desktop: Runbooks that Run — Now Open Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atuin Desktop looks like a doc, but runs like your terminal. Script blocks, embedded terminals, database clients and prometheus charts - all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most infrastructure is held together by five commands someone remembers when shit breaks. Docs are out of date, if they exist. The real answers? Buried in Slack threads, rotting in Notion, or trapped in someone's shell history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atuin CLI fixed part of this, with synced, searchable shell history. But history isn’t enough. Teams need workflows they can repeat, share, and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why we built Atuin Desktop. Runbooks that actually run. Now open beta, and fully open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Atuin Desktop?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atuin Desktop looks like a doc, but runs like your terminal. Built to make local developer workflows repeatable, shareable, and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Runbooks should run. Workflows shouldn't live in someone's head. Docs shouldn't rot the moment you write them. Scripts, database queries, HTTP requests and Prometheus charts - all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kill context switching: Chain shell scripts, database queries, and HTTP requests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Docs that don't rot: execute directly + stay relevant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reusable automation: dynamic runbooks with Jinja-style templating&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local knowledge: Build runbooks from your real shell history&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collaborative: Sync and share via Git, or in real-time via our Hub&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in April we launched the closed beta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of you signed up, used it at your day jobs, and told us exactly what broke. We’ve listened, rebuilt, and now it’s ready for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s new since April?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our early users gave us a lot of feedback, which we've used to build something much better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Offline, file based, Git/VCS-compatible workspaces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team accounts with shared, realtime workspaces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kubernetes integration for live state and monitoring&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MySQL query blocks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dropdown and more contextual blocks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A huge number of bug fixes, performance improvements, and UI upgrades&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it’s being used&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atuin Desktop is already being used across engineering teams for serious, day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automation and debugging: linking commands, monitoring systems, and tracking results&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Database operations: managing migrations, access control, and production queries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Onboarding: getting started workflows new engineers can actually run&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deploying and managing clusters: repeatable, documented automation for real environments&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incident response: runbooks that execute instead of rotting in some internal wiki&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s become a shared system of record for the commands and processes that keep production alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re just getting started! We've got a lot in the pipeline, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block dependencies and advanced execution flow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run runbooks remotely and on CI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit logs and enhanced permissions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Comments and deeper collaboration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More block types&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Specify local networks, containers, and more&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tighter integration with authentication and cloud providers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More polish, more speed, fewer bugs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop copy-pasting from outdated wiki pages, and get started with Atuin Desktop&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting involved&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atuin Desktop is now in open beta and open source under the Apache 2.0 license. Star it, fork it, break it: github.com/atuinsh/desktop&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure deserves better than rotting docs and tribal knowledge. Atuin Desktop is our attempt to fix that for everyone who’s ever said “I swear I’ve done this before.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mind the encryptionroot: How to save your data when ZFS loses its mind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While ZFS has a well-earned reputation for data integrity and reliability, OpenZFS native encryption has some incredibly sharp edges that will cut you if you don't know where to be careful. Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way, standing in a pool of my own blood and tears after thoroughly lacerating myself. I very nearly permanently lost 8.5 TiB of data after performing what should've been a series of simple, routine ZFS operations but resulted in an undecryptable dataset. Time has healed the wound enough that I am no longer filled with anguish just thinking about it, so I will now share my experience in the hope that you may learn from my mistakes. Together, we'll go over the unfortunate series of events that led to this happening and how it could've been avoided, learn how ZFS actually works under the hood, use our newfound knowledge to debug and reproduce the issue at hand, and finally compile a modified version of ZFS to repair the corrupted state and rescue our precious data. This is the postmortem of that terrible, horrible, no good, very bad weekâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The issue covered in this postmortem only applies to OpenZFS native encryption. Oracle ZFS has its own encryption scheme which is different and, as far as I can tell, should not be vulnerable to this particular failure mode, though I have not personally tested it. Thank you to u/HobartTasmania for pointing this out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: An unfortunate series of events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The status quo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In the beginning, there were two ZFS pools: &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; (names changed for clarity). Each pool was hosted on an instance of TrueNAS CORE 13.0-U5.1 located at two different sites about an hour's drive apart with poor Internet connectivity between them. For this reason, a third pool &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; was periodically moved between the two sites and used to exchange snapshots of &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; datasets for backup purposes. ZFS dataset snapshots would be indirectly relayed from &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; (and vice versa) using &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; as an intermediate ZFS send/recv source/destination (e.g. &lt;code&gt;old/foo@2023-06-01&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old/foo@2023-06-01&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;new/old/foo@2023-06-01&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; pool was natively encrypted from the very beginning. When ZFS snapshots were sent from &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/new&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;old/new&lt;/code&gt;, they were sent raw, meaning that blocks were copied unmodified in their encrypted form. To decrypt and mount them on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt;, you would need to first load &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;'s hex encryption key, which is stored in TrueNAS's SQLite database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; pool, on the other hand, was created before the advent of native encryption and was unencrypted for the first part of its life. Because it's desirable to encrypt data at rest, an encrypted dataset &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; was created for &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; using a passphrase encryption key when &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; was set up. Unencrypted snapshots were sent non-raw from &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, where they were encrypted, and then sent raw from &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;new/old&lt;/code&gt;. To decrypt and mount them on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, you would need to first load &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;'s passphrase encryption key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was all tested thoroughly and snapshots were proven to be readable at each point on every pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Encrypting the old pool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Now that we had encrypted snapshots of &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, we wanted to encrypt &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; itself. To do this, I simply took &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; offline during a maintenance window to prevent new writes, took snapshots of all datasets, sent them to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, and then sent the raw encrypted snapshots from &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; back to &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt;. Once I verified each dataset had been encrypted successfully, I destroyed the unencrypted dataset, updated the mount point of the encrypted dataset to that of the late unencrypted dataset, and then moved on to the next dataset. After all datasets were migrated, I used &lt;code&gt;zfs change-key -i&lt;/code&gt; to make all child datasets inherit from the new &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; encryption root, and then changed the key of the encryption root from a passphrase to a hex key, since TrueNAS only supported automatically unlocking datasets with hex encryption keys. Finally, I issued a &lt;code&gt;zpool initialize&lt;/code&gt; to overwrite all the unencrypted blocks which were now in unallocated space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Spoiler Alert: It may not be immediately obvious why, but changing the encryption key on &lt;code&gt;old/encryption&lt;/code&gt; silently broke backups of &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; datasets. Snapshots would still send and recv successfully, but were no longer decryptable or mountable. Since the encryption key is not normally loaded, and we only load it when periodically testing the backups, we would not realize until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson: Test backups continuously so you get immediate feedback when they break.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Decommissioning the old pool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Later, the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; pool was moved to the same site as the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; pool, so we wanted to fully decommission &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; and migrate all its datasets to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;. I began going about this in a similar way. I took &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; offline to prevent new writes, sent snapshots to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, and then to &lt;code&gt;new/old&lt;/code&gt;. It was at this point that I made a very unfortunate mistake: I accidentally destroyed one dataset &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted/foo&lt;/code&gt; before verifying the files were readable on &lt;code&gt;new/old/foo&lt;/code&gt;, and I would soon realize that they were not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson: Wait to make all destructive changes together at the very end instead of interspersed where they could accidentally be performed in the wrong order.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What do you mean, permission denied? I am root!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Crap, I already destroyed &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted/foo&lt;/code&gt;. This is not good, but I can still restore it from the remaining copy on &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old/foo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[sam@newnas ~]$ sudo zfs load-key sneakernet/old
Enter passphrase for 'sneakernet/old':
[sam@newnas ~]$ sudo zfs mount sneakernet/old/foo
cannot mount 'sneakernet/old/foo': Permission denied&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Oh no, &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; is broken too. This is very not good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an act of desperation, I tried rebooting the machine, but it didn't change a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is at this point that I realized:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Something has gone terribly wrong to prevent datasets on both &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;new/old&lt;/code&gt;from mounting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whatever it is, it's not likely going to be easy to diagnose or fix.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There's a very real possibility the data might be gone forever.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found myself in a hole and I wanted to stop digging. Fortunately, uptime was no longer critical for the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; datasets after the relocation, so I could afford to step away from the keyboard, collect my thoughts, and avoid making the situation any worse that it already was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2: Debugging the issue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the worst of the overwhelming, visceral feelings that come with the realization that you may have just caused permanent data loss had subsided, I started to work the incident and try to figure out why the backups aren't mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As a precaution, I first exported the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; pool and took a forensic image of every disk in the pool. ZFS is a copy-on-write filesystem, so even though the dataset had been destroyed, most of the data was probably still on disk, just completely inaccessible with the normal ZFS tooling. In the worst case scenario, I may have had to try to forensically reconstruct the dataset from what was left on disk, and I didn't want to risk causing any more damage than I already had. Fortunately, I never had to use the disk images, but they still served as a valuable safety net while debugging and repairing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I realized that if we are to have any chance of debugging and fixing this issue, I need to learn how ZFS actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Learning how ZFS actually works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I unfortunately did not keep track of every resource I consumed, but in addition to reading the source and docs, I found these talks by Jeff Bonwick, Bill Moore, and Matt Ahrens (the original creators of ZFS) to be particularly helpful in understanding the design and implementation of ZFS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems Part 1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems Part 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ZFS: The Last Word in File Systems Part 3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How ZFS Snapshots Really Work&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend watching them all despite their age and somewhat poor recording quality, but will summarize the relevant information for those who don't have 3 hours to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZFS is a copy-on-write filesystem, which means that it does not overwrite blocks in place when a write is requested. Instead, the updated contents are written to a newly allocated block, and the old block is freed, which keeps the filesystem consistent if a write is interrupted. All blocks of both data and metadata are arranged in a Merkle tree structure where each block pointer contains a checksum of the child block, which allows ZFS to detect both block corruption and misdirected/phantom reads/writes. This means that any write will cause the block's checksum to change, which will then cause the parent block's checksum to change (since the parent block includes the block pointer which includes checksum of the child block that changed), and so on, all the way up to the root of the tree which ZFS calls an uberblock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uberblocks are written atomically, and because of the Merkle tree structure, they always represent a consistent snapshot of the entire filesystem at a point in time. Writes are batched together into transaction groups identified by a monotonically increasing counter, and each transaction group when synced to disk produces a new uberblock and associated filesystem tree. Taking a snapshot is then as simple as saving an uberblock and not freeing any of the blocks it points to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the checksum, each block pointer also contains the transaction group id in which the child block was written, which is called the block's birth time or creation time. ZFS uses birth times to determine which blocks have been written before or after a snapshot. Any blocks with a birth time less than or equal to the snapshot's birth time, must have been written before the snapshot was taken, and conversely, any blocks with a birth time greater than the snapshot's birth time must have been written after the snapshot was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One application of birth times is to generate incremental send streams between two snapshots. ZFS walks the tree but only needs to include blocks where the birth time is both greater than the first snapshot and less than or equal to the second snapshot. In fact, you don't even need to keep the data of the first snapshot aroundâyou can create a bookmark which saves the snapshot's transaction id (but none of the data blocks), delete the snapshot to free its data, and then use the bookmark as the source to generate the same incremental send stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler Alert: Chekhov's bookmark will become relevant later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Learning how ZFS native encryption actually works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZFS native encryption is a relatively new feature, which was first released in OpenZFS 0.8.0 (2019) and subsequently made it into FreeBSD 13.0 (2021) when OpenZFS was adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the docs, I found this 2016 talk on ZFS Native Encryption by Tom Caputi (the original author of native encryption) to be helpful in understanding its design and implementation. Again, I will summarize the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; ZFS native encryption works by encrypting dataset blocks with an symmetric authenticated encryption cipher suite (AES-256-GCM by default). To use native encryption, you must create a new dataset with &lt;code&gt;-o encryption=on&lt;/code&gt; which generates a unique master key for the dataset. The dataset's master key is then used to derive block data encryption keys with a salted HKDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The master key can't be changed, so it is encrypted with a wrapping key which can be changed. The wrapping key is provided by the user with &lt;code&gt;zfs load-key&lt;/code&gt; and can be changed with &lt;code&gt;zfs change-key&lt;/code&gt; which re-encrypts the same master key with a new wrapping key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The encrypted master keys are stored in each dataset since each dataset has its own master key, but the wrapping key parameters are stored on what is called the encryption root dataset. The encryption root may be the same encrypted dataset, or it may be a parent of the encrypted dataset. When a child encrypted dataset inherits from a parent encryption root, the encryption root's wrapping key is used to decrypt the child dataset's master key. This is how one key can be used to unlock a parent encryption root dataset and all child encrypted datasets that inherit from it at the same time instead of having to load a key for every single encrypted dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In our case, &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/new&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; are the encryption roots, and all child encrypted datasets inherit from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forming a hypothesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, we now know enough to form a hypothesis as to what may have happened. Feel free to pause here and try to figure it out on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Recall that &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; was created using a passphrase encryption key, and &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; was created by raw sending &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, so it initially used the same passphrase derived wrapping encryption key. When the &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; encryption key was changed from a passphrase to a hex key, ZFS must have changed the wrapping key parameters on the &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; encryption root and re-encrypted all child encrypted dataset master keys with the new hex wrapping key. Crucially, a new snapshot of &lt;code&gt;old/encrypted&lt;/code&gt; was never taken and sent to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; because it ostensibly didn't contain any data and was just a container for the child datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Hypothesis: When subsequent snapshots were sent from &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;, the master keys of the child encrypted datasets were updated to be encrypted with the new hex wrapping key, but the &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt; encryption root was never updated with the new hex wrapping key parameters because a new snapshot was never sent. Therefore, when we load the key for &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old&lt;/code&gt;, ZFS asks for the old passphrase, not a hex key, and when we try to mount &lt;code&gt;sneakernet/old/foo&lt;/code&gt;, it tries and fails to decrypt its master key with the old passphrase wrapping key instead of the new hex wrapping key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If correct, this would explain the behavior we're seeing. To test this hypothesis, let's try to reproduce the issue in a test environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Creating a test environment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TrueNAS CORE 13.0-U5.1 is based on FreeBSD 13.1, despite the different minor version numbers, so we'll create a FreeBSD 13.1 VM to test in. Make sure to include the system source tree and install on UFS so that we can build OpenZFS and reload the ZFS kernel module without rebooting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TrueNAS CORE 13.0-U5.1 uses ZFS 2.1.11, so we'll want to build the same version from source for consistency. I started by reading the Building ZFS guide and following the steps documented there with some small modifications for FreeBSD since the page was clearly written with Linux in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, install the dependencies we'll need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo pkg install autoconf automake autotools git gmake python devel/py-sysctl sudo&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, clone ZFS and check out tag zfs-2.1.11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ git clone https://github.com/openzfs/zfs

    Signed-off-by: Tony Hutter &amp;lt;hutter2@llnl.gov&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, configure, build, and install ZFS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sh autogen.sh
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ ./configure
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ gmake -s -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)    # &amp;lt;-- modified for FreeBSD
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo gmake install; sudo ldconfig  # &amp;lt;-- modified for FreeBSD&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, replace the FreeBSD's ZFS kernel module with the one we just built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo kldunload zfs.ko  # Needed because zfs.sh only unloads openzfs.ko
sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo ./scripts/zfs.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, verify we're running version 2.1.11 as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~/zfs $ sudo zfs version
zfs-2.1.11-1
zfs-kmod-2.1.11-1&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reproducing the issue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we're ready to try reproducing the issue. This took some iteration to get right, so I wrote a bash script that starts from scratch on each invocation and then runs the commands needed to reproduce the corrupt state. After quite a bit of trial and error, I eventually produced a reproducer script which does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create 2 pools: &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;using a passphrase encryption key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;which inherits&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;as its encryption root.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create files and take snapshots &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@111&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@111&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send raw snapshots &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@111&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@111&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;respectively.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Load encryption key for &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;using passphrase and mount encrypted datasets&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;. At this point,&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst&lt;/code&gt;pools are in sync.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;encryption key from passphrase to hex.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Update files and take snapshots &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@222&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@222&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send a raw incremental snapshot of &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot/child@222&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;, but do not send&lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@222&lt;/code&gt;which contains the key change!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unmount &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;and unload the cached encryption key for&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Load the encryption key for &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;using the passphrase since we didn't send the updated encryption root after changing the key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Try to remount &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we run the reproducer, the root encrypted dataset &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot&lt;/code&gt; mounts successfully and we can read the old file from the first snapshot, but the child encrypted dataset &lt;code&gt;dst/encryptionroot/child&lt;/code&gt; fails to mount with &lt;code&gt;cannot mount 'dst/encryptionroot/child: Permission denied&lt;/code&gt; just as we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo ./reproduce &amp;gt; /dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs mount dst/encryptionroot/child

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Not so easy in practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, this isn't enough to fix &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;; there are no remaining snapshots or bookmarks left on the &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; encryption root from before the key change, and we can't generate an incremental send stream without one. Mapped to our reproduced example, this means that &lt;code&gt;src/encryptionroot@111&lt;/code&gt; does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; You might think we could forcibly send the entire encryption root, but &lt;code&gt;zfs recv&lt;/code&gt; will reject it no matter what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs send --raw src/encryptionroot@222 | sudo zfs recv dst/encryptionroot
cannot receive new filesystem stream: destination 'dst/encryptionroot' exists
must specify -F to overwrite it

sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs send --raw src/encryptionroot@222 | sudo zfs recv -F dst/encryptionroot
cannot receive new filesystem stream: destination has snapshots (eg. dst/encryptionroot@111)
must destroy them to overwrite it

sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs destroy dst/encryptionroot@111
sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zfs send --raw src/encryptionroot@222 | sudo zfs recv -F dst/encryptionroot
cannot receive new filesystem stream: zfs receive -F cannot be used to destroy an encrypted filesystem or overwrite an unencrypted one with an encrypted one&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lesson: Create bookmarks before destroying snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to find a way to create an incremental send stream that contains the key change, but how?. We could try to manually craft a send stream containing the new key, but that sounds tricky. There's got to be a better way!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Idea for a hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recall that a snapshot is not the only valid source for generating an incremental send stream. What if we had a bookmark?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; A bookmark works just as well as a snapshot for generating an incremental send stream, but we don't have a bookmark on &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt; either. How is this any better?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike a snapshot, which is effectively an entire dataset tree frozen in time (very complex), a bookmark is a very simple object on disk which consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GUID of the snapshot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The transaction group the snapshot was created in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Unix timestamp when the snapshot was created.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, this is what our bookmark looks like in &lt;code&gt;zdb&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sam@zfshax:~ $ sudo zdb src/encryptionroot#111
	#111: {guid: 44e5e7755d23c673 creation_txg: 12 creation_time: 1756699200 redaction_obj: 0}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Note that &lt;code&gt;zdb&lt;/code&gt; shows the GUID in hexadecimal versus &lt;code&gt;zfs get guid&lt;/code&gt; which shows it in decimal, consistency be damned. The &lt;code&gt;redaction_obj&lt;/code&gt; is optional and only used for redaction bookmarks, so we can ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bookmark is simple enough that we could feasibly hack ZFS into manually writing one for us, provided that we can figure out the right values to use. The GUID and Unix timestamp don't really matter for generating an incremental send stream, so we could choose them arbitrarily if we had to, but the transaction group id really matters because that is what ZFS uses to determine which blocks to include.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how can we figure out what transaction group the snapshot was created in if neither the snapshot nor a bookmark of the snapshot still exist? I initially considered walking the dataset trees on each pool, diffing them to find the newest block present on both datasets, and using its transaction group id, but I found a much easier way with one of ZFS's lesser known features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A brief detour into pool histories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know about pool histories before embarking on this unplanned journey, but they are now yet another thing I love about ZFS. Every pool allocates 0.1% of its space (128 KiB minimum, 1 GiB maximum) to a ring buffer which is used to log every command that is executed on the pool. This can be used to forensically reconstruct the state of the pool over time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; ZFS also logs many internal operations in the pool history (search for &lt;code&gt;spa_history_log&lt;/code&gt; in the source code) which can be viewed with the &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; flag. For snapshots, this includes the transaction group (txg) id when the snapshot was created, which is exactly what we're looking for!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know everything we need to create the bookmark, we just need to figure out a way to manually create a bookmark with arbitrary data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hacking ZFS to manually create a bookmark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; To understand how ZFS creates a bookmark, we can trace the code path from &lt;code&gt;zfs bookmark&lt;/code&gt; all the way down to &lt;code&gt;dsl_bookmark_add&lt;/code&gt; which actually adds the bookmark node to the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;command_table&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_do_bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lzc_bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lzc_ioctl&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_ioctl_fd&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zcmd_ioctl_compat&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_ioctl_register bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;zfs_ioc_bookmark&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_create&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_create_sync&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_create_sync_impl_book&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dsl_bookmark_node_add&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the bookmark structure physically written to disk:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;zfs/include/sys/dsl_bookmark.h&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/*

#define	BOOKMARK_PHYS_SIZE_V1	(3 * sizeof (uint64_t))
#define	BOOKMARK_PHYS_SIZE_V2	(12 * sizeof (uint64_t))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Only the first 3 fields are required for v1 bookmarks, while v2 bookmarks contain all 12 fields. &lt;code&gt;dsl_bookmark_node_add&lt;/code&gt; only writes a v2 bookmark if one of the 9 v2 fields are non-zero, so we can leave them all zero to write a v1 bookmark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After a few iterations, I had a patch which hijacks the normal &lt;code&gt;zfs bookmark pool/dataset#src pool/dataset#dst&lt;/code&gt; code path to create a bookmark with arbitrary data when the source bookmark name is &lt;code&gt;missing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

cannot receive incremental stream: IV set guid missing. See errata 4 at https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/msg/ZFS-8000-ER.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The final obstacle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; ZFS refuses the stream because it is missing a source IV set GUID (see &lt;code&gt;from_ivset_guid = 0x0&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;zstreamdump&lt;/code&gt; above). This is because we created a v1 bookmark which does not contain the IV set GUID like a v2 bookmark would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we know that the send stream is created using the right snapshots, we can temporarily disable checking IV set GUIDs to allow the snapshot to be received as described in errata 4.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; At this point, we can now reliably fix the issue in our test environment. All we need to do now is use our hacked ZFS build to create the bookmark on &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt;, send an incremental snapshot of the encryption root with the new key to &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt;, and then send that snapshot from &lt;code&gt;sneakernet&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;. I rebuilt ZFS again with the correct transaction group, GUID, and creation timestamp for &lt;code&gt;old&lt;/code&gt;, repeated the same steps with the names changed, and thanks to our thorough testing, it worked on the first try!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a week of intense research and debugging, I had rescued our data back from the brink and could again sleep soundly at night. While I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about ZFS, I can't help but think about how this entire incident could have been avoided at several key points which translate directly into lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test backups continuously so you get immediate feedback when they break.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wait to make all destructive changes together at the very end instead of interspersed where they could accidentally be performed in the wrong order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Always send a snapshot of the encryption root after changing the encryption key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create bookmarks before destroying snapshots.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope that you may learn from my mistakes and avoid a similar incident. If you do happen to find yourself in a similar predicament, I'd love to hear from you regardless of whether this postmortem was helpful or not. My contact details can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing what I now know about ZFS native encryption, I find it difficult to recommend until the sharp edges have all been filed down. In most cases, I'd prefer to encrypt the entire pool at the block device level and encrypt send streams with age. But if you really do need the flexibility offered by native encryption, always remember to mind the encryptionroot!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

An enormous body of work has accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained, teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises.&lt;lb/&gt;The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and KL-divergence.&lt;lb/&gt;The chapters on "bandits with similarity information", "bandits with knapsacks" and "bandits and agents" can also be consumed as standalone surveys on the respective topics.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Aleksandrs Slivkins [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Mon, 15 Apr 2019 18:17:01 UTC (510 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Mon, 29 Apr 2019 20:45:01 UTC (510 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:39:03 UTC (536 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v4] Sun, 15 Sep 2019 02:06:22 UTC (557 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v5] Mon, 30 Sep 2019 00:15:42 UTC (543 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v6] Sat, 26 Jun 2021 20:15:32 UTC (639 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v7] Sat, 8 Jan 2022 20:05:40 UTC (627 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v8] Wed, 3 Apr 2024 21:32:42 UTC (629 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;Born from the ashes of Stadia, this repository contains tools for syncing and streaming files from Windows to Windows or Linux. The tools are based on Content Defined Chunking (CDC), in particular FastCDC, to split up files into chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Stadia, game developers had access to Linux cloud instances to run games. Most developers wrote their games on Windows, though. Therefore, they needed a way to make them available on the remote Linux instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As developers had SSH access to those instances, they could use &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; to copy
the game content. However, this was impractical, especially with the shift to
working from home during the pandemic with sub-par internet connections. &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;
always copies full files, there is no "delta mode" to copy only the things that
changed, it is slow for many small files, and there is no fast compression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help this situation, we developed two tools, &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;,
which enable developers to quickly iterate on their games without repeatedly
incurring the cost of transmitting dozens of GBs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; is a tool to sync files from a Windows machine to a Linux device,
similar to the standard Linux rsync. It is
basically a copy tool, but optimized for the case where there is already an old
version of the files available in the target directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It quickly skips files if timestamp and file size match.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It uses fast compression for all data transfer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a file changed, it determines which parts changed and only transfers the differences.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remote diffing algorithm is based on CDC. In our tests, it is up to 30x faster than the one used in &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; (1500 MB/s vs 50 MB/s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following chart shows a comparison of &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; and Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; running
under Cygwin on Windows. The test data consists of 58 development builds
of some game provided to us for evaluation purposes. The builds are 40-45 GB
large. For this experiment, we uploaded the first build, then synced the second
build with each of the two tools and measured the time. For example, syncing
from build 1 to build 2 took 210 seconds with the Cygwin &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, but only 75
seconds with &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;. The three outliers are probably feature drops from
another development branch, where the delta was much higher. Overall,
&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; syncs files about 3 times faster than Cygwin &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also ran the experiment with the native Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, i.e syncing Linux to
Linux, to rule out issues with Cygwin. Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; performed on average 35%
worse than Cygwin &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, which can be attributed to CPU differences. We did
not include it in the figure because of this, but you can find it
here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; splits a file into fixed-size chunks of typically
several KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the file is modified in the middle, e.g. by inserting &lt;code&gt;xxxx&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;567&lt;/code&gt;,
this usually means that the modified chunks as well as
all subsequent chunks change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; algorithm hashes the chunks of the remote "old" file
and sends the hashes to the local device. The local device then figures out
which parts of the "new" file matches known chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simplification. The actual algorithm is more complicated and uses two hashes, a weak rolling hash and a strong hash, see here for a great overview. What makes &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; relatively slow is the "no match" situation where the rolling hash does
not match any remote hash, and the algorithm has to roll the hash forward and
perform a hash map lookup for each byte. &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; goes to
great lengths
optimizing lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; does not use fixed-size chunks, but instead variable-size,
content-defined chunks. That means, chunk boundaries are determined by the
local content of the file, in practice a 64 byte sliding window. For more
details, see
the FastCDC paper
or take a look at our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the file is modified in the middle, only the modified chunks, but not subsequent chunks change (unless they are less than 64 bytes away from the modifications).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computing the chunk boundaries is cheap and involves only a left-shift, a memory lookup, an &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; operation for each input byte. This is cheaper
than the hash map lookup for the standard &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this, the &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; algorithm is faster than the standard
&lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;. It is also simpler. Since chunk boundaries move along with insertions
or deletions, the task to match local and remote hashes is a trivial set
difference operation. It does not involve a per-byte hash map lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt; is a tool to stream files and directories from a Windows machine to
a Linux device. Conceptually, it is similar to
sshfs, but it is optimized for read speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It caches streamed data on the Linux device.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If a file is re-read on Linux after it changed on Windows, only the differences are streamed again. The rest is read from the cache.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stat operations are very fast since the directory metadata (filenames, permissions etc.) is provided in a streaming-friendly way.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To efficiently determine which parts of a file changed, the tool uses the same CDC-based diffing algorithm as &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;. Changes to Windows files are almost
immediately reflected on Linux, with a delay of roughly (0.5s + 0.7s x total
size of changed files in GB).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool does not support writing files back from Linux to Windows; the Linux directory is readonly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following chart compares times from starting a game to reaching the menu. In one case, the game is streamed via &lt;code&gt;sshfs&lt;/code&gt;, in the other case we use
&lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;. Overall, we see a 2x to 5x speedup.&lt;/p&gt;

remote syncs is being added, see

    &lt;p&gt;Download the precompiled binaries from the latest release to a Windows device and unzip them. The Linux binaries are automatically deployed to &lt;code&gt;~/.cache/cdc-file-transfer&lt;/code&gt; by the Windows tools. There is no need to manually
deploy them. We currently provide Linux binaries compiled on
Github's latest Ubuntu version.
If the binaries work for you, you can skip the following two sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the project can be built from source. Some binaries have to be built on Windows, some on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build the tools from source, the following steps have to be executed on both Windows and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download and install Bazel from here. See workflow logs for the currently used version.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clone the repository. &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/google/cdc-file-transfer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Initialize submodules. &lt;code&gt;cd cdc-file-transfer git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, install an SSH client on the Windows machine if not present. The file transfer tools require &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two tools CDC RSync and CDC Stream can be built and used independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Linux device, build the Linux components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config linux --compilation_mode=opt --linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all --copt=-fdata-sections --copt=-ffunction-sections --linkopt=-Wl,--gc-sections //cdc_rsync_server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Windows device, build the Windows components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config windows --compilation_mode=opt --copt=/GL //cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy the Linux build output file &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync_server&lt;/code&gt;from&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin/cdc_rsync_server&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin\cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;on the Windows machine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Linux device, build the Linux components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config linux --compilation_mode=opt --linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all --copt=-fdata-sections --copt=-ffunction-sections --linkopt=-Wl,--gc-sections //cdc_fuse_fs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On a Windows device, build the Windows components &lt;code&gt;bazel build --config windows --compilation_mode=opt --copt=/GL //cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy the Linux build output files &lt;code&gt;cdc_fuse_fs&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;libfuse.so&lt;/code&gt;from&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin/cdc_fuse_fs&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;bazel-bin\cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt;on the Windows machine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tools require a setup where you can use SSH and SFTP from the Windows machine to the Linux device without entering a password, e.g. by using key-based authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the tools search &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt; from the path environment
variable. If you can run the following commands in a Windows cmd without
entering your password, you are all set:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh user@linux.device.com
sftp user@linux.device.com
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; is the Linux user and &lt;code&gt;linux.device.com&lt;/code&gt; is the Linux host to
SSH into or copy the file to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If additional arguments are required, it is recommended to provide an SSH config file. By default, both &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt; use the file at
&lt;code&gt;%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config&lt;/code&gt; on Windows, if it exists. A possible config file
that sets a username, a port, an identity file and a known host file could look
as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Host linux_device
	HostName linux.device.com
	User user
	Port 12345
	IdentityFile C:\path\to\id_rsa
	UserKnownHostsFile C:\path\to\known_hosts
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt; cannot be found, you can specify the full paths via
the command line arguments &lt;code&gt;--ssh-command&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--sftp-command&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start&lt;/code&gt; (see below), or set the environment variables
&lt;code&gt;CDC_SSH_COMMAND&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CDC_SFTP_COMMAND&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set CDC_SSH_COMMAND="C:\path with space\to\ssh.exe"
set CDC_SFTP_COMMAND="C:\path with space\to\sftp.exe"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that you can also specify SSH configuration via the environment variables instead of using a config file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set CDC_SSH_COMMAND=C:\path\to\ssh.exe -p 12345 -i C:\path\to\id_rsa -oUserKnownHostsFile=C:\path\to\known_hosts
set CDC_SFTP_COMMAND=C:\path\to\sftp.exe -P 12345 -i C:\path\to\id_rsa -oUserKnownHostsFile=C:\path\to\known_hosts
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the small &lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ssh.exe&lt;/code&gt; and the capital &lt;code&gt;-P&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;sftp.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Google internal usage, set the following environment variables to enable SSH authentication using a Google security key:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set CDC_SSH_COMMAND=C:\gnubby\bin\ssh.exe
set CDC_SFTP_COMMAND=C:\gnubby\bin\sftp.exe
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that you will have to touch the security key multiple times during the first run. Subsequent runs only require a single touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; is used similar to &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; or the Linux &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; command. To sync a
single Windows file &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\file.txt&lt;/code&gt; to the home directory &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; on the Linux
device &lt;code&gt;linux.device.com&lt;/code&gt;, run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\file.txt user@linux.device.com:~
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; understands the usual Windows wildcards &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\*.txt user@linux.device.com:~
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sync the contents of the Windows directory &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\assets&lt;/code&gt; recursively to
&lt;code&gt;~/assets&lt;/code&gt; on the Linux device, run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\assets\* user@linux.device.com:~/assets -r
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get per file progress, add &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\assets\* user@linux.device.com:~/assets -vr
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool also supports local syncs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync C:\path\to\assets\* C:\path\to\destination -vr
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stream the Windows directory &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\assets&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;~/assets&lt;/code&gt; on the Linux
device, run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start C:\path\to\assets user@linux.device.com:~/assets
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes all files and directories in &lt;code&gt;C:\path\to\assets&lt;/code&gt; available on
&lt;code&gt;~/assets&lt;/code&gt; immediately, as if it were a local copy. However, data is streamed
from Windows to Linux as files are accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stop the streaming session, enter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream stop user@linux.device.com:~/assets
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The command also accepts wildcards. For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream stop user@*:*
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stops all existing streaming sessions for the given user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On first run, &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream&lt;/code&gt; starts a background service, which does all the work.
The &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream stop&lt;/code&gt; commands are just RPC clients that
talk to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service logs to &lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\cdc-file-transfer\logs&lt;/code&gt; by default. The logs are
useful to investigate issues with asset streaming. To pass custom arguments, or
to debug the service, create a JSON config file at
&lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\cdc-file-transfer\cdc_stream.json&lt;/code&gt; with command line flags.
For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ "verbosity":3 }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;instructs the service to log debug messages. Try &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start-service -h&lt;/code&gt;
for a list of available flags. Alternatively, run the service manually with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cdc_stream start-service
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and pass the flags as command line arguments. When you run the service manually, the flag &lt;code&gt;--log-to-stdout&lt;/code&gt; is particularly useful as it logs to the console
instead of to the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cdc_rsync&lt;/code&gt; always logs to the console. To increase log verbosity, pass &lt;code&gt;-vvv&lt;/code&gt;
for debug logs or &lt;code&gt;-vvvv&lt;/code&gt; for verbose logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For both sync and stream, the debug logs contain all SSH and SFTP commands that are attempted to run, which is very useful for troubleshooting. If a command fails unexpectedly, copy it and run it in isolation. Pass &lt;code&gt;-vv&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-vvv&lt;/code&gt; for
additional debug output.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Gaslit Asset Class&lt;/head&gt;Before I explain that much of what you have been told about cryptocurrency technology is gaslighting, I should stress that I hold no long or short positions in cryptocurrencies, their derivatives or related companies. Unlike most people discussing them, I am not "talking my book".&lt;p&gt;To fit in the allotted time, this talk focuses mainly on Bitcoin and omits many of the finer points. My text, with links to the sources and additional material in footnotes, will go up on my blog later today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Am I Here?&lt;/head&gt;I imagine few of you would understand why a retired software engineer with more than forty years in Silicon Valley was asked to address you on cryptocurrencies[1].&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;NVDA Log Plot&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my wife and I started a program at Stanford that is still running 27 years later. She was a career librarian at the Library of Congress and the Stanford Library. She was part of the team that, 30 years ago, pioneered the transition of academic publishing to the Web. She was also the person who explained citation indices to Larry and Sergey, which led to Page Rank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academic literature has archival value. Multiple libraries hold complete runs on paper of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society starting 360 years ago[2]. The interesting engineering problem we faced was how to enable libraries to deliver comparable longevity to Web-published journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Five Years Before Satoshi Nakamoto&lt;/head&gt;I worked with a group of outstanding Stanford CS Ph.D. students to design and implement a system for stewardship of Web content modeled on the paper library system. The goal was to make it extremely difficult for even a powerful adversary to delete or modify content without detection. It is called LOCKSS, for Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe; a decentralized peer-to-peer system secured by Proof-of-Work. We won a "Best Paper" award for it five years before Satoshi Nakamoto published his decentralized peer-to-peer system secured by Proof-of-Work. When he did, LOCKSS had been in production for a few years and we had learnt a lot about how difficult decentralization is in the online world.&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin built on more than two decades of research. Neither we nor Nakamoto invented Proof-of-Work, Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor published it in 1992. Nakamoto didn't invent blockchains, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta patented them in 1991. He was extremely clever in assembling well-known techniques into a cryptocurrency, but his only major innovation was the Longest Chain Rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Digital cash&lt;/head&gt;The fundamental problem of representing cash in digital form is that a digital coin can be endlessly copied, thus you need some means to prevent each of the copies being spent. When you withdraw cash from an ATM, turning digital cash in your account into physical cash in your hand, the bank performs an atomic transaction against the database mapping account numbers to balances. The bank is trusted to prevent multiple spending.&lt;p&gt;There had been several attempts at a cryptocurrency before Bitcoin. The primary goals of the libertarians and cypherpunks were that a cryptocurrency be as anonymous as physical cash, and that it not have a central point of failure that had to be trusted. The only one to get any traction was David Chaum's DigiCash; it was anonymous but it was centralized to prevent multiple spending and it involved banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nakamoto's magnum opus&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bitcoin claims: &lt;/p&gt; When in November 2008 Nakamoto published Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System it was the peak of the Global Financial Crisis and people were very aware that the financial system was broken (and it still is). Because it solved many of the problems that had dogged earlier attempts at electronic cash, it rapidly attracted a clique of enthusiasts. When Nakamoto went silent in 2010 they took over proseltyzing the system. The main claims they made were:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The system was trustless because it was decentralized.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It was a medium of exchange for buying and selling in the real world.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Transactions were faster and cheaper than in the existing financial system.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It was secured by Proof-of-Work and cryptography.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It was privacy-preserving.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The system was trustless because it was decentralized.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It was a medium of exchange for buying and selling in the real world.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Transactions were faster and cheaper than in the existing financial system.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It was secured by Proof-of-Work and cryptography.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It was privacy-preserving.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Trustless because decentralized (1)&lt;/head&gt;Assuming that the Bitcoin network consists of a large number of roughly equal nodes, it randomly selects a node to determine the transactions that will form the next block. There is no need to trust any particular node because the chance that they will be selected is small.[3]&lt;p&gt; At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node. &lt;/p&gt; But only three days after publishing his white paper, Nakamoto understood that this assumption would become false:&lt;quote&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto 2nd November 2008The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. ... The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto: 29th July 2010&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.He didn't change his mind. On 29th July 2010, less than five months before he went silent, he made the same point:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. ... The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms."Letting users be users" necessarily means that the "users" have to trust the "few nodes" to include their transactions in blocks. The very strong economies of scale of technology in general and "big server farms" in particular meant that the centralizing force described in W. Brian Arthur's 1994 book Increasing Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy resulted in there being "fewer nodes". Indeed, on 13th June 2014 a single node controlled 51% of Bitcoin's mining, the GHash pool.[4]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Trustless because decentralized (2)&lt;/head&gt;In June 2022 Cooperation among an anonymous group protected Bitcoin during failures of decentralization by Alyssa Blackburn et al showed that it had not been decentralized from the very start. The same month a DARPA-sponsored report entitled Are Blockchains Decentralized? by a large team from the Trail of Bits security company examined the economic and many other centralizing forces affecting a wide range of blockchain implementations and concluded that the answer to their question is "No".[5]&lt;p&gt;The same centralizing economic forces apply to Proof-of-Stake blockchains such as Ethereum. Grant's Memo to the bitcoiners explained the process last February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Trustless because decentralized (3)&lt;/head&gt;Another centralizing force drives pools like GHash. The network creates a new block and rewards the selected node about every ten minutes. Assuming they're all state-of-the-art, there are currently about 15M rigs mining Bitcoin[6]. Their economic life is around 18 months, so only 0.5%% of them will ever earn a reward. The owners of mining rigs pool their efforts, converting a small chance of a huge reward into a steady flow of smaller rewards. On average GHash was getting three rewards an hour.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A medium of exchange (1)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quote from: Insti, July 17, 2010, 02:33:41 AM&lt;/p&gt; Bitcoin's ten-minute block time is a problem for real-world buying and selling[7], but the problem is even worse. Network delays mean a transaction isn't final when you see it in a block. Assuming no-one controlled more than 10% of the hashing power, Nakamoto required another 5 blocks to have been added to the chain, so 99.9% finality would take an hour. With a more realistic 30%, the rule should have been 23 blocks, with finality taking 4 hours[8].&lt;quote&gt;How would a Bitcoin snack machine work?I believe it’ll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.&lt;list&gt;You don’t want to have to wait an hour for you transaction to be confirmed.&lt;/list&gt;&lt;item&gt;You want to walk up to the machine. Send it a bitcoin.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Walk away eating your nice sugary snack. (Profit!)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The vending machine company doesn’t want to give away lots of free candy.&lt;lb/&gt;How does step 2 work?&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto: 17th July 2010&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nakamoto's 17th July 2010 exchange with Insti shows he understood that the Bitcoin network couldn't be used for ATMs, vending machines, buying drugs or other face-to-face transactions because he went on to describe how a payment processing service layered on top of it would work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A medium of exchange (2)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; assuming that the two sides are rational actors and the smart contract language is Turing-complete, there is no escrow smart contract that can facilitate this exchange without either relying on third parties or enabling at least one side to extort the other.&lt;lb/&gt;two-party escrow smart contracts are ... simply a game of who gets to declare their choice ﬁrst and commit it on the blockchain sooner, hence forcing the other party to concur with their choice. The order of transactions on a blockchain is essentially decided by the miners. Thus, the party with better connectivity to the miners or who is willing to pay higher transaction fees, would be able to declare their choice to the smart contract ﬁrst and extort the other party.&lt;/p&gt; The situation is even worse when it comes to buying and selling real-world objects via programmable blockchains such as Ethereum[9]. In 2021 Amir Kafshdar Goharshady showed that[10]:&lt;p&gt;two-party escrow smart contracts are ... simply a game of who gets to declare their choice ﬁrst and commit it on the blockchain sooner, hence forcing the other party to concur with their choice. The order of transactions on a blockchain is essentially decided by the miners. Thus, the party with better connectivity to the miners or who is willing to pay higher transaction fees, would be able to declare their choice to the smart contract ﬁrst and extort the other party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Amir Kafshdar Goharshady, Irrationality, Extortion, or Trusted Third-parties: Why it is Impossible to Buy and Sell Physical Goods Securely on the Blockchain&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;assuming that the two sides are rational actors and the smart contract language is Turing-complete, there is no escrow smart contract that can facilitate this exchange without either relying on third parties or enabling at least one side to extort the other.Goharshady noted that:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;on the Ethereum blockchain escrows with trusted third-parties are used more often than two-party escrows, presumably because they allow dispute resolution by a human.And goes on to show that in practice trusted third-party escrow services are essential because two-party escrow smart contracts are:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;simply a game of who gets to declare their choice ﬁrst and commit it on the blockchain sooner, hence forcing the other party to concur with their choice. The order of transactions on a blockchain is essentially decided by the miners. Thus, the party with better connectivity to the miners or who is willing to pay higher transaction fees, would be able to declare their choice to the smart contract ﬁrst and extort the other party.The choice being whether or not the good had been delivered. Given the current enthusiasm for tokenization of physical goods the market for trusted escrow services looks bright.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fast transactions&lt;/head&gt;Actually the delay between submitting a transaction and finality is unpredictable and can be much longer than an hour. Transactions are validated by miners then added to the mempool of pending transactions where they wait until either:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The selected network node chooses it as one of the most profitable to include in its block.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It reaches either its specified timeout or the default of 2 weeks.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Mempool count&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distribution of transaction wait times is highly skewed. The median wait is typically around a block time. The proportion of low-fee transactions means the average wait is normally around 10 times that. But when everyone wants to transact the ratio spikes to over 40 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cheap transactions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Average fee/transaction&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The fee to be paid to the miner which the user chose to include in the transaction. In effect, transaction slots are auctioned off.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The transactions the miner included in the block to front- and back-run the user's transaction, called Maximal Extractable Value[11]:&lt;quote&gt;Maximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secured by Proof-of-Work (1)&lt;/head&gt;In cryptocurrencies "secured" means that the cost of an attack exceeds the potential loot. The security provided by Proof-of-Work is linear in its cost, unlike techniques such as encryption, whose security is exponential in cost. It is generally believed that it is impractical to reverse a Bitcoin transaction after about an hour because the miners are wasting such immense sums on Proof-of-Work. Bitcoin pays these immense sums, but it doesn't get the decentralization they ostensibly pay for.&lt;p&gt; Monero, a privacy-focused blockchain network, has been undergoing an attempted 51% attack — an existential threat to any blockchain. In the case of a successful 51% attack, where a single entity becomes responsible for 51% or more of a blockchain's mining power, the controlling entity could reorganize blocks, attempt to double-spend, or censor transactions.&lt;lb/&gt;A company called Qubic has been waging the 51% attack by offering economic rewards for miners who join the Qubic mining pool. They claim to be "stress testing" Monero, though many in the Monero community have condemned Qubic for what they see as a malicious attack on the network or a marketing stunt.&lt;/p&gt; The advent of "mining as a service" about 7 years ago made 51% attacks against smaller Proof-of-Work alt-coin such as Bitcoin Gold endemic. In August Molly White reported that Monero faces 51% attack:&lt;p&gt;A company called Qubic has been waging the 51% attack by offering economic rewards for miners who join the Qubic mining pool. They claim to be "stress testing" Monero, though many in the Monero community have condemned Qubic for what they see as a malicious attack on the network or a marketing stunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Molly White: Monero faces 51% attack&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018's The Economic Limits Of Bitcoin And The Blockchain Eric Budish of the Booth School analyzed two versions of the 51% attack. I summarized his analysis of the classic multiple spend attack thus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Note that only Bitcoin and Ethereum among cryptocurrencies with "market cap" over $100M would cost more than $100K to attack. The total "market cap" of these 8 currencies is $271.71B and the total cost to 51% attack them is $1.277M or 4.7E-6 of their market cap.His key insight was that to ensure that 51% attacks were uneconomic, the reward for a block, implicitly the transaction tax, plus the fees had to be greater than the maximum value of the transactions in it. The total transaction cost (reward + fee) typically peaks around 1.8% but is normally between 0.6% and 0.8%, or around 150 times less than Budish's safety criterion. The result is that a conspiracy between a few large pools could find it economic to mount a 51% attack.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secured by Proof-of-Work (2)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, ∆attack is something of a “pick your poison” parameter. If ∆attack is small, then the system is vulnerable to the double-spending attack ... and the implicit transactions tax on economic activity using the blockchain has to be high. If ∆attack is large, then a short time period of access to a large amount of computing power can sabotage the blockchain. &lt;/p&gt; But everyone assumes the pools won't do that. Budish further analyzed the effects of a multiple spend attack. It would be public, so it would in effect be sabotage, decreasing the Bitcoin price by a factor ∆attack. He concludes that if the decrease is small, then double-spending attacks are feasible and the per-block reward plus fee must be large, whereas if it is large then access to the hash power of a few large pools can quickly sabotage the currency.&lt;quote&gt;Eric Budish: The Economic Limits Of Bitcoin And The Blockchain&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication is that miners, motivated to keep fees manageable, believe ∆attack is large. Thus Bitcoin is secure because those who could kill the golden goose don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secured by Proof-of-Work (3)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; proof-of-work can only achieve payment security if mining income is high, but the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of income. ... the economic design of the transaction market fails to generate high enough fees. &lt;/p&gt; The following year, in Beyond the doomsday economics of “proof-of-work” in cryptocurrencies, Raphael Auer of the Bank for International Settlements showed that the problem Budish identified was inevitable[12]:&lt;quote&gt;Raphael Auer: Beyond the doomsday economics of “proof-of-work” in cryptocurrencies&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;proof-of-work can only achieve payment security if mining income is high, but the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of income. ... the economic design of the transaction market fails to generate high enough fees.In other words, the security of Bitcoin's blockchain depends upon inflating the currency with block rewards. This problem is excerbated by Bitcoin's regular "halvenings" reducing the block reward. To maintain miner's current income after the next halvening in less than three years the "price" would need to be over $200K; security depends upon the "price" appreciating faster than 20%/year.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the block reward gets small, safety requires the fees in a block to be worth more than the value of the transactions in it. But everybody has decided to ignore Budish and Auer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secured by Proof-of-Work (4)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Farokhnia Table 1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;quote&gt;showed that (i) a successful block-reverting attack does not necessarily require ... a majority of the hash power; (ii) obtaining a majority of the hash power ... costs roughly 6.77 billion ... and (iii) Bitcoin derivatives, i.e. options and futures, imperil Bitcoin’s security by creating an incentive for a block-reverting/majority attack.They assume that an attacker would purchase enough state-of-the-art hardware for the attack. Given Bitmain's dominance in mining ASICs, such a purchase is unlikely to be feasible.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secured by Proof-of-Work (5)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Ferreira Table 1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;quote&gt;As of March 2021, the pools in Table 1 collectively accounted for 86% of the total hash rate employed. All but one pool (Binance) have known links to Bitmain Technologies, the largest mining ASIC producer.

You control this entry, but what you own is a claim on the bank[16]. Similarly, your cryptocurrency coins are effectively an entry in a public ledger tagged with the public half of a key pair. The two differences are that:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;No ownership is involved, so you have no recourse if something goes wrong.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Anyone who knows the secret half of the key pair controls the entry. Since it is extremely difficult to stop online secrets leaking, something is likely to go wrong[17].&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;XKCD #538&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secured by cryptography (2)&lt;/head&gt;Even perfect opsec may not be enough. Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies use two cryptographic algorithms, SHA256 for hashing and ECDSA for signatures.&lt;p&gt; Quote from: llama on July 01, 2010, 10:21:47 PM&lt;/p&gt; On 10th July 2010 Nakamoto addressed the issue of what would happen if either of these algorithms were compromised. There are three problems with his response; that compromise is likely in the near future, when it does Nakamoto's fix is inadequate, and there is a huge incentive for it to happen suddenly:&lt;quote&gt;Satoshi, That would indeed be a solution if SHA was broken (certainly the more likely meltdown), because we could still recognize valid money owners by their signature (their private key would still be secure).True, if it happened suddenly. If it happens gradually, we can still transition to something stronger. When you run the upgraded software for the first time, it would re-sign all your money with the new stronger signature algorithm. (by creating a transaction sending the money to yourself with the stronger sig)&lt;lb/&gt;However, if something happened and the signatures were compromised (perhaps integer factorization is solved, quantum computers?), then even agreeing upon the last valid block would be worthless.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto: 10th July 2010&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Secured by cryptography (3)&lt;/head&gt;Divesh Aggarwal et al's 2019 paper Quantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them noted that:&lt;quote&gt;the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates.Their "most optimistic estimates" are likely to be correct; PsiQuantum expects to have two 1M qubit computers operational in 2027[19]. Each should be capable of breaking an ECDSA key in under a week.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin's transition to post-quantum cryptography faces a major problem because, to transfer coins from an ECDSA wallet to a post-quantum wallet, you need the key for the ECDSA wallet. Chainalysis estimates that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;about 20% of all Bitcoins have been "lost", or in other words are sitting in wallets whose keys are inaccessibleAn example is the notorious hard disk in the garbage dump. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could recover the lost keys.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incentive for it to happen suddenly is that, even if Nakamoto's fix were in place, someone with access to the first sufficiently powerful quantum computer could transfer 20% of all Bitcoin, currently worth $460B, to post-quantum wallets they controlled. This would be a 230x return on the investment in PsiQuantum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Privacy-preserving&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.&lt;lb/&gt;As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.&lt;lb/&gt;Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.&lt;/p&gt; Nakamoto addressed the concern that, unlike DigiCash, because Bitcoin's blockchain was public it wasn't anonymous:&lt;p&gt;As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Satoshi Nakamoto: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.This is true but misleading. In practice, users need to use exchanges and other services that can tie them to a public key. There is a flourishing ecosystem of companies that deanonymize wallets by tracing the web of transactions. Nakamoto added:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.This advice is just unrealistic. As Molly White wrote[20]:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;funds in a wallet have to come from somewhere, and it’s not difficult to infer what might be happening when your known wallet address suddenly transfers money off to a new, empty wallet.Nakamoto acknowledged:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.For more than a decade Jamison Lopp has been tracking what happens when a wallet with significant value is deanonymized, and it is a serious risk to life and limbs[21].&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;One more risk&lt;/head&gt;I have steered clear of the financial risks of cryptocurrencies. It may appear that the endorsement of the current administration has effectively removed their financial risk. But the technical and operational risks remain, and I should note another technology-related risk.&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is likely to be an epic AI equity bust. Analogies are being drawn to the telecom boom, but The Economist reckons[23]:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;the potential AI bubble lags behind only the three gigantic railway busts of the 19th century.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Source&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;The fascinating thing about cryptocurrency technology is the number of ways people have developed and how much they are willing to pay to avoid actually using it. What other transformative technology has had people desperate not to use it?&lt;p&gt;The whole of TradFi has been erected on this much worse infrastructure, including exchanges, closed-end funds, ETFs, rehypothecation, and derivatives. Clearly, the only reason for doing so is to escape regulation and extract excess profits from what would otherwise be crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt; The cause was the video of a talk I gave at Stanford in 2022 entitled Can We Mitigate The Externalities Of Cryptocurrencies?. It was an updated version of a talk at the 2021 TTI/Vanguard conference. The talk conformed to Betteridge's Law of Headlines in that the answer was "no".&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Paper libraries form a model fault-tolerant system. It is highly replicated and decentralized. Libraries cooperate via inter-library loan and copy to deliver a service that is far more reliable than any individual library.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The importance Satoshi Nakamoto attached to trustlessness can be seen from his release note for Bitcoin 0.1: &lt;quote&gt;The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.&lt;/quote&gt;The problem with this ideology is that trust (but verify) is an incredibly effective optimization in almost any system. For example, Robert Putnam et al's Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy shows that the difference between the economies of Northern and Southern Italy is driven by the much higher level of trust in the North.&lt;lb/&gt;Bitcoin's massive cost is a result of its lack of trust. Users pay this massive cost but they don't get a trustless system, they just get a system that makes the trust a bit harder to see.&lt;lb/&gt;In response to Nakamoto's diatribe, note that:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;"trusted not to debase the currency", but Bitcoin's security depends upon debasing the currency.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;"waves of credit bubbles", is a pretty good description of the cryptocurrency market.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;"not to let identity thieves drain our accounts", see Molly White's Web3 is Going Just Great.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;"massive overhead costs". The current cost per transaction is around $100.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The problem of trusting mining pools is actually much worse. There is nothing to stop pools &lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;conspiring&lt;/del&gt;coordinating. In 2017 Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, published The Meaning of Decentralization:&lt;quote&gt;In the case of blockchain protocols, the mathematical and economic reasoning behind the safety of the consensus often relies crucially on the uncoordinated choice model, or the assumption that the game consists of many small actors that make decisions independently. If any one actor gets more than 1/3 of the mining power in a proof of work system, they can gain outsized profits by selfish-mining. However, can we really say that the uncoordinated choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at the same conference?&lt;/quote&gt;See "Sufficiently Decentralized" for a review of evidence from a Protos article entitled New research suggests Bitcoin mining centralized around Bitmain that concludes:&lt;quote&gt;In all, it seems unlikely that up to nine major bitcoin mining pools use a shared custodian for coinbase rewards unless a single entity is behind all of their operations.&lt;/quote&gt;The "single entity" is clearly Bitmain.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Peter Ryan, a reformed Bitcoin enthusiast, noted another form of centralization in Money by Vile Means:&lt;quote&gt;Bitcoin is anything but decentralized: Its functionality is maintained by a small and privileged clique of software developers who are funded by a centralized cadre of institutions. If they wanted to change Bitcoin’s 21 million coin finite supply, they could do it with the click of a keyboard.&lt;/quote&gt;His account of the politics behind the argument over raising the Bitcoin block size should dispel any idea of Bitcoin's decentralized nature. He also notes:&lt;quote&gt;By one estimate from Hashrate Index, Foundry USA and Singapore-based AntPool control more than 50 percent of computing power, and the top ten mining pools control over 90 percent. Bitcoin blogger 0xB10C, who analyzed mining data as of April 15, 2025, found that centralization has gone even further than this, “with only six pools mining more than 95 percent of the blocks.”&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The Bitmain S17 comes in 4 versions with hash rates from 67 to 76 TH/s. Lets assume 70TH/s. As I write the Bitcoin hash rate is about 1 billion TH/s. So if they were all mid-range S17s there would be around 15M mining. If their economic life were 18 months, there would be 77,760 rewards. Thus only 0.5% of them would earn a reward.&lt;lb/&gt;In December 2021 Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll estimated that:&lt;quote&gt;The average time to become unprofitable sums up to less than 1.29 years.&lt;/quote&gt;It has been obvious since mining ASICs first hit the market that, apart from access to cheap or free electricity, there were two keys to profitable mining:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Having close enough ties to Bitmain to get the latest chips early in their 18-month economic life.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Having the scale to buy Bitmain chips in the large quantities that get you early access.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; See David Gerard's account of Steve Early's experiences accepting Bitcoin in his chain of pubs in Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain Page 94.&lt;table/&gt;U.S. Consumers’ Use of Cryptocurrency for Payments by Fumiko Hayashi and Aditi Routh of the Kansas City Fed reports that:&lt;td&gt;Chart 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The share of U.S. consumers who report using cryptocurrency for payments—purchases, money transfers, or both—has been very small and has declined slightly in recent years. The light blue line in Chart 1 shows that this share declined from nearly 3 percent in 2021 and 2022 to less than 2 percent in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; User DeathAndTaxes on Stack Exchange explains the 6 block rule:&lt;quote&gt;p is the chance of attacker eventually getting longer chain and reversing a transaction (0.1% in this case). q is the % of the hashing power the attacker controls. z is the number of blocks to put the risk of a reversal below p (0.1%).&lt;/quote&gt;For example, last May Foundry USA had more than 30% of the hash power, so the rule should have been 24 not 6, and finality should have taken 4 hours.&lt;lb/&gt;So you can see if the attacker has a small % of the hashing power 6 blocks is sufficient. Remember 10% of the network at the time of writing is ~100GH/s. However if the attacker had greater % of hashing power it would take increasingly longer to be sure a transaction can't be reversed.&lt;lb/&gt;If the attacker had significantly more hashpower say 25% of the network it would require 15 confirmation to be sure (99.9% probability) that an attacker can't reverse it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; To be fair, Ethereum has introduced at least one genuine innovation, Flash Loans. In Flash loans, flash attacks, and the future of DeFi Aidan Saggers, Lukas Alemu and Irina Mnohoghitnei of the Bank of England provide an excellent overview of them. Back in 2021 Kaihua Qin, Liyi Zhou, Benjamin Livshits, and Arthur Gervais from Imperial College posted Attacking the defi ecosystem with flash loans for fun and profit, analyzing and optimizing two early flash loan attacks:&lt;quote&gt;We show quantitatively how transaction atomicity increases the arbitrage revenue. We moreover analyze two existing attacks with ROIs beyond 500k%. We formulate finding the attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the underlying Ethereum blockchain and the state of the DeFi ecosystem. We show how malicious adversaries can efficiently maximize an attack profit and hence damage the DeFi ecosystem further. Specifically, we present how two previously executed attacks can be “boosted” to result in a profit of 829.5k USD and 1.1M USD, respectively, which is a boost of 2.37× and 1.73×, respectively.&lt;/quote&gt;They predicted an upsurge in attacks since "flash loans democratize the attack, opening this strategy to the masses". They were right, as you can see from Molly White's list of flash loan attacks.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This is one of a whole series of Impossibilities, many imposed on Ethereum by fundamental results in computer science because it is a Turing-complete programming environment.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; For details of the story behind Miners' Extractable Value (MEV), see these posts:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Order Flow from November 2020.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ethereum Has Issues from April 2022.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Miners' Extractable Value From September 2022.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;table/&gt;The first links to two must-read posts. The first is from Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos, Ethereum is a Dark Forest:&lt;td&gt;Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;quote&gt;It’s no secret that the Ethereum blockchain is a highly adversarial environment. If a smart contract can be exploited for profit, it eventually will be. The frequency of new hacks indicates that some very smart people spend a lot of time examining contracts for vulnerabilities.&lt;/quote&gt;The second is from Samczsun, Escaping the Dark Forest. It is an account of how:&lt;lb/&gt;But this unforgiving environment pales in comparison to the mempool (the set of pending, unconfirmed transactions). If the chain itself is a battleground, the mempool is something worse: a dark forest.&lt;quote&gt;On September 15, 2020, a small group of people worked through the night to rescue over 9.6MM USD from a vulnerable smart contract.&lt;/quote&gt;Note in particular that MEV poses a risk to the integrity of blockchains. In Extracting Godl [sic] from the Salt Mines: Ethereum Miners Extracting Value Julien Piet, Jaiden Fairoze and Nicholas Weaver examine the use of transactions that avoid the mempool, finding that:&lt;quote&gt;(i) 73% of private transactions hide trading activity or re-distribute miner rewards, and 87.6% of MEV collection is accomplished with privately submitted transactions, (ii) our algorithm finds more than $6M worth of MEV profit in a period of 12 days, two thirds of which go directly to miners, and (iii) MEV represents 9.2% of miners' profit from transaction fees.&lt;/quote&gt;When they say "large miners" they mean more than 10% of the power.&lt;lb/&gt;Furthermore, in those 12 days, we also identify four blocks that contain enough MEV profits to make time-bandit forking attacks economically viable for large miners, undermining the security and stability of Ethereum as a whole.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Back in 2016 Arvind Narayanan's group at Princeton had published a related instability in Carlsten et al's On the instability of bitcoin without the block reward. Narayanan summarized the paper in a blog post:&lt;quote&gt;Our key insight is that with only transaction fees, the variance of the miner reward is very high due to the randomness of the block arrival time, and it becomes attractive to fork a “wealthy” block to “steal” the rewards therein.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The leading source of data on which to base Bitcoin's carbon footprint is the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. As I write their central estimate is that Bitcoin consumes 205TWh/year, or between Thailand and Vietnam.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Ferreira et al write:&lt;quote&gt;AntPool and BTC.com are fully-owned subsidiaries of Bitmain. Bitmain is the largest investor in ViaBTC. Both F2Pool and BTC.TOP are partners of BitDeer, which is a Bitmain-sponsored cloud-mining service. The parent companies of Huobi.pool and OkExPool are strategic partners of Bitmain. Jihan Wu, Bitmain’s founder and chairman, is also an adviser of Huobi (one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and the owner of Huobi.pool).&lt;/quote&gt;This makes economic sense. Because mining rigs depreciate quickly, profit depends upon early access to the latest chips.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;See Who Is Mining Bitcoin? for more detail on the state of mining and its gradual obfuscation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;In this context to say you "control" your entry in the bank's ledger is an oversimplification. You can instruct the bank to perform transactions against your entry (and no-one else's) but the bank can reject your instructions. For example if they would overdraw your account, or send money to a sanctioned account. The key point is that your ownership relationship with the bank comes with a dispute resolution system and the ability to reverse transactions. Your cryptocurrency wallet has neither.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Web3 is Going Just Great is Molly White's list of things that went wrong. The cumulative losses she tracks currently stand at over $79B.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Your secrets are especially at risk if anyone in your software supply chain use a build system implemented using AI "vibe coding".

The split checks with all of your previous Tinder dates? That monthly transfer to your therapist? The debts you’re paying off (or not), the charities to which you’re donating (or not), the amount you’re putting in a retirement account (or not)? The location of that corner store right by your apartment where you so frequently go to grab a pint of ice cream at 10pm? Not only would this all be visible to that one-off Tinder date, but also to your ex-partners, your estranged family members, your prospective employers. An abusive partner could trivially see you siphoning funds to an account they can’t control as you prepare to leave them.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; In The Risks Of HODL-ing I go into the details of the attack on the parents of Veer Chetal, who had unwisely live-streamed the social engineering that stole $243M from a resident of DC.&lt;lb/&gt;Anyone with significant cryptocurrency wallets needs to follow Jamison Lopp's Known Physical Bitcoin Attacks.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;table/&gt;Torsten Sløk's AI Has Moved From a Niche Sector to the Primary Driver of All VC Investment leads with this graph, one of the clearest signs that we're in a bubble.&lt;td&gt;Source&lt;/td&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Whether AI delivers net value in most cases is debatable. "Vibe coding" is touted as the example of increasing productivity, but the experimental evidence is that it decreases productivity. Kate Niederhoffer et al's Harvard Business Review article AI-Generated "Workslop” Is Destroying Productivity explains one effect:&lt;quote&gt;Employees are using AI tools to create low-effort, passable looking work that ends up creating more work for their coworkers. On social media, which is increasingly clogged with low-quality AI-generated posts, this content is often referred to as “AI slop.” In the context of work, we refer to this phenomenon as “workslop.” We define workslop as AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.&lt;/quote&gt;David Gerard's Workslop: bad ‘study’, but an excellent word points out that:&lt;lb/&gt;Here’s how this happens. As AI tools become more accessible, workers are increasingly able to quickly produce polished output: well-formatted slides, long, structured reports, seemingly articulate summaries of academic papers by non-experts, and usable code. But while some employees are using this ability to polish good work, others use it to create content that is actually unhelpful, incomplete, or missing crucial context about the project at hand. The insidious effect of workslop is that it shifts the burden of the work downstream, requiring the receiver to interpret, correct, or redo the work. In other words, it transfers the effort from creator to receiver.&lt;quote&gt;Unfortunately, this article pretends to be a writeup of a study — but it’s actually a promotional brochure for enterprise AI products. It’s an unlabeled advertising feature.&lt;/quote&gt;And goes on to explain where the workslop comes from:&lt;quote&gt;Well, you know how you get workslop — it’s when your boss mandates you use AI. He can’t say what he wants you to use it for. But you’ve been told. You’ve got metrics on how much AI you use. They’re watching and they’re measuring.&lt;/quote&gt;Belle Lin and Steven Rosenbush's Stop Worrying About AI’s Return on Investment describes goalposts being moved:&lt;quote&gt;Return on investment has evaded chief information officers since AI started moving from early experimentation to more mature implementations last year. But while AI is still rapidly evolving, CIOs are recognizing that traditional ways of recognizing gains from the technology aren’t cutting it.&lt;/quote&gt;Given the hype and the massive sunk costs, admitting that there is no there there would be a career-limiting move.&lt;lb/&gt;Tech leaders at the WSJ Leadership Institute’s Technology Council Summit on Tuesday said racking up a few minutes of efficiency here and there don’t add up to a meaningful way of measuring ROI.&lt;lb/&gt;None of this takes account of the productivity externalities of AI, such as Librarians Are Being Asked to Find AI-Hallucinated Books, academic journals' reviewers' time wasted by AI slop papers, judges' time wasted with hallucinated citations, a flood of generated child sex abuse videos, the death of social media and a vast new cyberthreat landscape.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; The Economist writes in What if the AI stockmarket blows up?:&lt;quote&gt;we picked ten historical bubbles and assessed them on factors including spark, cumulative capex, capex durability and investor group. By our admittedly rough-and-ready reckoning, the potential AI bubble lags behind only the three gigantic railway busts of the 19th century.&lt;/quote&gt;They note that:&lt;quote&gt;For now, the splurge looks fairly modest by historical standards. According to our most generous estimate, American AI firms have invested 3-4% of current American GDP over the past four years. British railway investment during the 1840s was around 15-20% of GDP. But if forecasts for data-centre construction are correct, that will change. What is more, an unusually large share of capital investment is being devoted to assets that depreciate quickly. Nvidia’s cutting-edge chips will look clunky in a few years’ time. We estimate that the average American tech firm’s assets have a shelf-life of just nine years, compared with 15 for telecoms assets in the 1990s.&lt;/quote&gt;I think they are over-estimating the shelf-life. Like Bitcoin mining, power is a major part of AI opex. Thus the incentive to (a) retire older, less power-efficient hardware, and (b) adopt the latest data-center power technology, is overwhelming. Note that Nvidia is moving to a one-year product cadence, and even when they were on a two-year cadence Jensen claimed it wasn't worth running chips from the previous cycle. Note also that the current generation of AI systems is incompatible with the power infrastructure of older data centers, and this may well happen again in a future product generation. For example, Caiwei Chen reports in China built hundreds of AI data centers to catch the AI boom. Now many stand unused:&lt;quote&gt;The local Chinese outlets Jiazi Guangnian and 36Kr report that up to 80% of China’s newly built computing resources remain unused.&lt;/quote&gt;Rogé Karma makes the same point as The Economist in Just How Bad Would an AI Bubble Be?:&lt;quote&gt;An AI-bubble crash could be different. AI-related investments have already surpassed the level that telecom hit at the peak of the dot-com boom as a share of the economy. In the first half of this year, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth than all consumer spending combined. Many experts believe that a major reason the U.S. economy has been able to weather tariffs and mass deportations without a recession is because all of this AI spending is acting, in the words of one economist, as a “massive private sector stimulus program.” An AI crash could lead broadly to less spending, fewer jobs, and slower growth, potentially dragging the economy into a recession.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;In 2021 Nicholas Weaver estimated that the Ethereum computer was 5000 times slower than a Raspberry Pi 4. Since then the gas limit has been raised making his current estimate only 1000 times slower.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Prof. Hilary Allen writes in Fintech Dystopia that:&lt;quote&gt;if people do start dumping blockchain-based assets in fire sales, everyone will know immediately because the blockchain is publicly visible. This level of transparency will only add to the panic (at least, that’s what happened during the run on the Terra stablecoin in 2022).&lt;/quote&gt;She adds:&lt;lb/&gt;...&lt;lb/&gt;We also saw ... that assets on a blockchain can be pre-programmed to execute transactions without the intervention of any human being. In good times, this makes things more efficient – but the code will execute just as quickly in bad situations, even if everyone would be better off if it didn’t.&lt;quote&gt;When things are spiraling out of control like this, sometimes the best medicine is a pause. Lots of traditional financial markets close at the end of the day and on weekends, which provides a natural opportunity for a break (and if things are really bad, for emergency government intervention). But one of blockchain-based finance’s claims to greater efficiency is that operations continue 24/7. We may end up missing the pauses once they’re gone.&lt;/quote&gt;In the 26th September Grant's, Joel Wallenberg notes that:&lt;quote&gt;Lucrative though they may be, the problem with stablecoin deposits is that exposure to the crypto-trading ecosystem makes them inherently correlated to it and subject to runs in a new “crypto winter,” like that of 2022–23. Indeed, since as much as 70% of gross stablecoin-transaction volume derives from automated arbitrage bots and high-speed trading algorithms, runs may be rapid and without human over-sight. What may be worse, the insured banks that could feed a stablecoin boom are the very ones that are likely to require taxpayer support if liquidity dries up, and Trump-style regulation is likely to be light.&lt;/quote&gt;So the loophole in the GENIUS act for banks is likely to cause contagion from cryptocurrencies via stablecoins to the US banking system.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How we built blockdiff, an open-source tool for rapid block-level diffs and snapshots of VM disks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We made it open-source here: https://github.com/CognitionAI/blockdiff&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, I’m a researcher working on areas like RL for coding agents – but one day I became annoyed by our slow VM startup times. So I took the plunge into systems engineering and built the first version of our VM hypervisor called &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;. It now powers both our research &amp;amp; all of Devin production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devin writes and runs code in a VM environment. Why VMs instead of Docker? For untrusted user workloads we require full isolation for security purposes. Moreover, many realistic dev environments require using Docker (e.g. to spin up a backend service or database). Good luck running Docker inside Docker, so we needed VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to EC2, &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt; was able to bring down VM startup times by about 10x. The real pain point, however, were EC2’s long snapshot times. We want a lot of flexibility (e.g. forking, rollback and suspending VMs) that all require taking disk snapshots. On EC2 taking disk snapshots usually took a whopping 30+ minutes, which would be a terrible experience for our users. With &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt; we were able to bring this down to just a couple of seconds – a 200x speed-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we built our own file format &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; for instant block-level diffs of VM disks. Creating block-level diffs of two files is a much broader problem that goes beyond VM disks. We assumed there must be an existing open-source solution. To our surprise we couldn’t find such a tool, so we’re open-sourcing our implementation today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three reasons why we want incremental snapshots of VM disks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dev environments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our customers set up their dev environment in Devin’s VM, which we save to reuse via a disk snapshot. If most customers use just 1GB of additional disk space, we don’t want all the snapshots to redundantly store the entire 15GB operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sleep &amp;amp; wake up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Devin sleeps, we want to store the current session state without making another copy of the dev environment. The limiting factor isn’t even storage cost – it’s wake up time. Transferring a 50 MB snapshot of session state is much faster than a multi-GB snapshot of the entire dev environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disk rollback&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable rolling back the disk during a session, we want to stack many of these incremental snapshots on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried very hard to find a way to implement disk snapshotting while satisfying all these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compact&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The snapshot file should grow proportional to the difference between the base image and the VM disk. It’s too expensive to snapshot the entire disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instantaneous&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a snapshot should be instant and should not require significant disk I/O. We design our file format so that creating snapshot operates mostly on file metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zero overhead&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VM should not experience any overhead, e.g. slower reads or writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplicity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things like this can easily break and have thousands of edge cases, so we want a solution that’s as simple as possible, to spare ourselves lots of debugging time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implementation of the file format is a single, few-hundred line Rust file. It stands on the shoulders of giants: most of the complexity is handled by the Linux kernel’s excellent CoW implementation in the XFS filesystem. The core idea is simple: For two files A &amp;amp; B, &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; stores only the blocks in B that are different from blocks in A.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explain the difficulty of achieving all these design goals, let’s first explain the limitations of other solutions we considered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not just read the files and compute a binary diff?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to compute a binary diff directly based on file content would be quite slow. Even on the fastest SSDs, scanning an entire 128 GB disk image can take 30-60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not OverlayFS?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first few weeks of &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;’s existence we used OverlayFS. However, it had two issues: It didn’t have clean support for incremental snapshots without remounting. Moreover, it created big issues when users wanted to use Docker – which would fall back to the vfs storage driver, consume 17x more storage and be 6x slower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why not ZFS?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we started using &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;, we had implemented a version of rollback using ZFS inside of the VM. It had multiple limitations: For reliability reasons, we mounted ZFS only on the home dir, so it wasn’t possible to roll back system-level changes like package installs. Moreover, the snapshot logic had to live inside of the VM, visible to the user. We also briefly considered using ZFS outside of the VM on the hypervisor. However, we concluded that the end-to-end performance of creating &amp;amp; transferring ZFS snapshots (send/recv) seemed to most likely be lower than what we can achieve with &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the qcow2 file format?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We didn’t deeply consider qcow2 because our hypervisor only supports raw disk images. Further below in the bonus section, we show a performance comparison that shows an example of &lt;code&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/code&gt; becoming quite slow for large files. Evidently, qcow2 doesn’t operate on metadata only (unlike &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s first explain two Linux concepts that are necessary to understand the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparse files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparse files only allocate disk space for non-zero data. This is particularly helpful for VM disk images that have mostly unused space. For a sparse file, the logical size of the file is different from the actual disk usage. In this example, &lt;code&gt;ls -hl disk.img&lt;/code&gt; shows the logical size which is 32GB. However, it only uses 261 MB of actual disk space – which you can see with &lt;code&gt;du -h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ubuntu@devin-box:~$ ls -hl disk.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 32G Jan  9 07:57 disk.img
ubuntu@devin-box:~$ du -h disk.img
261M    disk.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can create an empty sparse file with &lt;code&gt;truncate -s&lt;/code&gt; and then format it as an &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; disk image using &lt;code&gt;mkfs.ext4&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ubuntu@devin-box:~$ truncate -s 32G disk.img
ubuntu@devin-box:~$ mkfs.ext4 disk.img

    &lt;p&gt;Copy-on-write (CoW)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy-on-write is a feature supported by many modern Linux filesystems (XFS, ZFS, btrfs). Instead of immediately copying data when requested, the system shares the original data and only creates a separate copy when modifications are made to either the original or the copy. This bookkeeping happens on a block-by-block basis: blocks are the fundamental unit of storage of modern file systems and typically 4KB in size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the difference between copying a file with &amp;amp; without “reflink” (another name for copy-on-write) for a 128GB disk image on a very fast NVMe SSD:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ubuntu@devin-box:~$ time cp --reflink=never base.img vm1.img

real    0m24.532s
user    0m0.142s

real    0m0.008s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.004s&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disk images as files&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our hypervisor &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt;, VM disks are just files on its filesystem. Each VM disk is a CoW copy of the base disk image (e.g. the operating system) – which means that it shares all blocks by default and greedily allocates new blocks on write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s important to differentiate between the filesystem inside &amp;amp; outside of the VMs: Inside our VMs we use ext4 as the filesystem because it’s most widespread and the default on Ubuntu. Outside, the hypervisor uses XFS as its filesystem – crucially with reflink (= copy-on-write) enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have two files: &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt; is a disk image of our operating system and &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt; is a CoW copy of &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt;. The VM is reading &amp;amp; writing from &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt;. Our goal is to create a separate file &lt;code&gt;snapshot.bdiff&lt;/code&gt; that stores only the blocks from &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt; that are different from &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;File extent maps&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our objective is to only operate on the filesystem metadata and to never touch the actual contents of the files. To be precise, the key lies in the file extent maps which you can get using the FIEMAP syscall. The &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; tool can be used to view the syscall outputs in a nicely formatted way (or alternatively use the Linux utility &lt;code&gt;filefrag -v disk.img&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;blockdiff view disk.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The file extent map represents the mapping from logical blocks in the file to physical blocks on the hard drive. This mapping is grouped in extents which are sequences of blocks that are allocated contiguously. You might’ve heard of the word (de)fragmentation before: In an ideal world, every file would just be a single extent, stored as one contiguous chunk on the hard drive. However, due to fragmentation files usually end up split across multiple extents scattered throughout the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading file extent maps from Rust&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;fiemap&lt;/code&gt; crate in Rust we have a clean wrapper around the underlying Linux syscall FIEMAP IOCTL. Getting the extents of the target file is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;let mut target_extents: Vec&amp;lt;_&amp;gt; = fiemap::fiemap(target_file)?.collect::&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each extent looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pub struct FiemapExtent {
    pub fe_logical: u64, // logical offset (in bytes)
    pub fe_physical: u64, // physical offset (in bytes)
    pub fe_length: u64, // length of extent (in bytes)
    pub fe_flags: FiemapExtentFlags,
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The logical block addresses are the location of data in the file (i.e. in our VM disk). The physical block addresses are where the data is stored on the hypervisor disk. An extent is a sequence of contiguous logical blocks with contiguous physical addresses. If two logical blocks from different files, point to the same physical blocks, then they are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise for the reader: Write an algorithm that takes in file extent map A &amp;amp; B and returns a list of extents from B that are different from A. Be careful that extent boundaries are in general not aligned between A &amp;amp; B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining a file format (.bdiff)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the last step is to serialize this into a file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/// - Header:
///   - 8 bytes: magic string ("BDIFFv1\0")
///   - 8 bytes: target file size (little-endian)
///   - 8 bytes: base file size (little-endian)
///   - 8 bytes: number of ranges (little-endian)
///   - Ranges array, each range containing:
///     - 8 bytes: logical offset (little-endian)
///     - 8 bytes: length (little-endian)
/// - Padding to next block boundary (4 KiB)
/// - Range data (contiguous blocks of data)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small header contains information about which logical block ranges the file contains. After that, it stores all differing blocks contiguously. When creating (or applying) blockdiffs, writing the small header is the only disk I/O that needs to happen. All the actual data can share the same physical blocks with &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. creating the rest of the file is purely a “rewiring” of file metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exercise for the reader: What piece in the blockdiff codebase is responsible for the fact that the range data shares the same physical blocks as &lt;code&gt;vm.img&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install and build the binary:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/cognitionai/blockdiff &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd blockdiff
cargo install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder that we need to be on a filesystem with reflink enabled (e.g. XFS). Now, let’s create a snapshot of &lt;code&gt;vm1.img&lt;/code&gt; against the base image &lt;code&gt;base.img&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;blockdiff create snapshot.bdiff vm1.img --base base.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use that snapshot, to create a new disk image &lt;code&gt;vm2.img:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;blockdiff apply snapshot.bdiff vm2.img --base base.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This file should be identical to &lt;code&gt;vm1.img&lt;/code&gt;. We can verify this with hashes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;xxhsum vm1.img
xxhsum vm2.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this is only a file metadata operation, creating and applying snapshots is effectively instant – no matter how large the disk images. After creating the snapshot file locally, the file still needs to be transferred to storage which happens with about 2 GB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;On our hypervisor machines:
Reading/writing 20 GB of data: ~6.5 s
Creating 20 GB snapshot with blockdiff: ~200 ms&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fun little challenge that we faced while building &lt;code&gt;otterlink&lt;/code&gt; is “compactifying” sparse files. If you try to upload a sparse disk image to blob storage, it will upload the entire logical size since blob storage doesn’t natively understand sparse files. So we were looking for a way to turn a sparse file of logical size X &amp;gt; disk usage Y into a “compact” file with logical size Y = disk usage Y.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most online sources seemed to recommend using tar which ended up being extremely slow. You would usually expect network latency to be the main bottleneck but it turned out tar would be 5x slower than the network transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite not using qcow2 in our hypervisor itself, it turned out that &lt;code&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/code&gt; gave us exactly what we wanted: converting a raw, sparse disk image into a compact one. Moreover, it did it 5x faster than tar. To be clear, this was a random hack of ours and it isn’t what &lt;code&gt;qemu-img convert&lt;/code&gt; is intended to be used for. However, with larger disks it becomes clear that even qcow2 starts being slow – it clearly isn’t a metadata-only operation. Fortunately, &lt;code&gt;blockdiff&lt;/code&gt; is super fast at all sizes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on VM hypervisors was a fun foray into systems programming. Hopefully, this gave you a glimpse of the work we do at Cognition. Of course, there are many more open questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to work on these problems, reach out to us or apply here!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Databricks, Kubernetes is at the heart of our internal systems. Within a single Kubernetes cluster, the default networking primitives like ClusterIP services, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy are often sufficient. They offer a simple abstraction to route service traffic. But when performance and reliability matter, these defaults begin to show their limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll share how we built an intelligent, client-side load balancing system to improve traffic distribution, reduce tail latencies, and make service-to-service communication more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a Databricks user, you don’t need to understand this blog to be able to use the platform to its fullest. But if you’re interested in taking a peek under the hood, read on to hear about some of the cool stuff we’ve been working on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-performance service-to-service communication in Kubernetes has several challenges, especially when using persistent HTTP/2 connections, as we do at Databricks with gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this model generally works, it quickly breaks down in performance-sensitive environments, leading to significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Databricks, we operate hundreds of stateless services communicating over gRPC within each Kubernetes cluster. These services are often high-throughput, latency-sensitive, and run at significant scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default load balancing model falls short in this environment for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These limitations pushed us to rethink how we handle service-to-service communication within a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address the limitations of kube-proxy and default service routing in Kubernetes, we built a proxyless, fully client-driven load balancing system backed by a custom service discovery control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fundamental requirement we had was to support load balancing at the application layer, and removing dependency on the DNS on a critical path. A Layer 4 load balancer, like kube-proxy, cannot make intelligent per-request decisions for Layer 7 protocols (such as gRPC) that utilize persistent connections. This architectural constraint creates bottlenecks, necessitating a more intelligent approach to traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following table summarizes the key differences and the advantages of a client-side approach:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Inefficient (over-provisioning)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Efficient (balanced load)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Dependency on DNS/Proxy&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;High&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Minimal/Minimal, not on a critical path&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Operational Control&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Limited&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fine-grained&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system enables intelligent, up-to-date request routing with minimal dependency on DNS or Layer 4 networking. It gives clients the ability to make informed decisions based on live topology and health data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The figure shows our custom Endpoint Discovery Service in action. It reads service and endpoint data from the Kubernetes API and translates it into xDS responses. Both Armeria clients and API proxies stream requests to it and receive live endpoint metadata, which is then used by application servers for intelligent routing with fallback clusters as backup.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We run a lightweight control plane that continuously monitors the Kubernetes API for changes to Services and EndpointSlices. It maintains an up-to-date view of all backend pods for every service, including metadata like zone, readiness, and shard labels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A strategic advantage for Databricks was the widespread adoption of a common framework for service communication across most of its internal services, which are predominantly written in Scala. This shared foundation allowed us to embed client-side service discovery and load balancing logic directly into the framework, making it easy to adopt across teams without requiring custom implementation effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each service integrates with our custom client, which subscribes to updates from the control plane for the services it depends on during the connection setup. The client maintains a dynamic list of healthy endpoints, including metadata like zone or shard, and updates automatically as the control plane pushes changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the client bypasses both DNS resolution and kube-proxy entirely, it always has a live, accurate view of service topology. This allows us to implement consistent and efficient load balancing strategies across all internal services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rpc client performs request-aware load balancing using strategies like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More advanced strategies, like zone-aware routing, required careful tuning and deeper context about service topology, traffic patterns, and failure modes; a topic to explore in a dedicated follow-up post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we ran extensive simulations, experiments, and real-world metric analysis. We validated that load remained evenly distributed and that key metrics like tail latency, error rate, and cross-zone traffic cost stayed within target thresholds. The flexibility to adapt strategies per-service has been valuable, but in practice, keeping it simple (and consistent) has worked best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our control plane extends its utility beyond the internal service-to-service communication. It plays a crucial role in managing external traffic by speaking the xDS API to Envoy, the discovery protocol that lets clients fetch up-to-date configuration (like clusters, endpoints, and routing rules) dynamically. Specifically, it implements Endpoint Discovery Service (EDS) to provide Envoy with consistent and up-to-date metadata about backend endpoints by programming ClusterLoadAssignment resources. This ensures that gateway-level routing (e.g., for ingress or public-facing traffic) aligns with the same source of truth used by internal clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architecture gives us fine-grained control over routing behavior while decoupling service discovery from the limitations of DNS and kube-proxy. The key takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After deploying our client-side load balancing system, we observed significant improvements across both performance and efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the rollout delivered clear benefits, we also uncovered several challenges and insights along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While developing our client-side load balancing approach, we evaluated other alternative solutions. Here’s why we ultimately decided against these:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kubernetes headless services (clusterIP: None) provide direct pod IPs via DNS, allowing clients and proxies (like Envoy) to perform their own load balancing. This approach bypasses the limitation of connection-based distribution in kube-proxy and enables advanced load balancing strategies offered by Envoy (such as round robin, consistent hashing, and least-loaded round robin).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, switching existing ClusterIP services to headless services (or creating additional headless services using the same selector) would mitigate connection reuse issues by providing clients direct endpoint visibility. However, this approach comes with practical limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although headless services can offer a temporary improvement over ClusterIP services, the practical challenges and limitations made them unsuitable as a long-term solution at Databricks' scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Istio provides powerful Layer 7 load balancing features using Envoy sidecars injected into every pod. These proxies handle routing, retries, circuit breaking, and more - all managed centrally through a control plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this model offers many capabilities, we found it unsuitable for our environment at Databricks for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also evaluated Istio’s Ambient Mesh. Since Databricks already had proprietary systems for functions like certificate distribution, and our routing patterns were relatively static, the added complexity of adopting a full mesh outweighed the benefits. This was especially true for a small infra team supporting a predominantly Scala codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that one of the biggest advantages of sidecar-based meshes is language-agnosticism: teams can standardize resiliency and routing across polyglot services without maintaining client libraries everywhere. At Databricks, however, our environment is heavily Scala-based, and our monorepo plus fast CI/CD culture make the proxyless, client-library approach far more practical. Rather than introducing the operational burden of sidecars, we invested in building first-class load balancing directly into our libraries and infrastructure components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our current client-side load balancing approach has significantly improved internal service-to-service communication. Yet, as Databricks continues to scale, we’re exploring several advanced areas to further enhance our system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-Cluster and Cross-Region Load Balancing: As we manage thousands of Kubernetes clusters across multiple regions, extending intelligent load balancing beyond individual clusters is critical. We are exploring technologies like flat L3 networking and service-mesh solutions, integrating seamlessly with multi-region Endpoint Discovery Service (EDS) clusters. This will enable robust cross-cluster traffic management, fault tolerance, and globally efficient resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advanced Load Balancing Strategies for AI Use Cases: We plan to introduce more sophisticated strategies, such as weighted load balancing, to better support advanced AI workloads. These strategies will enable finer-grained resource allocation and intelligent routing decisions based on specific application characteristics, ultimately optimizing performance, resource consumption, and cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're interested in working on large-scale distributed infrastructure challenges like this, we're hiring. Come build with us — explore open roles at Databricks!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 12 Jun 2025 (v1), last revised 5 Sep 2025 (this version, v3)]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi CSI using a pretrained latent diffusion model&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Eshan Ramesh [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Thu, 12 Jun 2025 11:47:23 UTC (6,672 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Fri, 4 Jul 2025 12:27:28 UTC (6,672 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Fri, 5 Sep 2025 11:39:36 UTC (9,960 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
