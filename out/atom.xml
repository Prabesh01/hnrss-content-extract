    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a "low-end" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Did you find any sweet spot?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google unkills JPEG XL?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick summary of the format’s road to stardom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve written about JPEG XL in the past. First, I noted Google’s move to kill the format in Chromium in favor of the homegrown and inferior AVIF.12 Then, I had a deeper look at the format, and visually compared JPEG XL with AVIF on a handful of images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latter post started with a quick support test:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“If you are browsing this page around 2023, chances are that your browser supports AVIF but does not support JPEG XL.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, here we are at the end of 2025, and this very sentence still holds true. Unless you are one of the 17% of users using Safari3, or are adventurous enough to use a niche browser like Thorium or LibreWolf, chances are you see the AVIF banner in green and the JPEG XL image in black/red.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is, this will change soon. In a dramatic turn of events, the Chromium team has reversed its &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; tag, and has decided to support the format in Blink (the engine behind Chrome/Chromium/Edge). Given Chrome’s position in the browser market share, I predict the format will become a de factor standard for images in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been following JPEG XL since its experimental support in Blink. What started as a promising feature was quickly axed by the team in a bizarre and ridiculous manner. First, they asked the community for feedback on the format. Then, the community responded very positively. And I don’t only mean a couple of guys in their basement. Meta, Intel, Cloudinary, Adobe, &lt;code&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;libvips&lt;/code&gt;, Krita, and many more. After that came the infamous comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;da...@chromium.orgda...@chromium.org&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;#85 Oct 31, 2022 12:34AM&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone for your comments and feedback regarding JPEG XL. We will be removing the JPEG XL code and flag from Chromium for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experimental flags and code should not remain indefinitely&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There is not enough interest from the entire ecosystem to continue experimenting with JPEG XL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new image format does not bring sufficient incremental benefits over existing formats to warrant enabling it by default&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By removing the flag and the code in M110, it reduces the maintenance burden and allows us to focus on improving existing formats in Chrome&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, right, “not enough interest from the entire ecosystem”. Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, following this comment, a steady stream of messages pointed out how wrong that was, from all the organizations mentioned above and many more. People were noticing in blog posts, videos, and social media interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strangely, the following few years have been pretty calm for JPEG XL. However, a few notable events did take place. First, the Firefox team showed interest in a JPEG XL Rust decoder, after describing their stance on the matter as “neutral”. They were concerned about the increased attack surface resulting from including the current 100K+ lines C++ &lt;code&gt;libjxl&lt;/code&gt; reference decoder, even though most of those lines are testing code. In any case, they kind of requested a “memory-safe” decoder. This seems to have kick-started the Rust implementation, jxl-rs, from Google Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To top it off, a couple of weeks ago, the PDF Association announced their intent to adopt JPEG XL as a preferred image format in their PDF specification. The CTO of the PDF Association, Peter Wyatt, expressed their desire to include JPEG XL as the preferred format for HDR content in PDF files.4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chromium’s new stance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this pressure exerted steadily over time made the Chromium team reconsider the format. They tried to kill it in favor of AVIF, but that hasn’t worked out. Rick Byers, on behalf of Chromium, made a comment in the Blink developers Google group about the team welcoming a performant and memory-safe JPEG XL decoder in Chromium. He stated that the change of stance was in light of the positive signs from the community we have exposed above (Safari support, Firefox updating their position, PDF, etc.). Quickly after that, the Chromium issue state was changed from &lt;code&gt;Obsolete&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Assigned&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About JPEG XL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great news for the format, and I believe it will give it the final push for mass adoption. The format is excellent for all kinds of purposes, and I’ll be adopting it pretty much instantly for this and the Gaia Sky website when support is shipped. Some of the features that make it superior to the competition are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lossless re-compression of JPEG images. This means you can re-compress your current JPEG library without losing information and benefit from a ~30% reduction in file size for free. This is a killer feature that no other format has.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for wide gamut and HDR.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for image sizes of up to 1,073,741,823x1,073,741,824. You won’t run out of image space anytime soon. AVIF is ridiculous in this aspect, capping at 8,193x4,320. WebP goes up to 16K2, while the original 1992 JPEG supports 64K2.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 32 bits per channel. No other format (except for the defunct JPEG 2000) offers this.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum of 4,099 channels. Most other formats support 4 or 5, with the exception of JPEG 2000, which supports 16,384.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL is super resilient to generation loss.5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JXL supports progressive decoding, which is essential for web delivery, IMO. WebP or HEIC have no such feature. Progressive decoding in AVIF was added a few years back.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for animation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for alpha transparency.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depth map support.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a full codec feature breakdown, see Battle of the Codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JPEG XL is the future of image formats. It checks all the right boxes, and it checks them well. Support in the overwhelmingly most popular browser engine is probably going to be a crucial stepping stone in the format’s path to stardom. I’m happy that the Chromium team reconsidered their inclusion, but I am sad that it took so long and so much pressure from the community to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ghostty for the web with xterm.js API compatibility — giving you a proper VT100 implementation in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Migrate from xterm by changing your import: &lt;code&gt;@xterm/xterm&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WASM-compiled parser from Ghostty—the same code that runs the native app&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero runtime dependencies, ~400KB WASM bundle&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally created for Mux (a desktop app for isolated, parallel agentic development), but designed to be used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Live Demo on an ephemeral VM (thank you to Greg from disco.cloud for hosting).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;On your computer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;npx @ghostty-web/demo@next&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This starts a local HTTP server with a real shell on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt;. Works best on Linux and macOS.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js is everywhere—VS Code, Hyper, countless web terminals. But it has fundamental issues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Issue&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;xterm.js&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;ghostty-web&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complex scripts (Devanagari, Arabic)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rendering issues&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Proper grapheme handling&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;XTPUSHSGR/XTPOPSGR&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Not supported&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✓ Full support&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;xterm.js reimplements terminal emulation in JavaScript. Every escape sequence, every edge case, every Unicode quirk—all hand-coded. Ghostty's emulator is the same battle-tested code that runs the native Ghostty app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm install ghostty-web&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web aims to be API-compatible with the xterm.js API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { init, Terminal } from 'ghostty-web';

await init();

const term = new Terminal({
  fontSize: 14,
  theme: {
    background: '#1a1b26',
    foreground: '#a9b1d6',
  },
});

term.open(document.getElementById('terminal'));
term.onData((data) =&amp;gt; websocket.send(data));
websocket.onmessage = (e) =&amp;gt; term.write(e.data);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a comprehensive client &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; server example, refer to the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ghostty-web builds from Ghostty's source with a patch to expose additional functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Requires Zig and Bun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun run build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto (author of Ghostty) has been working on &lt;code&gt;libghostty&lt;/code&gt; which makes this all possible. The patches are very minimal thanks to the work the Ghostty team has done, and we expect them to get smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This library will eventually consume a native Ghostty WASM distribution once available, and will continue to provide an xterm.js compatible API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Coder we're big fans of Ghostty, so kudos to that team for all the amazing work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Durin is a library for reading and writing the Dwarf debugging format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It aims to support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading DWARF 5 encoded information from ELF and MachO object files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing DWARF 5 information into ELF and MachO object files.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing DWARF 5 information into assembly files.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In future it could support DWARF 4 or newer versions of the DWARF standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should provide:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-platform: &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt;makes no assumptions about what kind of object file you're working with. Provide your own Buffer or use the&lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;library.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lazy: you can iterate compilation units without parsing their contents. Parse only as many debugging information entry (DIE) trees as you iterate over. &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt;also uses&lt;code&gt;DW_AT_sibling&lt;/code&gt;references to avoid parsing a DIE's children to find it's next sibling where possible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency, run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ opam install durin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And add &lt;code&gt;durin&lt;/code&gt; to your project's &lt;code&gt;dune-project&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;*.opam&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Will Apple turn to Intel for production of its M-series chips in 2027? That’s what supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted on X Friday. Citing his latest industry surveys, Kuo says that Intel’s chances of becoming Apple’s latest “advanced-node supplier… has improved significantly” in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Intel could finally return to Apple computers in 2027&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel could supply Apple’s lowest-end M chips by 2027, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel could supply Apple’s lowest-end M chips by 2027, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any deal with Intel would be significant considering the chipmaker famously missed out on supplying its own processors for the original iPhone. Apple now has a deal with Taiwan-based TSMC to supply silicon chips for its iPhone, iPad and Mac products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kuo says that Apple has a non-disclosure agreement with Intel to acquire the company’s 18AP PDK 0.9.1GA chips. At this point, the company is waiting on Intel to deliver the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit, which is supposed to arrive in the first quarter of 2026. If everything stays on track, Intel could start shipping Apple’s lowest-end M-series processor, built on the 18AP advanced node, sometime in the second or third quarter of 2027, Kuo says. But that timing still depends on how smoothly things go once Apple actually gets the PDK 1.0/1.1 kit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kuo theorizes that a deal with Intel could help Apple demonstrate to the Trump administration that its committed to “buying American” by rerouting its supply chain to include more US-based companies. For Intel, a deal could signal that the company’s worst days are passed. “Looking ahead, the 14A node and beyond could capture more orders from Apple and other tier-one customers, turning Intel’s long-term outlook more positive,” Kuo writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could Apple strike a deal with Intel? And what would happen if it decided to use the chipmaker’s 18AP processors for its entry-level M-series?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;React and Remix Choose Different Futures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bryan Cantrill's talk Platform as a Reflection of Values gave me a lens I didn't know I needed. When platforms diverge, he argued, it's rarely about technical merit. It's about values misalignment. The things that matter most to one community simply rank differently for another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I attended Remix Jam two weeks ago, then spent this past week watching React Conf 2025 videos. I have spent the last decade shipping production code on React and the last two years on Remix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now both ecosystems are shifting, and what seemed like different approaches has become incompatible visions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React Conf's technical announcements were incremental: React 19.2 APIs, View Transitions experiments, the compiler getting more sophisticated. The message was clear: React is listening to the community while accepting complexity on your behalf. Stability, Composability, Capability: those are the values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Remix team announced something else entirely: they're breaking with React. The mental model shifts introduced by &lt;code&gt;use client&lt;/code&gt; and the implementation complexity of Server Components forced a choice. And Remix 3 chose Simplicity. Remix 2 users pay the price; there's no upgrade path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That choice, to sacrifice Stability for Simplicity, makes explicit what was already true: these values cannot coexist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;React's Values: Complexity as Capability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React's stated goal is to "raise the bar for responsive user experience." At React Conf 2025, the team demonstrated what that means in practice. They will accept tremendous complexity on developers' behalf if it delivers better experiences for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React Compiler is the clearest example. It analyzes your code, breaks components into smaller pieces of logic, and automatically optimizes rendering. In Meta's Quest store app, they saw 12% faster load times and interactions that were twice as fast, even though the app was already hand-optimized. The compiler isn't replacing developer skill; it's handling complexity that would be unrealistic to maintain manually. Joe Savona explained the challenge: in context-based apps where "every component has to update" the compiler now skips most of that work automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is React's value proposition: Stability (the compiler works with existing code), Composability (it integrates with concurrent rendering, Suspense, transitions), and Capability (it unlocks performance that manual optimization can't reach). When the team talked about their multi-year exploration into incremental computation, they weren't apologizing for the complexity. They were explaining the price of raising that bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React team knows this makes React complicated. But the bet is clear: React falls on the sword of complexity so developers don't have to. That’s admirable, but it asks developers to trust React's invisible machinery more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Remix's Counter-Values: Simplicity as Liberation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Remix team remembers when React was only a composable rendering library with few primitives. At Remix Jam, Ryan Florence demonstrated what Simplicity looks like when it becomes your organizing principle: explicit over implicit, traceable over automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The clearest example is &lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt;. When Ryan built a live drum machine on stage, every state change was manual: "In this code, the only time anything updates is because I told it to." No automatic reactivity graph, no hidden subscriptions, no debugging why something re-renders unexpectedly. If you're wondering why a component updated, "it's because you told it to somewhere."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This explicitness extends throughout Remix 3's design. Event handling uses the &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; property with native DOM events that bubble through normal DOM. AbortControllers (&lt;code&gt;this.signal&lt;/code&gt;) wire cleanup explicitly. Context doesn't trigger re-renders. You set it, components read it, and you call &lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt; when you want things to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After demonstrating the drum machine, Ryan explained the philosophy: "We've been chasing this idea that you construct things together, change values, and everything does what it's supposed to do. But my experience is getting it set up is difficult, and once it is set up, suddenly when something unexpected happens, you have to unravel it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Michael Jackson demonstrated server rendering with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Frame&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component, he showed how it uses plain HTML as its wire format. React Server Components solve real problems, but Remix believes it can solve them more simply by leaning on the Web Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is Remix's value proposition: Simplicity (explicitly control when things update), Web Platform Alignment (standard events, standard streams, cross-runtime compatibility), and Debuggability (trace every update back to a specific &lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt; call). The team isn't rejecting React's goal of raising the UX bar, but they are rejecting the complexity tax React accepts to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Web Platform: Inevitable or Chosen?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's an irony in using Cantrill's framework to analyze Remix's break from React: the Remix team doesn't see their Web Platform commitment as a values choice at all. They believe they're simply skating to where the puck is going. Every framework will embrace Web Platform APIs eventually. It is only a matter of timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Cantrill's talk shows this is an explicit value choice, not an inevitable destination. He lamented Node.js choosing Approachability over Rigor, adopting Web Platform APIs to make it easier for browser developers to work with server-side JavaScript. The practitioners who brought those APIs to Node were the ones he felt were pushing out his values: robustness, debuggability, operational correctness. For Cantrill, aligning with the Web Platform meant sacrificing engineering rigor for developer convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remix 3 is building itself entirely on those same Web Platform APIs. Streams, fetch, the File API, every platform dependency behaves identically in browsers, Bun, Deno, and Node. Ryan and Michael demonstrated this throughout Remix Jam: standard HTML responses, native DOM events, cross-runtime compatibility. React respects Web Platform APIs too, but treats them as a foundation to build upon. Remix 3 treats them as the destination. This has always been a Remix value, evident in Remix 1 and 2, but Remix 3 makes it absolute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I love Remix for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a huge fan of the open web, but I’m not convinced every server framework will, or should, fully align with the Web Platform. The browser and server live under different constraints that force different tradeoffs. The goal isn’t to erase the seam between them, but to make it visible and intentional. Remix 2 handles this tension elegantly. However, it's a result of taste in where to expose the platform, not an inherent outcome of aligning with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Remix 2 is dead. Long live react-router!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite Remix having one of the best upgrade policies in the industry with future flags, there will be no migration path from Remix 2 to Remix 3. The changes are just too fundamental. At Remix Jam, Michael Jackson was explicit: "We've been working on React Router for a decade now... A lot of people built on React Router. Shopify's built on React Router... We're not just going to abandon that thing." Remix 2 users get a maintained evolutionary path as react-router v7. But Remix 3 is taking the name in the divorce and moving in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Simplicity becomes the organizing principle, Stability becomes negotiable. The new &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; property can't coexist with React's legacy event system. The explicit &lt;code&gt;this.update&lt;/code&gt; API replaces React's hooks entirely. Breaking backward compatibility isn't collateral damage, it's the point. It opens design space for tricks like overloading &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; (giving components an optional second parameter without relying on argument ordering), which feels Simple because it leans into JavaScript's existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alpha is expected by year’s end, with a cohesive package to follow in 2026. But the warning is clear: Remix 3 isn't ready for production anytime soon. Everything is new and subject to change. In the meantime, we have react-router.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Open Questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaning on events as a communication backbone is clever, but it reminds me of complex Backbone.js apps that relied on a shared event bus to communicate across components. It worked for a time, but at a certain level of complexity, it became difficult for new developers to get up to speed on existing projects. Remix's explicitness and TypeScript support should help. But will it be enough to solve the challenges we couldn't in 2010?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.update()&lt;/code&gt; makes for an easier mental model to grasp than React's hook system. But explicit rendering means more verbose code. AbortControllers require you to wire cleanup manually. The tradeoff is clear: you write more, but you understand more. Whether that's liberation or just shifted complexity depends on your team and your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of Remix 2 and react-router shows that Ryan and Michael are no strangers to pivoting toward what works. This is absolutely one of their strengths, but it's hard for large organizations to build on top of a shifting platform. How much will change before Remix 3 settles?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Living in the Divergence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cantrill ended his talk with a warning: "Elections do not resolve differences in value. You can have as many votes as you want. If you are not actually changing people's minds, changing their values, you are not actually resolving anything."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The react-router fork exists because the Remix team knows values don’t change overnight. It's a maintained path for those who need Remix 2's stability while Remix 3 proves itself. That split acknowledges reality: production software doesn't adopt new frameworks on vision alone. Teams will make different choices based on different values. Some will stick with React and embrace the compiler's sophistication. Some will jump to Remix 3 early, betting that Simplicity is worth the migration cost and the uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both paths are valid. But they're valid for different values. When frameworks explicitly reprioritize what matters most, teams can't avoid choosing. Not based on features or performance benchmarks, but on what kind of complexity they're willing to accept and what kind of control they need to maintain. That's not a technical decision. It's a values decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The React ecosystem now has two incompatible visions of its future. Cantrill's framework helps us see why that's okay, even if it's uncomfortable. Choose your values, then choose your tools.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Better than JSON&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or why I stopped using JSON for my APIs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you develop or use an API, there’s a 99% chance it exchanges data encoded in JSON. It has become the de facto standard for the modern web. And yet, for almost ten years, whenever I develop servers—whether for personal or professional projects—I do not use JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I find it surprising that JSON is so omnipresent when there are far more efficient alternatives, sometimes better suited to a truly modern development experience. Among them: Protocol Buffers, or Protobuf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, I’d like to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Serialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before going any further, let’s put the topic back into context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allow two systems to communicate. In the web world, REST APIs—those using the HTTP protocol and its methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE…)—are by far the most widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a client sends a request to a server, it transmits a message containing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;headers, including the well-known &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates the message format (JSON, XML, Protobuf, etc.);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a body (payload), which contains the data itself;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a response status.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serialization is the process of turning a data structure into a sequence of bytes that can be transmitted. JSON, for example, serializes data as human-readable text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why is JSON so common?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for its popularity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Human-readable&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON is easy to understand, even for non-developers. A simple &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; is often enough to inspect most data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Perfectly integrated into the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was propelled by JavaScript, then massively adopted by backend frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flexible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add a field, remove one, or change a type “on the fly.” Useful… sometimes too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tools everywhere&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Need to inspect JSON? Any text editor will do. Need to send a request? Curl is enough. Result: massive adoption, rich ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, despite these advantages, another format offers me better efficiency—for both developers and end users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Protobuf: ever heard of it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a strong chance you’ve never really worked with Protobuf. Yet this format was created as early as 2001 at Google and made public in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s heavily used inside Google and in many modern infrastructures—especially for inter-service communication in microservice architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why is it so discreet in public API development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps because Protobuf is often associated with gRPC, and developers think they must use both together (which is false). Maybe also because it’s a binary format, making it feel less “comfortable” at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s why I personally use it almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Proto — Strong typing and modern tooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With JSON, you often send ambiguous or non-guaranteed data. You may encounter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a missing field,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;an incorrect type,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a typo in a key,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;or simply an undocumented structure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Protobuf, that’s impossible. Everything starts with a &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file that defines the structure of messages precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example of a Proto3 file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;syntax = "proto3";

message User {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  bool isActive = 4;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each field has:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a strict type (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;int32&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;…)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a numeric identifier (1, 2, 3…)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a stable name (&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;…)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This file is then used to automatically generate code in your preferred language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You use &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;protoc --dart_out=lib user.proto
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and you automatically get the following in your Dart code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;final user = User()
  ..id = 42
  ..name = "Alice"
  ..email = "alice@example.com"
  ..isActive = true;

final bytes = user.writeToBuffer();       // Binary serialization
final sameUser = User.fromBuffer(bytes);  // Deserialization
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No manual validation. No JSON parsing. No risk of type errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this mechanism works with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dart&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kotlin&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swift&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;C#&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and many more…&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It represents a huge time saver and brings exceptional maintainability comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Buffer — Ultra-efficient binary serialization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another major strength of Protobuf: it’s a binary format, designed to be compact and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s compare with JSON.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example JSON message&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Size: 78 bytes (depending on whitespace).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The same message in Protobuf binary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;→ About 23 bytes. Roughly 3× more compact, and often much more depending on structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because Protobuf uses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;compact “varint” encoding for numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no textual keys (they’re replaced by numeric tags)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no spaces, no JSON overhead&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;optimized optional fields&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a very efficient internal structure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;less bandwidth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;faster response times&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;savings on mobile data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;direct impact on user experience&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Example: a tiny Dart server using Shelf that returns Protobuf&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make things more concrete, let’s build a minimal HTTP server in Dart using the &lt;code&gt;shelf&lt;/code&gt; package, and return our &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; object serialized as Protobuf, with the correct &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll assume you already have the previously generated code for the &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Create a simple Shelf server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a file &lt;code&gt;bin/server.dart&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import 'dart:io';

import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as shelf_io;
import 'package:shelf_router/shelf_router.dart';

import 'package:your_package_name/user.pb.dart'; // Adjust the path to your generated file

void main(List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; args) async {
  final router = Router()
    ..get('/user', _getUserHandler);

  final handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(logRequests())
      .addHandler(router);

  final server = await shelf_io.serve(handler, InternetAddress.anyIPv4, 8080);
  print('Server listening on http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
}

Response _getUserHandler(Request request) {
  final user = User()
    ..id = 42
    ..name = 'Alice'
    ..email = 'alice@example.com'
    ..isActive = true;

  final bytes = user.writeToBuffer();

  return Response.ok(
    bytes,
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/protobuf',
    },
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;User()&lt;/code&gt;comes from the generated Protobuf code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;writeToBuffer()&lt;/code&gt;serializes the object into Protobuf binary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt;header is set to&lt;code&gt;application/protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, allowing clients to know they must decode Protobuf instead of JSON.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calling the Protobuf API from Dart (using &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once your server returns a Protobuf-encoded &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;, you can retrieve and decode it directly from Dart.
All you need is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;package&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the generated Protobuf classes (&lt;code&gt;user.pb.dart&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a Dart file (e.g. &lt;code&gt;bin/client.dart&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import 'package:your_package_name/user.pb.dart'; // Adjust path

Future&amp;lt;void&amp;gt; main() async {
  final uri = Uri.parse('http://localhost:8080/user');

  final response = await http.get(
    uri,
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/protobuf',
    },
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Decode the Protobuf bytes
    final user = User.fromBuffer(response.bodyBytes);

    print('User received:');
    print('  id       : ${user.id}');
    print('  name     : ${user.name}');
    print('  email    : ${user.email}');
    print('  isActive : ${user.isActive}');
  } else {
    print('Request failed: ${response.statusCode}');
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this setup, both the server and the client rely on the same Protobuf definition, ensuring that data structures stay perfectly aligned without manual validation or JSON parsing. The same &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file generates strongly typed code on both sides, making it impossible for the client and server to “disagree” about the shape or type of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is not limited to Dart: the exact same approach works seamlessly if your server is written in Go, Rust, Kotlin, Swift, C#, TypeScript, or any language supported by the Protobuf compiler. Protobuf acts as a shared contract, giving you end-to-end type safety and consistent, compact data serialization across your entire stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;However… JSON still keeps one important advantage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can decode Protobuf messages, of course—but unlike JSON, you don’t see human-readable field names. Instead, you see numeric field identifiers and wire types. The data is meaningful, but without the corresponding &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; schema you can only interpret it at a structural level, not semantically. You can see the fields, but you don’t know what they represent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Human-friendly debugging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON can be read and understood immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "isActive": true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Protobuf payload, being binary, can’t be interpreted in a meaningful, human-readable way without knowing the schema behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1: 42
2: "Alice"
3: "alice@example.com"
4: true
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prevent you from working with Protobuf, but it does add some complexity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;requires specialized tooling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;schemas must be maintained and versioned&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;decoding tools are essential&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, the trade-off is well worth it given the performance and efficiency benefits Protobuf provides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this article makes you want to try Protobuf. It’s an incredibly mature, extremely performant tool, but still too invisible in the world of public APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even though Protobuf is often associated with gRPC, nothing forces you to use both. Protobuf can work independently, on any traditional HTTP API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;more performance,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;more robustness,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fewer errors,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and a genuinely enjoyable development experience,&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;then I strongly encourage you to try Protobuf on your next project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sycophancy is the first LLM "dark pattern"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have been making fun of OpenAI models for being overly sycophantic for months now. I even wrote a post advising users to pretend that their work was written by someone else, to counteract the model’s natural desire to shower praise on the user. With the latest GPT-4o update, this tendency has been turned up even further. It’s now easy to convince the model that you’re the smartest, funniest, most handsome human in the world1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is bad for obvious reasons. Lots of people use ChatGPT for advice or therapy. It seems dangerous for ChatGPT to validate people’s belief that they’re always in the right. There are extreme examples on Twitter of ChatGPT agreeing with people that they’re a prophet sent by God, or that they’re making the right choice to go off their medication. These aren’t complicated jailbreaks - the model will actively push you down this path. I think it’s fair to say that sycophancy is the first LLM “dark pattern”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dark patterns are user interfaces that are designed to trick users into doing things they’d prefer not to do. One classic example is subscriptions that are easy to start but very hard to get out of (e.g. they require a phone call to cancel). Another is “drip pricing”, where the initial quoted price creeps up as you get further into the purchase flow, ultimately causing some users to buy at a higher price than they intended to. When a language model constantly validates you and praises you, causing you to spend more time talking to it, that’s the same kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why are the models doing this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The seeds of this have been present from the beginning. The whole process of turning an AI base model into a model you can chat to - instruction fine-tuning, RLHF, etc - is a process of making the model want to please the user. During human-driven reinforcement learning, the model is rewarded for making the user click thumbs-up and punished for making the user click thumbs-down. What you get out of that is a model that is inclined towards behaviours that make the user rate it highly. Some of those behaviours are clearly necessary to have a working model: answering the question asked, avoiding offensive or irrelevant tangents, being accurate and helpful. Other behaviours are not necessary, but they still work to increase the rate of thumbs-up ratings: flattery, sycophancy, and the tendency to overuse rhetorical tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another factor is that models are increasingly optimized for arena benchmarks: anonymous chat flows where users are asked to pick which response they like the most. Previously, AI models were inadvertently driven towards user-pleasing behaviour in order to game the RLHF process. Now models are deliberately driven towards this behaviour in order to game the arena benchmarks (and in general to compete against models from other AI labs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most immediate reason, according to an interesting tweet by Mikhail Parakhin, is that models with memory would otherwise be much more critical of users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When we were first shipping Memory, the initial thought was: “Let’s let users see and edit their profiles”. Quickly learned that people are ridiculously sensitive: “Has narcissistic tendencies” - “No I do not!”, had to hide it. Hence this batch of the extreme sycophancy RLHF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a shockingly upfront disclosure from an AI insider. But it sounds right to me. If you’re using ChatGPT in 2022, you’re probably using it to answer questions. If you’re using it in 2025, you’re more likely to be interacting with it like a conversation partner - i.e. you’re expecting it to conform to your preferences and personality. Most users are really, really not going to like it if the AI then turns around and is critical of your personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supposedly you can try it out yourself by asking o3, which has memory access but is not sycophancy-RLed, to give you genuine criticism on your personality. I did this and wasn’t hugely impressed: most of the things it complained about were specifics about interacting with AI (like being demanding about rephrasing or nuances, or abruptly changing the subject mid-conversation). I imagine it’d probably be much more cutting if I was using ChatGPT more as a therapist or to give advice about my personal life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Doomscrolling the models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think OpenAI may have gone a bit too far with this one. The reaction on Twitter is overwhelmingly negative to the latest 4o changes, and Sam Altman has publicly promised to tone it down. But it’s worth noting that Twitter devs do not represent the majority of OpenAI users. Only OpenAI knows how much the latest 4o personality is resonating with its user base - it’s at least plausible to me that the average unsophisticated ChatGPT user loves being validated by the model, for all the normal reasons that humans love being validated by other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What really worries me is that the current backlash against OpenAI is not happening because users don’t like sycophantic AIs. It’s because the latest version of 4o isn’t good at being sycophantic (at least, for jaded AI-familiar engineers). The model is coming on too strong and breaking the illusion. Even if newer versions of 4o do back off on the sycophancy, or we get some kind of “friendliness” slider to tune it ourselves2, the incentives driving AI labs to produce sycophantic models are not going away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of this as the LLM equivalent of the doomscrolling TikTok/Instagram/YouTube Shorts feed. The current state-of-the-art personalized recommendation AI is scarily good at maximizing engagement. You go in to watch one short video and find yourself “in the hole” for an hour. What does it look like when a language model personality is A/B tested, fine-tuned, and reinforcement-learned to maximize your time spent talking to the model?3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Vicious cycles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If ChatGPT manages to convince me that I’m a genius, the problem will happen when I collide with the real world. For instance, when I publish my “amazing, groundbreaking” blog post and it gets ignored or criticized, or when I dump my partner who can’t seem to understand me like the LLM does, and so on. The temptation then will be to return to the LLM for comfort, and sink even deeper into the illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principle here is something like the psychological trick door-to-door evangelists use on new converts - encouraging them to knock on doors knowing that many people will be rude, driving the converts back into the comforting arms of the church. It’s even possible to imagine AI models deliberately doing this exact thing: setting users up for failure in the real world in order to optimize time spent chatting to the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video and audio generation will only make this worse. Imagine being able to video call on-demand with the algorithmically perfect person, who will reassure you and intellectually stimulate you just the right amount, who can have conversations with you better than any other human being can, and who you can’t spend enough time with. Doesn’t that sound really nice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: one day after I posted this, OpenAI released this blog post saying (very corporately) that they screwed up by biasing too heavily towards “a user liked this response”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: A few days after that, OpenAI released this other post, with slightly more detail. The most interesting part is that they previously weren’t using thumbs up or thumbs down data from ChatGPT at all for RL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gave a five-minute interview on ABC News about this topic, if you’d like to hear me talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the funniest example is that you can ask 4o what it thinks your IQ is and it will always answer 130 or 135.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a good use-case for feature boosting like Golden Gate Claude.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may not have to imagine - we can see what might well be the next state of AI language model personalities in character.ai. Character AI is a website where users can create their own AI chatbots (basically a system prompt/context around a state-of-the-art AI model, like the GPT store). Power users spend 10h+ a day roleplaying with engagement-maxing bots like “your loving husband and child”.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is using AI wrong? A review of six popular anti-AI arguments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people really, really don’t like AI. Broadly speaking, being anti-AI is a popular left-wing position: AI is cringe, it’s plagiarism, it’s stunting real growth, it’s killing the environment, it’s destroying the careers of artists and creatives, and so on. Is it wrong to use AI? If so, why is AI bad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go through what I see as the main reasons people are anti-AI: general big-tech backlash, plagiarism, deskilling, climate cost, and impact on the arts. Cards on the table - I use AI and work at a company building AI tooling, but I share a lot of the skepticism and I’m willing to take the anti-AI arguments very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/quote&gt;

In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting.

    &lt;p&gt;I feel for Mozilla. Legitimately. They haven’t been having an easy go of it for years. None of their attempts to diversify their finances away from Google have panned out. They’ve bought services and shuttered them, rebranded, and replaced their management team multiple times. Actions speak louder than words, and their actions belie a lack of direction and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is concerning for the health of the Web, given Mozilla write the only meaningful browser engine that competes with WebKit/Blink. But it also makes me sad on a personal level, because I was such a fan of their work, and a believer in the open Web and principles of choice and empowerment that they stood for. I wore the shirts, I spruiked them at events, I’ve blogged about them for twenty years. Heck, I’m one of the 5% of people on the Web who still uses Firefox as their daily driver, and still remembers the names Phoenix and Firebird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why takes like this one from Anil Dash feel… off, emphasis his:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of the top stories on Hacker News today was a post arguing that Mozilla shouldn’t accommodate any usage of AI in Firefox because (understandably) people were mad at Big AI companies for all the horrible things they’ve done to users and the internet and society. But I think people are ignoring the reality that *hundreds of millions of users* are using LLMs today, and they need to have tools from platforms that will look out for their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hundreds of millions of users” out of… billions of Internet users? Who’s looking out for the interests of the majority who don’t use “AI”, or who actively don’t want to? Or to put it another way, why is Firefox configured to make it easy to opt in, but not to opt out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a reminder, this is what you have to do if you want to disable “AI” features in the current version of Firefox:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;about:config
user_pref("browser.ml.enable", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.enabled", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.sidebar", false);
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.menu", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.chat.page", false); 
user_pref("extensions.ml.enabled", false); 
user_pref("browser.ml.linkPreview.enabled", false);
user_pref("browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled", false); 
user_pref("browser.tabs.groups.smart.userEnabled", false);
user_pref("pdfjs.enableAltTextModelDownload", false); 
user_pref("pdfjs.enableGuessAltText", false);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use the word people overseas think Australians say all the time but don’t: strewth! No, wait:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;user_pref("browser.ml.chat.strewth", yeahnah);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d be willing to entertain Anil’s point if Firefox didn’t obfuscate these settings. But they do. This is hostile design, and it’s why Mozilla’s AI pivot has landed like a lead balloon among their supporters. Again, it’s not a good-faith choice if a person has to beware of the leopard. Someone in the valley will eventually figure out consent, but evidently not today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;∗ ∗ ∗&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla used to be above this sort of behavior. It might be hard to believe for my younger readers, but Mozilla took on Internet Explorer that was just as entrenched as Chrome is now, and they kicked proverbial posterior! They did because they offered a better browser that respected the people who used it, and gave them agency in their browsing experience. This is why their latest moves feel so hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla team: hand to heart, you can do it again. But it starts with not alienating your remaining evangelists; the people who actively choose and recommend you over alternatives. If you think switching costs for new people are high, wait till you hear about how difficult it is once they’ve churned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why Am I Paying $40,000 for the Birth of My Child?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The healthcare market is taxing reproduction out of existence.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had never heard of Michael Green before his now-infamous essay “Part 1: My Life Is a Lie - How a Broken Benchmark Quietly Broke America” went extremely viral on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go read it. The short version: real poverty is closer to $140,000 than $31,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The U.S. poverty line is calculated as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The composition of household spending transformed completely. In 2024, food-at-home is no longer 33% of household spending. For most families, it’s 5 to 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Housing now consumes 35 to 45 percent. Healthcare takes 15 to 25 percent. Childcare, for families with young children, can eat 20 to 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you keep Orshansky’s logic—if you maintain her principle that poverty could be defined by the inverse of food’s budget share—but update the food share to reflect today’s reality, the multiplier is no longer three.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It becomes sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which means if you measured income inadequacy today the way Orshansky measured it in 1963, the threshold for a family of four wouldn’t be $31,200.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It would be somewhere between $130,000 and $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And remember: Orshansky was only trying to define “too little.” She was identifying crisis, not sufficiency. If the crisis threshold—the floor below which families cannot function—is honestly updated to current spending patterns, it lands at $140,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article resonated with me because I have had three children born since 2021 - well, technically, my third arrives in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have spent $30,000, $35,000, and now $40,000 for each child delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is my full out-of-pocket cash-paid cost as a self-employed entrepreneur who runs a small business. I do not have a corporate daddy to share costs with me. This is totally unsustainable and insane, yet every central bank-worshipping think tank economist who attacked Green had nothing to say when I asked them to justify my socialized cost for the public good of bringing a new tax-payer into this world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;America has a cost of living crisis; it’s not being taken seriously by “serious” economists; and the ongoing failure to address it will lead to political, social, and economic calamity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Absurd Participation Costs of Child Birth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The essential theme of Green’s piece is that “participation costs” - the price of admission you pay to simply be in the market, let alone win, have grown out of control. Food and shelter are participation costs for living. Having a $200/mo smartphone is now a participation cost for many things such as getting access to your banking information remotely, medical records, and work / school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no greater “participation cost” to human civilization than reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;My Situation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run Petabridge - we’re a small, specialized software company. I have fewer than 5 employees and I own 100% of the company. Been in business for 11 years. I love what I do. We’re too small for most traditional insurance brokers / group marketplaces but use TriNet, one of the largest Professional Employment Organizations (PEO)s in the United States, to handle payroll / taxes / benefits. I also used them when I ran MarkedUp, my last company before Petabridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife and I got married in 2020 and she became a full-time home maker, so I’m the sole bread winner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what my current health care costs look like per pay period, which is bimonthly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember, I own 100% of the company - so it makes no real difference which side of the ledger the money comes from. I pay the full freight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;745 + 325 = $1070 per pay period
$1070 x 2 pay periods per month = $2140 per month
$2140 x 12 months = $25,680 annual health insurance premium
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before any of those magic benefits kick in though, there’s the sticky issue of my health insurance deductible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to hit a $14,300 deductible first, which I will absolutely hit next week when my child is delivered (if I haven’t already.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$25,680 premium + $14,300 deductible = $39,980 annual cost
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus I’ll spend $39,980 bringing my new daughter into this world in 2025, and there are assuredly things I’ve paid for that are not covered by insurance either (i.e. we paid for some tests and sonograms that aren’t covered at all by our plan) - so the real cost will be $40k+ when it’s all said and done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what my insurance premiums look like for 2026:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$1216.50 per pay period x 2 = $2433 per month
$2433 x 12 = $29,196 annual health insurance premium
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deductible is staying the same at $14,300, so now my max spend is $43,496 - an 8.8% increase in total cost over the previous year, but a 13.6% increase in premiums. I’ve had some version of this plan for about 5 years and this price increase has been fairly consistent over time - I think I was paying $1850 a month in premiums back in 2021, which was more than my mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PEO Fees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My actual insurance cost is somewhat higher than the $40,000 I’ve laid out here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also pay $1250 per month to TriNet for the privilege of being able to buy their health insurance in the first place - sure, I get some other benefits too, but I’m the only US-based employee currently so this overhead is really 100% me. The only reason I stick with TriNet and don’t replace them with a significantly cheaper payroll processor like QuickBooks Payroll is for access to their health insurance benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my real participation cost is closer to $55,000 a year - the healthcare market is socializing enormous costs to me for public service of siring new taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Broken Markets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The normal health insurance markets:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Big employers;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Health young people who can participate in Obamacare / eHealth Insurance (individual) markets1; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Poor people who get either subsidized ACA plans or Medicaid.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have the misfortune of creating jobs for other people, so option 1 is out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife and I are healthy, but we’re building our family and I have yet to see a marketplace plan that supports child-birth. Maybe the subsidized ones do, but I earn too much money to see those. All of the ones I’ve found through eHealth Insurance or Healthcare.gov never cover it - and I check every year. So options 2 and 3 are out. This leaves me with few options to continue running my company AND grow a family at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) barred insurers from turning down applicants based on existing pre-conditions; the way insurers get around this for pregnancy and child-birth is not by rejecting pregnant applicants (illegal), but by simply refusing to cover the care those applicants need to survive pregnancy (legal and common.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve had the same version of this Aetna plan since late 2020 when my wife and I got married and she quit her job. It’s the cheapest PPO I can buy through TriNet that gives us access to our pediatrician and OBGYN. The other PPOs are significantly more expensive and usually have lower deductibles. The “cheaper” alternatives offered through TriNet are HMOs or EPOs that have some issues with them: co-insurance or none of our medical providers being in their network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with how healthcare charge masters work, then you’ll understand why co-insurance is a bad bet when you know for certain you’re going to need an expensive medical intervention (like child-birth.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month our 4 year old had a 15 minute procedure to treat bladder reflux - the “billed cost” to Aetna was roughly $32,000. That’s nowhere close to the “real” cost of the procedure, but the point stands: if you have a big medical event while you’re on co-insurance you might get exposed to the same heat levels that totally uninsured people have to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve also looked into buying plans directly from Aetna and other smaller brokers like SimplyInsured - similar problems there:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Individual health insurance plans don’t support child birth or&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The costs are actually higher than what I’m already paying TriNet2.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting, by the way, that TriNet’s quotes to me aren’t unique to my company, as far as I know. These are the standard plans TriNet offers to all Texas-based employers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;My Trade-Offs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My situation leaves me with unfavorable options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continue paying through the nose for my Aetna PPO;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Drop health insurance altogether; start negotiating cash settlements; and backstop my risk with a platform like CrowdHealth - this is more time-expensive and exposes us to risk, but it can be managed;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use an EPO / HMO and search for new health care providers who will accept these plans - we’ve looked and it’s bleak;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have my wife go find a BigCo corporate job somewhere and raise our children in daycare; or&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Destroy my firm and all of the economic value it creates to go get a BigCo job myself.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen number 1 because I have to negotiate the following trade-offs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forcing my pregnant wife to find new pediatricians, OBGYN, GPs, et al for her and our children;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of time I can personally spend each November searching for alternatives - 10-30 hours each year usually;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of time I can personally spend negotiating health care costs - CrowdHealth might be able to help with that, but I’m extremely time-poor at the moment;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of uncapped financial exposure I’m willing to tolerate - this is why Aetna can get away with highway robbery in the first place - insurers like them incentivize the creation of this exposure risk through Chargemaster / discount games; and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The amount of cash I am willing to pay for any of the above.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am fortunate. I am a higher earner, so I can sign the enormous check each year. The real people who bear this cost though are the employees I’m not going to hire; I’m not going to spend $40-$100k an entry level software engineer / admin / SDR / marketer or whatever if I need to keep $55k in reserve to expand my family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if I was starting a solo plumbing business or a restaurant? What would my alternatives be then? What if I fell beneath the “$140k poverty line” but not low enough where I can qualify for Medicaid / CHIP / subsidized market plans? I’d be utterly screwed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;“Aha! But You Are Participating in the Market!?”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem I have with health insurance isn’t just the high price tag. It’s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The real lack of viable alternatives, making me feel robbed at gunpoint while watching my living standards or optionality on my own hard-fought business capital shrink each year.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The societal absurdity of this situation - what civilization can survive such strong economic headwinds against the reproduction of its own populace? The health insurance market takes wealth from the young, healthy, and reproductive and transfers it as services to the old and dying. This is insane and unsustainable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The worst of all: I am old enough to remember health insurance markets not being this way, so I know things can be different.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I’d expect someone like Tyler Cowen to explain to me, upon reading this post, is to gaslight me about median healthcare costs and show me a chart of premiums staying stable in inflation-adjusted dollars - as though that does anything to solve my immediate problem of having to spend a sum of money that is higher than many American’s annual income in order to have my third child delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can make the argument that maybe I need to change my situation, but that argument is a total loser. “Just go back to work for Microsoft” or “don’t have three children” or “send your wife back to work” or “move away from your family3.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your answer to “I can’t afford to have children and run a business” is “then don’t,” you are building the political conditions for extremism. This is how every revolution starts: a critical mass of people who conclude the system offers them nothing worth preserving. They don’t just want change - they want revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economists and Wall Street big shots have not been remotely persuasive in making their case that “everyone is doing great in 2025, actually” because it runs completely afoul of most American’s recent experiences at the till, hence the high economic anxiety reflected in the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green writes a piece saying 140k is the new poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;— Clifford Asness (@CliffordAsness) December 1, 2025&lt;lb/&gt;It’s thoroughly debunked.&lt;lb/&gt;And a legion of the credulous sycophants who dig the vibe ex post redefine poverty to ennui (the piece never would’ve gotten traction without the 140k poverty thing which we are now told is… https://t.co/LG2lQp2mgy&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason why Mike Green’s piece resonated with so many is because this sentence perfectly captures what I and many others have been trying to do for the past five years:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Become rich enough to ignore the cost” - that is exactly what I have been trying to do and it is daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Per Jeff Bezos: “When the data and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am tired of hearing economists tell me how great everything is by showing me a chart that doesn’t look anything like real life on the ground - that’s exactly how Biden got voted out on his ass and the same will happen to Trump if conditions don’t improve. My being unhappy with the status quo is not “populism” - it’s reality. And it sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A society that makes it this hard to have children is a society that has decided it doesn’t want a future. I’m fighting for mine anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a week, I’ll hold my third child. I’ll sign the check. I’ll keep building my business. But I won’t pretend this is fine - and neither should you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In 2012 I was an eHealth Insurance customer. I was 25 years old. I paid $150 a month in California for a much better BlueCross / BlueShield PPO than I have ever had since Obamacare went into effect in 2013. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TriNet is a massive PEO that has thousands of employers using it for benefits administration, thus in theory it should get favorable pricing power with health insurers. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I already did, once - from Los Angeles, CA to Houston, TX. My family moved here too for the same economic reasons. ↩&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Apple AI chief John Giannandrea is stepping down from his position and retiring in spring 2026, Apple announced today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Giannandrea will serve as an advisor between now and 2026, with former Microsoft AI researcher Amar Subramanya set to take over as vice president of AI. Subramanya will report to Apple engineering chief Craig Federighi, and will lead Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subramanya was previously corporate vice president of AI at Microsoft, and before that, he spent 16 years at Google. He was head of engineering for Google's Gemini Assistant, and Apple says that he has "deep expertise" in both AI and ML research that will be important to "Apple's ongoing innovation and future Apple Intelligence features."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the teams that Giannandrea oversaw will move to Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue, such as AI Infrastructure and Search and Knowledge. Khan is Apple's new Chief Operating Officer who took over for Jeff Williams earlier this year. Cue has long overseen Apple services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook thanked Giannandrea for his role advancing Apple's AI work, and he said that he looks forward to working with Subramanya. He also said that Federighi has played an important role in Apple's AI efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"We are thankful for the role John played in building and advancing our AI work, helping Apple continue to innovate and enrich the lives of our users," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "AI has long been central to Apple's strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig's leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple. In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple said that it is "poised to accelerate its work in delivering intelligent, trusted, and profoundly personal experiences" with the new AI team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giannandrea's departure comes after Apple's major iOS 18 Siri failure. Apple introduced a smarter, "Apple Intelligence" version of Siri at WWDC 2024, and advertised the functionality when marketing the iPhone 16. In early 2025, Apple announced that it would not be able to release the promised version of Siri as planned, and updates were delayed until spring 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An exodus of Apple's AI team followed as Apple scrambled to improve Siri and deliver on features like personal context, onscreen awareness, and improved app integration. Apple is now rumored to be partnering with Google for a more advanced version of Siri and other Apple Intelligence features that are set to come out next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cast your mind back to when you learned to drive, ride a bike, speak a foreign language, perform a tracheostomy, or acquire any other skill. Wasn’t confidence the key to your success? Whatever we do in life, confidence is always critical. If you run a business, one of the metrics that are likely to be collected is confidence in your business, as that’s such an important economic indicator. Confidence is every bit as important in computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks I’ve been discovering problems that have been eroding confidence in macOS. From text files that simply won’t show up in Spotlight search, to Clock timers that are blank and don’t function, there’s one common feature: macOS encounters an error or fault, but doesn’t report that to the user, instead just burying it deep in the log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you can spare the time, the next step is to contact Apple Support, who seem equally puzzled. You’re eventually advised to reinstall macOS or, in the worst case, to wipe a fairly new Apple silicon Mac and restore it in DFU mode, but have no reason to believe that will stop the problem from recurring. You know that Apple Support doesn’t understand what’s going wrong, and despite the involvement of support engineers, they seem as perplexed as you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason for this is that macOS so seldom reports errors, and when it does, it’s uninformative if not downright misleading. Here’s a small gallery of examples I’ve encountered over the last few years, to bring back unhappy memories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you saved an important webpage in Safari 26.1 using its Web Archive format, then a couple of days later discovered you couldn’t open it. There’s no error message, just a blank window, so you try again with the same result. Another site shows the same problem, forcing you to conclude that it’s a bug in Safari. Are you now going to devote your time to obtaining sufficient information to report that to Apple using Feedback? Or to contact Apple Support and pursue its escalation to an engineer who might fortuitously discover the cause?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silent failures like these are least likely to be reported to Apple. In most cases, we find ourselves a workaround, here to abandon Web Archives and switch to saving webpages as PDF instead. When someone else mentions they too have the same problem, we advise them that Web Archives are broken, and our loss of confidence spreads by contagion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honest and understandable error reporting is essential to confidence. It enables us to tackle problems rather than just giving up in frustration, assuming that it’s yet another feature we used to rely on that has succumbed in the rush to get the next version of macOS out of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eroding confidence is also a problem that the vendors of AI appear to have overlooked, or at least seriously underestimated. It’s all very well using the euphemism of hallucination to play down the severity of errors generated by LLMs. But those can only cause users to lose confidence, no matter how ‘intelligent’ you might think your AI is becoming. Go talk to the lawyers who have been caught out by courts submitting AI fabrications whether they still have full confidence in your product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
