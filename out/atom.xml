  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That seemed solvable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- 6 results published, 4 in progress&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On https://laboratory.love/faq you say: "We never accept funding from companies whose products we might test. All our funding comes from individual contributors." On https://laboratory.love/blog you say: "If you're a product manufacturer interested in having your product tested, we welcome your participation in funding."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have zero stake in this, but I read it as they won’t accept blank checks from those companies, but if those companies want to pay for testing they can work something out. It’s poorly worded but I don’t think they are trying to be sneaky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I certainly want to avoid any weird incentive misalignment. Because the testing is done by an accredited lab that provides an official Certificate of Analysis, I think I could reasonably accept funding from manufacturers once I build out a feature that would will allow visitors to download the COA PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No manufacturer has reached out directly yet, presumably because a) this project is small and still gaining trust and b) they would probably want to do testing privately and avoid publication of 'bad' results anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is really cool and I was hoping something similar existed earlier this year when looking into protein powders following the Clean Label Transparency Project report [1]. Basically they said about half of protein powders tested showed signs of heavy metals, but did not disclose which brands. I would be interested in funding testing for some specific brands as I am sure others would as well. I did a bit of digging on a few brands and found lawsuits against them for violating prop 65, sometimes multiple [2][3] from the same brand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some testing has been done on https://labdoor.com/ where they basically fund the testing with affiliate links, which I think could be another revenue source for your site. I did contact them in January and they said they would add the brands I requested to the list, it's just not crowdsourced the same way your site is. They received some form of backing from Mark Cuban [4].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(edit) To make this more clear - If you are looking for expansion or making it a little wider, allowing users to request other types of testing besides the plastics would be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. An example result is "https://laboratory.love/product/117", which is a list of chemicals and measurements. Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations? What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly "best"? Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Is 3 tests enough? On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples. Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit? Could the labs be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. I'm still working to make results more digestible and actionable. This will include the %TDI toggle (total daily intake, for child vs adult and USA vs EU) as seen on PlasticList, but I'm also tinkering with an even more consumer-friendly 'chemical report card'. The final results page would have both the card and the detailed table of results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. I have not found any regulation-violating levels yet, so in some sense, I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Part of the issue here is that many believe the FDA levels are far too relaxed which is part of why demand for a service like laboratory.love exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. This is part of the challenge that PlasticList faced, and additionally a lot of my thinking around the chemical report card are related to this. Some folks think a single test would be sufficient to catch major red flags. I think triplicate testing is a reasonable balance of statistically robust while not being completely cost-prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Yes, I suppose one could do that, as long as the funded products can be acquired by laboratory.love anonymously through their normal consumer supply chains. Laboratory.love merely acquires three separate batches of a given product from different sources, tests them at an ISO/IEC 17025-accredited lab, and publishes the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. I suppose any project can be shut down by a lawsuit, but laboratory.love is not currently breaking any laws as far as I'm aware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK levels are more strict and generally more up to date, which I personally follow rather than FDA. Could be nice to show those violations as a comparison to FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is something I'm struggling with as a user. I look at a product (this tofu for example [0]) and see the amounts. And then I have absolutely no clue what it means. Is it bad? How bad? I see nanograms one place and μg in an info menu - is μg a nanogram? And what is LOQ? Virtually 0? Simply less than the recommended amount?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think 99% of people will have the same reaction. They will have no idea what the information means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I clicked on some info icons to try and get more context. The context is good (explains what the different categories are) but it still didnt help me understand the amounts. I went to "About" and it didnt help with this. I went to the FAQ and and the closest I can find is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;What makes a result 'concerning'? We don't make safety judgments. Instead, we compare results to established regulatory limits from FDA, EPA, and EFSA, noting when products exceed these thresholds. We also flag when regulatory limits themselves may be outdated based on new research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I understand that you don't want to make the judgement and it's about transparency and getting the information. But the information is worthless if people dont know what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to see the results of the test compared to the EU/US/Whoever recommendations. I want explanations of what the different chemicals are and preferably linked to peer reviewed studies explaining side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once even more tests are ran I want comparisons between product brands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall still great but very much an engineer presentation to complex data. Not that its a bad thing, being transparent with data is important, but we aren't all experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks, and yes these improvements are on my roadmap!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working to make results more digestible and actionable.

    &lt;p&gt;This is great, but I wouldn't consider a food to be "clean" just from this testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a minimum it needs glyphosate testing. I suspect the avocado oil has no plastics but high glyphosate, it's one of the many reasons I only use high-quality olive oil and coconut oil in cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What bugs me is that plastics manufacturers advertise "BPA-free", which is technically correct, but then add a very similar chemical from the same family that has the same effect on the plastic - which is good - but also has the same effect on your endocrine system&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll add subscriptions as a more formal option on laboratory.love soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I don't think I can have a 365-day refund with a recurring donations like this. The financial infrastructure would add too much complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serious question: around 1900 meat was often preserved using formaldehyde, and milk was adulterated with water and chalk, and sometimes with pureed calf brains to simulate cream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope we can agree that we are better off than that now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I'm curious about is whether you think it's been a steady stream of improvements, and we just need to improve further? Or if you think there was some point between 1900 and now where food health and safety was maximized, greater than either 1900 or now, and we've regressed since then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to collapse high dimensional, complex phenomena onto a single axis usually gives one a fake sense of certainty. One should avoid it as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet we report gun deaths per year, smoking rates, sea warming, etc. etc. The error isn't in producing or considering an aggregate result, but in ignoring where it came from. Since this is an internet forum and not a policy think tank I think that error is largely moot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or put another way: it was a simple question that the ggp can answer or not as they choose. I was just curious for their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My instinct is that things have largely gotten better over time. At a super-macro level, in 1900 we had directly adulterated food that e.g. the soldiers receiving Chicago meat called "embalmed". In the mid-20th century we had waterways that caught fire and leaded gas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the late 20th we had clean(er) air (this is all from a U.S. perspective) and largely safe food. I think if we were to claim a regression, the high point would have to be around 2000, but I can't point to anything specific going on now that wasn't also going on then -- e.g. I think microplastics were a thing then as well, we just weren't paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where are you? This project is not necessarily limited to products that are available in the United States. Anything that can be shipped to the United States is still testable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the current reach of the project (read: still small!), I suspect for awhile yet the majority of successfully funded testing will be by concerned individuals with expendable income. It is cheaper and much faster to go through laboratory.love than it would be to partner with a lab as an individual (plus the added bonus that all data is published openly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've yet to have any product funded by a manufacturer. I'm open to this, but I would only publish data for products that were acquired through normal consumer supply chains anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this looks so cool! I wish it told me if the levels found for tested products were good/bad - I have no prior reference so the numbers meant nothing to me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of them do measurements and YouTube videos. Neither one has a particularly good index of their completed reviews, let alone tools to compare the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish I could subscribe to support a domain like “loud speaker spin tests” and then have my donation paid out to these reviewers based on them publishing new high quality reviews with good data that is published to a common store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately $30 of culture media can produce &amp;gt;10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a bio hobbyist, this is fantastic! I don't do enough volume of PCR to think of it as expensive, but your use case of high-volume/automatic sounds fantastic! (And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some things that would be cool&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc. - Cheaper enzymes in general - More options for -80 freezers - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up. - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations. - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols. - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've thought a lot about this! My main goal is to create a cloud lab that doesn't suck - ie, a remote lab that is actually useful for people, and a lot of these are relevant things. Let me run down the ideas I have for each&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. You can purchase gel boxes that do 48 to 96 lanes at once. I'd ideally have it on a robot whose only purpose is to load and run these once or twice a day. All the samples coming through get batched together and run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Bioanalyzer seems nice for quantification of like PCRs to make sure you're getting the right size. But if I'll be honest I haven't though that much about it. But qPCRs actually become very cheap, if you can keep the machines full. You can also use something like a nanodrop and it is much much cheaper&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Pichia pastoris expression ^&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. You can use a plate reader (another thing that goes bulk nicely), but the reagents you can't really get around (but cheaper in bulk from China)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. If you aggregate, these become really cheap. The complicated bits are getting the proper cytomat parts for shaking, as they are limited on the used market&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. These can't be automated well, so I honestly haven't thought too much about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. Reagents cheaper in bulk China&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8. ehhhh, maybe? But not really. But if you think about a scaled centralized system, you can get away with not using oligos for a lot of things&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sounds really cool. I wouldn't agree you can't make money off this, you can make money off anything, just find people who need this and it seems you did find it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyhow good luck. Would love to follow if you do anything with this in the future. Do you have a blog or anything?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I saw a tweet from @awilkinson: “I just found out how much we pay for DocuSign and my jaw dropped. What's the best alternative?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Me being naive, I thought “how hard could would it actually be to build a free e-sign tool?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out not that hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In about a weekend, I built a UETA and ESIGN compliant tool. And it was free. And it cost me less than $50. Unlimited free e-sign. https://useinkless.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because when you send a document for a $75MM contract to be signed you want to send it via a well known and trusted document signing platform like Docusign where you know everything is legit and legally defensible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised how much trust people place in legal departments, balance sheet strength and talent capacity. All things for which I had to turn down superior technical proposals in the past. The old saying „Nobody gets fired for buying IBM“ still runs strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free e-signatures are a great idea, have you considered getting a foundation to back the project and maybe taking out some indemnity insurance, perhaps raising a dispute fund?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Couldn’t agree more, trust is the currency in enterprise SaaS. At Flowmono Sign, https://www.flowmono.com/en-US/ we’ve seen how adding layers like audit trails, compliance verification, and insured uptime completely changes how legal and procurement teams engage with e-sign tools. Free is great, but trusted and simple is what keeps adoption steady.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://penneo.com/ is a good alternative. And while I applaud your effort to do something in this space, personally I'd prefer a solution that's been thought over by lawyers, etc. Faster is not better in this particular space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really neat build, always great seeing founders scratch their own itch. At Flowmono Sign, https://www.flowmono.com/en-US/ we’re tackling the same pain point but focused on helping scaling teams automate signing, approvals, and compliance in one flow. Love seeing this kind of innovation in the space!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a 3D voxel-based game engine for like 10 years in my spare time. The most recent big job has been to port the world gen and editor to the GPU, which has had some pretty cute knock-on effects. The most interesting is you can hot-reload the world gen shaders and out pop your changes on the screen, like a voxel version of shadertoy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also wrote a metaprogramming language which generates a lot of the editor UI for the engine. It's a bespoke C parser that supports a small subset of C++, which is exposed to the user through a 'scripting-like' language you embed directly in your source files. I wrote it as a replacement for C++ templates and in my completely unbiased opinion it is WAY better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple comment, but wow I really like the look of Bonsai! The lighting, shading and shapes are really beautiful, I think a game made in this would feel really unique&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A project to implement 1000 algorithms. I have finished around 400 so far and I am now focusing on adding test cases, writing implementations in Python and C, and creating formal proofs in Lean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been a fun way to dive deeper into how algorithms work and to see the differences between practical coding and formal reasoning. The long-term goal is to make it a solid reference and learning resource that covers correctness, performance, and theory in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project is still in its draft phase and will be heavily edited over the next few months and years as it grows and improves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone has thoughts on how to structure the proofs or improve the testing setup, I would love to hear ideas or feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, that looks fun and probably get to learn a lot about algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have any feedback, but rather a question, as I've seen many repositories with people sharing their algorithms, at least on GitHub for many different languages (e.g. https://github.com/TheAlgorithms), what did you find that was missing from those repositories that you wanted to write a book and implement hundreds of algorithms, what did you find that was lacking?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another reason for writing the book is that many developers see "algorithms" as something only needed for FAANG interviews, not for real work. For beginners and even seniors, learning algorithms often just means doing LeetCode problems, which most people dislike but feel forced to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to change that view and show that algorithms are beautiful and useful beyond interviews. They appear everywhere, from compilers to databases to the Linux kernel, where I found many interesting data structures worth exploring. (i will share more about this topic later)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to share more of these insights and connect with others who enjoy discussing real world algorithm design, which is what I love most about the Hacker News community (except for the occasional trolls that show up from time to time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those algorithms implement so random to me, with lack of explanation, no test cases, no formal proof, and often inconsistent naming or structure across languages. Many repositories like TheAlgorithms are great collections, but they feel more like code dumps than true learning resources. You can find an implementation of Dijkstra or QuickSort, but often there is no context: why it works, how to prove it correct, what the complexity is, or how to test it against edge cases. For someone who wants to learn algorithms deeply, that missing layer of reasoning and validation is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No organization for learners either. It jumps straight into implementations without a logical flow from fundamentals. I want to build something more structured: start from the very foundation (like data structures, recursion, and complexity analysis), then move to classical algorithms (search, sort, graph, dynamic programming), and eventually extend to database internals, optimization, and even machine learning or AI algorithms. Basically, a single consistent roadmap from beginner to researcher level, where every algorithm connects to the next and builds intuition step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another very good resource for beginners is https://www.hello-algo.com. At first, i actually wanted to contribute there, since it explains algorithms visually and in simple language. But it mostly covers the basics and stops before more advanced or applied topics. I want to go deeper and treat algorithms as both code and theory, with mathematical rigor and formal proofs where possible. That is something I really liked about Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and of course The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) by Knuth. They combine reasoning, math, and practice. My goal is to make something in that spirit, but more practical and modern, bridging the gap between academic books and messy open source repos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more context, I actually used The Algorithms as a reference when working on my own programming language, Mochi, which includes around 150–300 algorithms (I don't remember exactly) implemented directly in Mochi. These are then transpiled to over 25 programming languages such as C, Haskell, Java, Go, Scala, and more: https://github.com/mochilang/mochi/tree/main/tests/algorithm...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VM and transpiler were originally implemented by hand, and later I used Codex to help polish the code. The generated output works, though it is a bit messy in places. Hopefully, after finishing a few books, I can return to the project with more experience and add better use cases for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great idea. I had been thinking about pretty much the same but perhaps targeted at executives and perhaps including AI/Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I usually feel to many people wildly through around terms they hardly understand, in the belief they cannot possibly understand. That’s so wrong, every executive should understand some of what determines button line. It’s not like people skip economics because it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love to perhaps contribute sometime next year. Stared and until then good luck - perhaps add a donation link!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! I completely agree. For more than ten years consulting, training and architecting systems for clients across government and enterprise, I have seen the same pattern. Long before "big data", "cloud" and now with "AI" and "GenAI" these buzzwords have often been misunderstood by most of the C-suite. In my entire career, explaining the basics and setting the right expectations has always been the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really like your idea of targeting executives and connecting it to real business outcomes. Getting decision makers to truly understand the fundamentals behind the technology would make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope the next generation learns to love "C" and Algorithms again. I have rediscovered my appreciation for C recently, even though Go is my main professional programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like the presentation of Lomuto's algorithm on p.110 would be improved by moving the i++ after the swap and making the corresponding adjustments to the accesses to i outside the loop. Also mentioning that it's Lomuto's algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These comments are probably too broad in scope to be useful this late in the project, so consider them a note to myself. C as the language for presenting the algorithms has the advantage of wide availability, not sweeping performance-relevant issues like GC under the rug, and stability, but it ends up making the implementations overly monomorphic. And some data visualizations as in Sedgewick's book would also be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest inspiration for this project, though, is The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP), that level of depth and precision is the ultimate goal. I'm also planning to include formal proofs of all algorithms in Lean, though that could easily turn into a 10-year project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python probably is not suitable for any project that you want to retain value for 10 years or more; the community has a policy against maintaining backward compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I will stick with C. Recently, when I updated my very old knowledge, I noticed that C23 is actually pretty nice. It adds proper Unicode support, typeof and constexpr style keywords, improved atomics, and even better support for inline functions and generics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is also why in TAOCP, Don Knuth used MIX (and later MMIX) to keep the book language agnostic and timeless. Before Knuth's birthday next year, I am hoping to finish most of the exercises in TAOCP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sedgewick's Algorithms book is great for practical learning but too tied to Java and implementation details. It is a bit shallow on theory, though the community and resources for other languages help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I personally prefer Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) for its formal rigor and clear proofs, and Grokking Algorithms for building intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The broader goal of this project is to build a well tested, reference quality set of implementations in C, Python, and Go. That is the next milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was the very first edition of Sedgewick's Algorithms written in Pascal? I heard that but never actually saw that version myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your comment brought back an old memory for me. My first programming language in high school was Turbo Pascal. That IDE was amazing: instant compilation, the blue screen TUI, F1 for inline help, a surprisingly good debugger, and it just felt so smooth and fast back then. No internet needed, no AI assistance, just pure focus and curiosity. Oh, how I really miss those days :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the first several editions (two? three?) were in Pascal, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time I saw TP was on my uncle's Kaypro, which was sort of even more amazing: the screen wasn't capable of blue, the keyboard didn't have an F1 key, and the CPU wasn't capable of instant compilation. But the alternatives were assembly language and Microsoft BASIC!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For assembly, by any chance, do you like the "pink shirt" book? It is one of my all-time favorites! I learned so much from it back in the day. Sadly, I lost my copy somewhere along the way :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never actually read it! I'm not sure what I would recommend if someone asked me for an introductory assembly-language book recommendation. Probably something for ARM or AMD64?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For clarification, I meant the Algorithms, 4th Edition book at https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/ which is entirely in Java. All the example code, libraries, and exercises there use Java, and the authors explicitly note that the book is written for that language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, you are right, Prof. Sedgewick has long maintained versions of his material across multiple languages. I remember that the third edition has C, C++ and Java versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To reduce the current monomorphism, I might add a generic version using void* and a comparator, or generate code for a few key types, while keeping the simple monomorphic listings for readability. (Though this would make the code a bit more complex)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sedgewick published a C++ version of his book using templates for parametric polymorphism, but C++ is kind of a nightmare of a language. Unfortunately algorithms like quicksort really seem to demand parametric polymorphism, and the alternative languages with parametric polymorphism such as Haskell and ML mostly make memory allocation implicit, which runs counter to your goals. Rust offers both explicit memory management and parametric polymorphism, but Rust code is not very clean. Digital Mars D might be a possible alternative? But none of Rust, D, Pony, Zig, Nim, Odin, or even C++ are as widely understood as C, Python, and JS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sedgewick's C edition is the book that first showed me that programs can be beautiful. His favorite algorithm is of course Quicksort. His version of the partition function from Algorithms in C (01998 edition) is, I think, worth studying:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;int partition(Item a[], int l, int r) { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r]; for (;;) { while (less(a[++i], v)) ; while (less(v, a[--j])) if (j == l) break; if (i &amp;gt;= j) break; exch(a[i], a[j]); } exch(a[i], a[r]); return i; }&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some things to dislike in this presentation, like naming a variable "l", the rather excessively horizontal layout, and the brace style. And of course he picked Hoare's original branchy partition algorithm rather than Lomuto's simpler one. But I think there are some other choices that are beneficial:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• He's using short variable names to let the algorithm speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• He uses a type Item (perhaps a typedef) to make the distinction clear between the type of array elements and the type of array indices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• Similarly, he's using exch and less functions to abstract away the comparison and exchange operations. In the Golang standard library implementation, these are actually methods on the container to be sorted taking indices as arguments, so the concrete item type doesn't appear in the algorithm at all, which I think is an important insight. Of course the numerous&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be possible to use the C preprocessor to compile specialized versions of the function for particular data types and comparators in a type-safe way by redefining Item, exch, and less, but of course when you do that the error messages are difficult to decipher. (But exch can't be just a regular function, because C passes arguments by value.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sedgewick's original presentation in the book (from the 01983 edition) inlines the partitioning into the Quicksort loop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;procedure quicksort(l, r: integer) var v, t, i, j: integer; begin if r &amp;gt; l then begin v := a[r]; i := l-1; j := r; repeat repeat i := i+1 until a[i] &amp;gt;= v; repeat j := j-1 until a[j] &amp;lt;= v; t := a[i]; a[i] := a[j]; a[r] := t; until j &amp;lt;= i; a[j] := a[i]; a[i] := a[r]; a[r] := t; quicksort(l, i-l); quicksort(i+1, r) end end;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my perspective the C edition is an enormous improvement. I don't have a copy of the (Pascal) second edition to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third C++ edition (01998) looks almost identical to the C version, except that it's templatized on the Item type, which in C++ also permits you to use static ad-hoc polymorphism (funciton overloading) for the exch function and the comparison operator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;template &amp;lt;class Item&amp;gt; int partition(Item a[], int l, int r) { int i = l-1, j = r; Item v = a[r]; for (;;) { while (a[++i] &amp;lt; v) ; while (v &amp;lt; a[--j]) if (j == l) break; if (i &amp;gt;= j) break; exch(a[i], a[j]); } exch(a[i], a[r]); return i; }&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He illustrates the dynamic behavior of sorting algorithms in multiple ways. One is a vertical time sequence of horizontal arrays of letters, circling the pointed-to elements and graying out the unchanged ones. Another, which can scale to larger arrays, is showing a small-multiple time sequence of scatterplots, like a comic strip, where the X coordinate is the array index and the Y coordinate is the element value at that array index. (A variant of this draws bars whose heights are the element values.) From my perspective, static visualizations like this should be preferred over animation when applicable (https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/), but this case is maybe on the borderline where both animation and static visualization have unique merits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My own terse presentation of Lomuto's algorithm is http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/paperalgo#addtoc_21. I don't think it reaches the clarity of an exposition in C or Python, but it is much easier to write on a whiteboard. I do think that expressing the partition subroutine in terms of an operation on a Golang-like slice improves the clarity significantly. In C or C++ you could pass a base pointer and a length; perhaps Sedgewick didn't want to expose students to this aspect of C arrays, or perhaps he was still constrained by Pascal thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After finishing this book, I think extracting the Go code into a ready-to-use data structures and algorithms library could be a nice idea. I feel confident writing production-grade Go code, so it would be interesting to shape the examples into something practical and reusable beyond just learning exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the very well written and detailed explanation! I think from your comment I finally see a clearer path to a better implementation. Based on my own experience, I will probably start by writing it in Go first (that is the language I can think in most naturally), and then try to reason about how to make an idiomatic C version afterward, which will be interesting since I have not really written C in about 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice to see that you are still around with this after your https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448525 was flagged because of LLM slop issues of your work. How are you addressing those?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i am working on something pretty radical in this space. it is a book of algorithms that derives all the algorithms without telling what the algorithm is. for example for binary search your book quickly went into the low + high / 2 = mid thing. my method is radically different. i take an even sized array then try to actually find it step by step , then take an odd sized array , find it step by step, derive a general hypothesis and then create the formula from it for that algorithm. this is going to be orders of magnitude above any data structures and algorithms books and courses when it comes out. pinky promise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found a neat way to do high-quality "semantic soft joins" using embedding vectors[1] and the Hungarian algorithm[2] and I'm turning it into an open source Python package:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It hits a sweet spot by being easier to use than record linkage[3][4] while still giving really good matches, so I think there's something there that might gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see you saved a spot to show how to use it with an alternative embedding model. It would be nice to be able to use the library without an OpenAI api key. Might even make sense to vendor a basic open source model in your package so it can work out of the box without remote dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm planning out-of-the-box support for nomic[1] which can run in-process, and ollama which runs as a local server and supports many free embedding models[2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're adding more LLM integration, a cool feature might be sending the results of allow_many="left" off to an LLM completions API that supports structured outputs. Eg imagine N_left=1e5 and N_right=1e5 but they are different datasets. You could use jellyjoin to identify the top ~5 candidates in right for each left, reducing candidate matches from 1e10 to 5e5. Then you ship the 5e5 off to an LLM for final scoring/matching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently building my own coding agent, VT Code. VT Code is a Rust-based terminal coding agent with semantic code intelligence via Tree-sitter (parsers for Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java) and ast-grep (structural pattern matching and refactoring).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenRouter, Z.AI, Moonshot AI, all with automatic failover, prompt caching, and token-efficient context management. Configuration occurs entirely through vtcode.toml, sourcing constants from vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs and model IDs from docs/models.json to ensure reproducibility and avoid hardcoding. [0], [1], [2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I've added Agent Client Protocol (ACP) integration. VT Code is now a fully compatible ACP agent, works with any ACP-clients: Zed (first-class support), Neovim, marimo notebook. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks very exciting! I'm following it and I'll give it a go. Not that I'm unsatisfied with Claude Code for my amateur level, but it's clear incentives are not exactly aligned when using a tool from the token provider xD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love that you've made it open source and that it's in Rust, thanks a lot for the work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your kind words. This is my own research into how coding agent works in practice, I love to explore the underlying technologies of how Claude Code, and Codex and coding agent works in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I choose Rust since I have some familiarity and experience with it, VT Code is of course, AI-assisted, I mainly use Codex to help me build it. Thank you again for checking it out, have a great day! : )&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you! I'm glad that you find this project useful. VT Code my current passion on how agent coding works and how far I can push myself to build one (with AI-assisted). I will keep developing and improve it. Currently I'm planning to run Terminal-bench to see how VT Code performs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kindly let me know how your experience about Zed integration, I have done the ACP integration and merge to upstream Agent Client Protocol spec from Zed. The integration experience is quite magical, honestly. It's working in Zed , though for tool calls I'm still improving https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your very kind-words. I love building and agentic coding is my current curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I’m curious though, how significant do you think it is for the agent to have semantic access through Tree-sitter?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this, I'm really not sure, but since the start of building VT Code. I just had this idea to use tree-sitter to assist the agent to have more (or faster/more precise) semantic understanding of the coding, instead of relying them to figure out themself. For me, naively I think this could help agent to have better language-specific and accurately decision about the workspace (context) that they are working. If not having tree-sitter, I think the agent could eventually figure out itself. For this aspect, I should be research more on this topic. In VT Code, I included 6 language: Go, Python, Rust, TypeScript, Swift... ) via rust-binding crates, mostly when you launch the vtcode agent on any workspace, It will show the main languages in the workspace right way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Also what model have you had the most success with ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm having mainly limited-budget so I can only use OpenRouter and utilize its vast amount models support. So that I can prototype quickly, for different use-cases. For VT Code agent, I'm using mainly x-ai/grok-code-fast-1, in my experience, it most suit for building VT Code agent it self because of speeds, and versatile in function calling and have good instruction following. I also have good successes with x-ai/grok-4-fast. I have not tried claude-4.5-sonnet and gpt-5/gpt-5-codex though. I really love to run benchmarks for VT Code to see how it perform in real world coding task, I'm aiming for Aider polygot bench, terminal-bench and swe-bench-lite, it is in my plan for now in my GitHub issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For VT Code itself, I instruct it to strictly follow system-prompt, in which I take various inspiration from Anthropic, OpenAI and Devin guide/blogs on how to build coding agent. But, for a model-agnostic agent, the capability to support multi providers and multi models is a challenge. For this I think I need help. I'm fortunately to have support from open-source community suggesting me to use zig, I have had good success with it so far, for implement LLM calls and implement the /model picker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall in my experience building VT, the most important aspect of effective coding agent is context engineering, like all big-lab has research. A good system prompt is also very important, but not context is everything. https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode/blob/main/prompts/system.md&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;// Sorry, English is not my main language, so pardon the typo and grammar. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microlandia, the brutally honest city builder. Posting this for a second time, because i’ve been working super hard on a steam release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;last month’s “what are you working on” thread impulsed me to upload this game to itch and 1 month later, i’ve got a small community, lots of feedback and iterations. It brought a whole new life to a project that was on the verge of abandoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if you simulate at individual level or group? Would be cool at individual level each one making decisions individually and see some emerging behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also how corruption emerges in gov etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also if no job maybe they could try uber/food delivery crappy jobs like that or start their own business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe also less money less likely to have kids? Would be nice to show how poverty helps or not population growth. If too poor might have no education and would make kids, if average citizen and can’t save money will avoid kids. That’s why at individual level simulation could find these emerging patterns. But probably too expensive computationally ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I wonder if you simulate at individual level or group? Would be cool at individual level each one making decisions individually and see some emerging behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are referring to the citizens, yes, at individual level. However for traffic I'm using a sampling rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Also if no job maybe they could try uber/food delivery crappy jobs like that or start their own business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's an awesome idea, I added it to my backlog :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; less money less likely to have kids?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is mega tricky, because it happens very differently across the world. Yes, can be expensive computationally that's why the city is so small (for now) but as I start to distribute the simulation into many cores, players with high core CPU will be able to choose a bigger city size :) I agree that individual level simulation is what makes it interesting and I plan to keep it like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Brutally honest? I hope it shows the huge amount of land needed for parking lots :P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parking space simulation is coming soon. I feel I will completely miss the point if I leave that out. The idea is to have street parking (with configurable profit for the city) parking lots, and buildings with underground parking, that should conflict, of course, with metro lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public transport is the next thing I wanna work on. Will start with buses, which I have an idea on how it will be implemented, but for metro I will want to start learning about how it can be simulated faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This weekend I have plans to start playing a lot Subway Builder (https://www.subwaybuilder.com) which I'm really excited about, and maybe get some books on the subject, in order to get it right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's something I haven't thought about, but I 100% agree that it should be possible! Very soon I want to introduce roads with bicycle lanes, that have less car bandwidth, that will make me refactor the traffic simulation and the idea of a bicycle-only road type will become possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Venice (the Italian one) - cars, mopeds and bikes are all banned. Most trade goods are transported around by a man moving fast with a sack truck shouting 'Attencion!'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a dev and also a private pilot. Currently I'm working on Pilot Kit: https://air.club/ , a mobile app born from my own frustration with the amount of tedious paperwork in aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an all-in-one toolkit designed to automate the boring stuff so you can focus on flying. Core features include: automatic flight tracking that turns into a digital logbook entry, a full suite of E6B/conversion calculators, customizable checklists, and live weather decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s definitely not a ForeFlight killer, but it's a passion project I'm hoping can be useful for other student and private pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- You can precisely tweak every shade/tint so you can incorporate your own brand colors. No AI or auto generation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- It helps you build palettes that have simple to follow color contrast guarantees by design e.g. all grade 600 colors have 4.5:1 WCAG contrast (for body text) against all grade 50 colors, such as red-600 vs gray-50, or green-600 vs gray-50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- There's export options for plain CSS, Tailwind, Figma, and Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- It uses HSLuv for the color picker, which makes it easier to explore accessible color combinations because only the lightness slider impacts the WCAG contrast. A lot of design tools still use HSL, where the WCAG contrast goes everywhere when you change any slider which makes finding contrasting colors much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Check out the included example open source palettes and what their hue, saturation and lightness curves look like to get some hints on designing your own palettes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's probably more for advanced users right now but I'm hoping to simplify it and add more handholding later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really open to any feedback, feature requests, and discussing challenges people have with creating accessible designs. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've sorted the colors by luminance/lightness and added a gray swatch for comparison so can explore which color pairs pass WCAG contrast checks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't really gotten into colorblind safe colors like this yet where the colors mostly differ by hue and not luminance. Colorblind and non-colorblind people should be able to tell colors apart based on luminance difference i.e. luminance contrast. Hue perception is impacted by the several different kinds of color blindness so it's much trickier to find a set of colors that everyone can tell apart. This relates to the WCAG recommendation you don't rely on hue (contrast) to convey essential information (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.htm...).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gray swatch above could be called colorblind safe for example because as long as you pick color pairs with enough luminance contrast between them, colorblind and non-colorblind people should be able to tell them apart. You could even vary the hue and saturation of each shade to make it really colorful, as a long as you don't change the luminance values the WCAG contrast between pairings should still pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get that you say it is for advanced users, but I think a "how to use this" link with a video in it that explained a few things would probably open it up to a lot more users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's so much more to do with tools like this, and I'm really glad to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Drag the hue and saturation curves to customise the tints/shades of a color. Look at the UI mockup as you do this to make sure the tints/shades look good together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- The color pairings used in the UI mockup all initially pass WCAG contrast checks but this can break if you tweak the lightness curve of a color. The mockup will show warning outlines if this happens. Click on a warning and it'll tell you which color pairs need to have their lightness values moved further apart to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Once you're happy, use the export menu to use your colors in your CSS or Figma designs. You can use the mockup as a guide for which color pairs are accessible for body text, headings, button outlines and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does that make more sense? You really need to be on desktop as well because the mobile UI is more of a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the feedback! Yeah, I appreciate there's a lot of background here around color palette design, UI design, color spaces, and accessibility so I likely need something like a video or tutorial. Another route is to have the tool start in a less freeform mode that handholds you through the process more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s built on a dataset and paper I wrote called CommonForms, where I scraped CommonCrawl for hundreds of thousands of fillable form pages and used that as a training set:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next step is training and releasing some DETRs, which I think will drive quality even higher. But the ultimate end goal is working on automatic form accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reality-bending anomaly game where you are the anomaly: as you interact with items in your environment, you may notice some anomalies. Moving a cookie jar opens the fridge door. Closing the fridge door makes a painting on the wall shrink, and rotating that painting switches the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is for the game to make logical sense, but make the player sound completely unhinged from reality "I need to put the toaster on top of the oven to make the lamp spin around, that way I can move the lamp across the room near the couch to unlock the next level"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on an open source Heroku / Fly.io / Render alternative: https://canine.sh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its built on top of Kubernetes, based on learnings I've had from previous experiences scaling infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at the markup PaaS (Heroku, Fly, Render) applies to IaaS (AWS, Hetzner), it's on the order of 5-10x. But not having that, and trying to stitch together random AWS services is a huge PITA for a medium sized engineering team (we've tried).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of all that, theres a whole host of benefits to being on kubernetes, namely, that you can install any helm package with one click, which Canine also manages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good example is Sentry -- even though it has an open source offering, almost everyone pays for the cloud version because its too scary to self host. With Canine, its a one click, and you get a sentry.your-domain.com to use for whatever you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently got a sponsorship from the Portainer team to allow me to dedicate way more time to this project, so hugely grateful to them for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd say the biggest difference is in the backend -- canine is built on top of kubernetes, which is what lets it leverage the rich ecosystem of tooling and packages. Kubernetes has a reputation for being difficult to use, and so Canine tries to be super opinionated, and follow a set of best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd like to think at this point (about 2 years into development) we've gotten to a place where the end user doesn't even know they are using Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to serve the laws in a format that is easy to cite, monitor, or machine-read. It should also have predictable URLs that can be inferred from the law’s name. It will also have side by side AI translations (marked as such).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cite a lot of laws in my content and I want to automatically flag content for review when a specific paragraph of the law changes. I also want to automatically update my tax calculator when the values change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, a refresh of gestetze-im-internet.de and buzer.de.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's really important I think. Tangentially, https://ecfr.gov/ is bizarrely one of the most impressive websites I have encountered. It's regulations not laws but it has so many ways to discover and link and learn and trace back to law. I'm not a lawyer but it's been a great resource for understanding and surprisingly pleasant to read. I found learning about the whole law and regulation machinery and provenance via eCFR pretty fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dunno if other governments are this Byzantine in practice (our system seems to be like... manual integration of diff patches) but it's pretty interesting and I really appreciate the work that goes into these types of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not actively planning for it, as I'm building this to fix a specific problem I have. However, it will be a static API and an SPA frontend, and both will be open source. The frontend should be fairly easy to reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been suffering from migraines for the last month, so have channeled my (non-migraine) time into a migraine tracker to try and find the root causes. All the tracking apps I tried all have nice complex forms, which is all well and good, unless...you are having a migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rough idea is easy to use voice mode to record data, then analyze unstructured data with AI later on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to track all relevant life information, so what I'm eating, meds I'm taking, headache/nausea levels, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding records is as easy as pressing record on my apple watch and speaking some kind of information. Uses Deepgram for voice transcription since it's the best transcription API I've found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will then send all information through to a LLM for analysis. It has a "chat with your data" page to ask questions and try and draw conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main webapp is done, now working on packaging it into an iOS app so I can pull biometrics from Healthkit. Will then look into releasing it, either on github or possibly in the app store. It's admittedly mostly vibe coded, so not sure if it'll be something releasable, but we'll see...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing because it was such an obvious insight once I discovered it and I’ve suffered from migraines for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blood sugar. Turned out I was having hypos. I’ve found now that just a spoonful of honey when I feel them coming on normally reduces my migraines to headaches, which I can manage myself with paracetamol&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry - not directly related to your post but still perhaps useful&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a fellow migraineur, I feel compelled to point out that the quest for triggers and root causes is probably never going to end. The way I see it, the migraine "bucket" slowly fills up, and the final trigger is simply the drop that makes it run over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can suggest the research papers by Markus Dahlem for some in depth modern takes on migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's definitely bucket-like for me, and I can attest meditation empties it. Whenever I stop meditating, mental busyness and subconscious anxiety slowly build up. Half hour a day is enough to keep it away. I just keep bringing my attention back to the breath, trying to feel into the physiological need to breathe (which is usually occluded or distorted by mental activity). Whenever I feel I am actively holding to some tension, I allow myself to release it. That's all in terms of instructions, and for me it works wonders. I look at it as the equivalent of flossing for the brain ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, as for a lot of people, lack of sleep is the big one... if I build up 4+ hours of sleep debt over a week, I'm at risk. So anything you can do to make that easier to log, like integration with a sleep tracker, would be good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, a plug for Oliver Sacks's Migraine which taught me a lot about migraine with aura.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it’s an iPhone app the new on device transcription api in ios26 works well and is very fast. You could also use the ondevice llm to clean up the transcription. Cheaper and more privacy friendly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current project also revolves around using voice notes to log life events. I'd love to talk and see if we could exchange some ideas. My Gmail username is the same as my HN username.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, depending on the people you meet, and the roles you are in, any kind of social contact can be mentally draining, even if it is not directly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that even the anticipation of meeting people can be a mental load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to work on a Low Power FM community radio station for the East San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. We have started promoting and putting on local events and are trying to fund raise to build out the station. Raising money is hard! We did a big show in Burbank where several hundred people showed up but we only netted $800 after expenses. :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this is hackernews, i'll add that i'm building the website and archiving system using haskell and htmx, but what is currently live is a temp static html site. https://github.com/solomon-b/kpbj.fm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is sick - I happen to run a site for DIY and community organizations like yours. We have proven the best way to fundraise is to throw events like you did but to upsell people on a recurring donation when they get the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the off chance you are throwing another event, I would love to help you raise much more than $800 one time (my site is https://withfriends.events/)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short answer is I would just recommend one of the tons of tax software out there specific to LLC, individual, 501c3. My site helps with the raising money part and just integrates and gives advice for that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be a naive question which you've probably been asked plenty of times before so I'm sorry of I'm being tedious here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it really worth the effort and expense to have a real radio station these days? Wouldn't an online stream be just as effective if it was promoted well locally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years ago a friend who was very much involved in a local community group which I was also somewhat interested in asked me if I wanted to help build a low power FM station. He asked me because I know something about radio since I was into ham radio etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was skeptical that it was worth the effort. The nerdy part of me would have enjoyed doing it but I couldn't help thinking that an online stream would probably reach as many people without the hassle and expensive of a transmitter, antenna etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it's a toss up. Every car has an FM radio. Not everyone is going to have a phone plugged in to Android Auto or Apple Car Play and have a good data plan and have a solid connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also pointed out that the technical effort is probably the small part compared to producing interesting content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Radio is COOL. As a fellow ham I think you would agree with me on this one so I'll leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Internet streaming gives you wider but far less localized audience. We will have an internet stream, but being radio first shifts the focus to local community and local content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Internet streaming and radio have related but not entirely overlapping histories and contexts which impacts how people produce and consume their content. I love the traditional formats of radio and they are often completely missing in online radio which IMO models itself more often on mixtape and club DJ culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. AI slop is ruining the world. I have this belief that as AI slop further conquers the internet we are going to get to a place where nobody trusts internet content. People will seek out novelty and authenticity (sort of how LLMs do lol) and I think there will be a return to local content and community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Commercial radio sucks. The LPFM system is a wonderful opportunity to create a strong, community driven alternative to corporate media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radio is so much fun to learn. It’s liberating to learn for curiosity and joy rather than commercialization. The community is welcoming, and while not directly translatable for most paid work, it does teach general problem solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a local medical AI app for Mac, recently published on the App Store. https://apple.co/4mlYANu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses medgemma 4B for analyzing medical images and generating diagnostic insights and reports, ofc must be used by caution, its not for real diagnostics, can be something to have another view maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, it supports chat and report generation, but I'm stuck on what other features to add beyond these. Also experimenting with integrating the 27B model, even with 4bit quantization, looks better than 4b.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've become a bit addicted to online education. I finished my first masters degree in Computer Science in July, and I started a masters in Mathematics from The Open University at the beginning of October. I've wanted to really get into the weeds of obscure and arguably-useless math for about as long as I can remember, and I figure that getting a masters in it is as good a way to get that knowledge as any way else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than that, I've been doing a lot of fixing of tech debt in my home network from the last six years. I've admittedly kind of half-assed a lot of the work with my home router and my server and my NAS and I want these things to be done correctly. (In fairness to me, I didn't know what I was doing back when I started, and I'd like to think I know a fair bit better now).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, when I first built my server, I didn't know about ZFS datasets, so everything was on the main /tank mount. This works but there are advantages to having different settings for different parts of the RAID and as such I've been dividing stuff into datasets (which has the added advantage of "defragging" because this RAID has grown by several orders of magnitude and as a result some of the initial files were fragmented).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I enjoy exploring AI-assisted process development. Things I've learned are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Building nôn pipelines for generating placeholder art. GPT-5 excels at writing code nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* LLM for LaTeX generation (note: GPT-5 generally fails at even moderately complex LaTeX and often adds complexity while endlessly orbiting the problem without solving it. On of the other hand, it's failed solutions eventually give me enough datapoints to develop the correct solution on my own. Probably faster than learning enough LaTeX to develop them on my own. Sadly I can fix broken LaTeX much easier than writing correct LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Using LaTeX to read card data out of CSVs is difficult to get right (esp with embedded LaTeX) but honestly pretty good for rapid prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Searching games for mechanics to solve specific interaction problems is an ok-ish problem for GPT-5. I wish I had a vector DB of indexed PDF manuals for the top 5k bgg games, but that's too big of a problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's incredibly cheap and easy to generate reasonable approximations of thematic text sufficient for a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, I went from idea to first round of playtesting in about 2-3 weeks. Previous similar attempts had been 2-3 months. I feel quite a bit less attached to darlings, but the downside is a bit of shame attached to having playtesters work around errors originating from AI usage rather than errors generated by my own oversights&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on Forvard https://forvard.org — a tiny desktop app to help people remember what they actually did at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s offline-first and totally local (no cloud, no tracking). You just drop in your accomplishments, metrics, or files as you go, and later it helps you summarize them (ML model that runs locally) for performance reviews, promotions, or interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically built it because I got tired of trying to reconstruct a year’s worth of work from Slack and Jira the night before review time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a one-time $0.99 download for macOS, Windows, and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious if others have tried building similar “career memory” tools or have thoughts on what’s missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love feedback from people who’ve struggled to keep track of their work accomplishments or prep for performance reviews!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My side project - https://macrosforhumans.com - is a traditional mobile macro tracker with first class support for voice (and soon image and text blob) inputs for your recipes, ingredients, measurements, units, etc. Kind of a neat project that may never make it too far off the ground considering I am not a mobile dev but it's been fun to build so far with the help of claude code. It's built with flutter and a fastapi backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the AI macro food logging world, there's really only Cal AI which estimates macros based on an image. I use cronometer personally, and it's super annoying to have to type everything in manually, so it makes sense why folks reach for something like Cal AI. However, the problem with something like Cal AI is accuracy. It's at best a guess based on the image. Macros for humans tries to be more of a traditional weigh your food, log it, etc kind of app, while updating the main interface for how users input that info into something more friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I set myself a hard deadline to present a live demo at a local showcase/pitch event thing at the end of the month. I bet the procrastination will kick in hard enough to get the backend hosted with a proper database and a bit more UI polish running on my phone. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a really early demo video I recorded a few weeks ago. I had just spoken the recipe on the left and when I stop recording you can see my backend streams the objects out as they're parsed from the LLM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4wElkvJR7I&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here on Croatian islands maritime traffic disruptions and power outages happen often. Constantly checking websites or searching paper notifications stuck on random street lamp posts is a no-go and timely information is important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a mini-project which monitors official resources on the web and sends email notifications on time. Currently covering around 15000 inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the beginnings of a web-based “choose your own adventure” book builder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure other such things exist, but I wanted to build one with a focus on a natural authoring process - no HTML or Markdown, just one plain text so you can quickly type your way to fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary users (both for authoring and playing the books) will be my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also getting a kick out of building it with zero dependencies (I’m not counting the linter/formatter, Biome) in JavaScript), especially enjoying writing tests with just `node:assert`.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m planning on making it themeable in the style of CSS Zen Garden - I.e. you can’t change the generated HTML but you can style it with CSS however you like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on it for the last two years as a side project, but starting March will be my full time job! Kind of excited and scared at the same time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! With respect tothe transtion I think everyones case is different. On my case, I am not an entrepeneur, I didn't aspire to create a company and it wasn't my intentions to make money out of IronCalc. I thought it was a missing piece in our current tech stack and turn out that many other people were interested. Firs I got a grant from the nlNet[1]. That wasn't enough for me to live of but paved the way to what was coming. Many different companies took an interest and I started havin emails from different folks about how to integrate IronCalc. Some of them were happy to spend some money on it, but I couldn't take it because of my day job. Goverments got interested (!) [2]. I realized there might be ways for me to have a modest living and push the vission I have for IronCalc for another two years. There are many things I could say on the topic, if you like to chat feel free to send me an email. I'm always happy to help&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on an dedicated offline space. Screen device are stored to a locker. Serves coffee and beverages and light food. (There will be a small separate space for occasional screen/internet access in case of need)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on the idea for about a year now. I have put up the funds and set up the corporation. Been busy designing the menu, scouting an ideal location and finding the right front-end staff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sounds like my retirement plan: coffee shop + book store. I tend to buy old engineering and mathematics textbooks (my collection has suffered losses through multiple moves, unfortunately) and I find that these are typically overlooked at normal bookstores and even libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building FlightWise (https://flightwise.io), an all-in-one SaaS platform for flight school operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After acquiring a flight school, I quickly realized how challenging the day-to-day operations were. To solve the problems of aircraft fleet management, scheduling, and student course progress tracking, I developed a comprehensive platform that handles all aspects of running a flight school. Existing software is often outdated and expensive, offering poor value for its high cost. FlightWise was built off the real world experiences of my own school, where it has delivered immediate and invaluable benefits to our entire team, from students to administrative staff. We've just recently started to offer this platform publicly to other flight schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! Really happy with its current state but it'll be further fleshed out a lot more in the near future with dedicated pages for each major feature set, e.g Bookings, Safety Management System, Simulator Management etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you! Started development around August 2024 and 2 months later we had it in use at our school in a very early state, and then over time added more huge features, such as bookings, etc. About 4 months ago, we fully moved away from the existing antiquated platform we were paying for, as FlightWise reached a complete feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a open-source tool to create photo galleries from a folder of photos: https://simple.photo. It creates galleries as static sites that are easy to self-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started this out of frustration that there is no good tool I could use to share photos from my travel and of my kids with friends and family. I wanted to have a beautiful web gallery that works on all devices, where I can add rich descriptions and that I could share with a simple link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turned out more people wanted this (got 200+ GitHub stars for the V1) so I recently released the V2 and I'm working on it with another dev. Down the road we plan a SaaS offer for people that don't want to fiddle with the CLI and self-host the gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the layout tiles you have for the photo thumbnails. Will dig through and learn some css. Have struggled with different size content to create a compact masonry layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CSS for this is indeed tricky. I figured out this layout 5 years ago in the v1 and forgot how it works, just took it over as it looks good. The key is that not all rows are exactly the same height. There are small differences that allow photos to fit horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tried the vertical masonry layout, which looks good, but makes no sense if your photos have a chronological order...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a tool to auto-label emails in Gmail (first) based on what you've labeled in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It pulls down up to 400 emails for each custom label and creates a custom model just for you, that will label new incoming email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For emails that are likely, but not certain to be a particular label, I use a 'Proposed/{label}' approach which lets you just archive them in Gmail, and it will detect that they've been archived with the proposed label and move them to the correct label. (Essentially using the archive action as an acceptance criteria.) Similarly I use re-labeling by the user as a negative signal, and include that data as a counter-example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's working well for my own accounts, and the back-end is pretty legendary, but Google requires a hefty cost to audit security in order to turn it into a real product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It always frustrated me that Google won't use their ML systems to label emails for me based on what I've done before. So I scratched that itch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using very straightforward BERT models right now, but I'm exploring using something a little more intelligent. I'm also exploring a multi-stage process, because a lot of emails can be categorized using much simpler techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a great Machine Learning project, with a back-end that really runs spectacularly on Temporal and Kubernetes, and it's useful to me, so...wins all around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An open source website I built to explain tensor functions in PyTorch: https://whytorch.org&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It makes tricky functions like torch.gather and torch.scatter more intuitive by showing element-level relationships between inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For any function, you can click elements in the result to see where they came from, or elements in the inputs to see how they contribute to the result to see exactly how it contributes to the result. I found that visually tracing tensor operations clarifies indexing, slicing, and broadcasting in ways reading that the docs can't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also jump straight to WhyTorch from the PyTorch docs pages by modifying the base URL directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I launched a week or two back and now have the top post of all time on r/pytorch, which has been pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This really nice. For `torch.mul(x, y)`, it would be nice if it highlighted the entire row or column in the other matrix and result. Right now it shows only a single multiplication, which gives a misleading impression of how matrix multiply works. I wouldn't mention it, except that matrix multiplication is so important that it's worth showcasing. I've bookmarked the site and will share it at a pytorch training session I'm leading in a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a small side project called https://www.localgeoguessr.com/ — a fun geography game that tests how well you know your local area. It’s still in a very early stage, not polished yet, but it’s somewhat playable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to eventually add more categories like “restaurants,” “theaters,” “roads,” etc., so you can play based on local themes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your thoughts - any feedback on what you’d like to see, what feels off, or any issues you run into would be super helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought your idea was really cool so I gave it a go. I live about 20 minutes from a minor US city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All but 1 prompts were in a 3-block radius IN the city (again, about 20 minutes from my town's town hall).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the 1 prompt I didn't know I guessed the same 3 block radius as the others, and it was about 2 miles away. Still in the city, not the town I typed in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like smaller towns will be gobbled up by famous cities elements. Especially here in New England where the majority of 'famous' local things are so few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: also, changing the 'radius' resets the city to where the website THINKS I am instead of where I typed in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's really fun! Thank you. On the result screen, let me click on the locations so that I can learn more about them. Some museums I didn't know and would click immediately to learn more about them. Or even add a little explanation of what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Love this. I chose a small village and got a few clues like "War memorial", I'd bet there are many War Memorials in the 10km radius - so was impossible to know which one it meant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Made a partially open source event platform for Pickleball and Badminton in Asia. Apart from managing event attendance, reminders, waitlist, level restrictions, and calendar syncing, there is also a pretty thorough Event Manager built in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The event manager has a built-in ELO-style rating system designed for computer games and applies it to offline sports. You tap on the winning pair and it automatically calculates new ratings offline. It takes the attendees from the event automatically, and can manage taking turns evenly, placing players of similar level together and balancing matches. It can also do all of that while handling players who come in and out at random times, or matchmaking for fixed pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what problem does it solve? The event manager is a solution for anyone who organizes slightly larger groups of players. So instead of a a paddle queue or random-round robin tables, an event can be managed by level at a very granular level fully automatically. Players just go to the court they are assigned and they'll be put in a balanced competitive match automatically. At the end of the match the players just tap on the winning team. I think commercial facilities or clubs could also benefit from using this as it can do matchmaking for "open play" style events, but this is an open source side project and I have no intention of making any sales pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://www.pkuru.com - please check it out and if you are visiting Tokyo or Bangkok you can join the Pickleball events straight from the website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Penteglot - a fork of Emacs's Eglot LSP client with multi-server support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main feature: you can run multiple language servers simultaneously for the same buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons people stick with lsp-mode over Eglot has been the lack of multi-server support. Eglot is otherwise the most "emacsy" LSP client, so I'm working on filling that gap and I hope it could be merged into Emacs one day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is still WIP but I've been using it for a while for Python (basedpyright or pyrefly + ruff for linting) and TypeScript (ts-ls + eslint + tailwind language server).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a little website that helps me and my friends to decide easier what to play on a gamenight, because it always goes like this: - I want to play x and y - I want to play y and z - I don't have z - I don't really feel x - Lets play b - I'd rater play c - Let's settle on d - Today H is joining, he does not have d&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It'll work in sessions where first everyone can suggest games, then in the second phase veto out suggestions, then vote and it'll display the games with the highest vote. You can also manage/import a list of your games and it'll show who owns what. It's geared towards video games, but will work for board games too. Hope to release it for everyone in the next weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds great. Would everyone "accept" the result, or would it be worth adding a little LLM explanation of why the result should content everyone by explaining how the game retains elements or this other voted game and that other voted game, to try and make people go "ok, sure"? I'm not a huge gamer so maybe this is an obvious reaction they would get from their own experience when seeing the result without needing a LLM explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe far down the road. For now I'm fine with a minimal tool that does not aim to take out the human interaction in the group haha. If the tool finds a small community more features might be added like content-based recommendations, but I don't want to drive up the costs right now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been sporadically working on a passion-project web app that displays a map of where my family's native language is spoken and where different dialectal variations of a user-supplied word are spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all started when I was first learning the language and was having a lot of trouble understanding different dialects, I want to make sure this is not a problem for future learners!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's my first major project so it has been quite the learning experience, especially when it comes to infrastructure/hosting. The project is still pretty early on but I hope to show it off soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Redesigning investment holdings for wider screens and leaning on hotwired turbo frames. Thankful for once-campfire as a reference for how to structure the backend. The lazy loading attribute works great with css media queries to display more on larger viewports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enjoying learning modern css in general. App uses tailwind, but did experiment with just css on the homepage. Letting the design emerge organically from using it daily, prototype with tailwind, then slim it back down with plain css.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a DSL and browser-based playground for procedural 3D geometry called Geotoy: https://3d.ameo.design/geotoy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's largely finished and functional, and I'm now focused on polish and adding additional builtin functions to expand its capabilities. I've been integrating different geometry libraries and kernels as well as writing some of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been stress-testing it by building out different scenes from movies or little pieces of buildings on Google Maps street view - finding the sharp edges and missing pieces in the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My hope is for Geotoy to be a relatively easy-to-learn tool and I've invested significantly in good docs, tutorials, and other resources. Now my goal is to ensure it's something worth using for other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Super silly but I'm searching for a mathematical backdoor in Bitcoin's secp and the secr curve. I saw that both curves use unsafe primes (p-1 factors pretty well) for the generator order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm trying to define a multiplication operation using primitive roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is amazing. I work in the construction sector and there are so so so many small one-man tradesperson companies that need to know about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice! I recently built an invoice generator (not open sourced) for my own needs. I built mine because I needed something when I discontinued a SaaS that had provided it. Mine is written in C# and uses a JSON file to define the contents of the invoice. It's run from the command-line and just produces the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you planning to turn this into a full-fledged CRM of some sort? Are you planning to add user login with templates/company fields auto-populated at one point? Looks very clean, congrats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would you do something like this instead of using a cheap script from a codecanyon-type website (a true CRUD crm) where you can collect customer data and provide complete service in the long run? Just saying this because you said you built it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually hadn’t heard of Codecanyon before! I used to use a paid invoicing service, but these days I just need a simple way to generate invoice PDFs - that’s really all I need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use invoice generators that have complete control over your customers. Most scripts are php, and if you want something very detailed I'd go with Perfex. Codecanyon is the biggest code marketplace on the internet, owned by Envato.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if you could just send invoices to Comcast for price increases to their Payable Accounts department and if they'd just pay them. Or just invoice companies for "inconvenience fees" of sorts when they actually create inconveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Userdoc, a spec-driven development workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break down your software requirements (Userdoc guides you through the process), refine/confirm, setup your technical specs, coding/business guidelines &amp;amp; guardrails, and then create development plans (specs) which can be easily consumed by coding agents via MCP, or by platforms like Lovable / v0 using Markdown. Working on Cursor background agent integration atm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on Listening Facts[0] for a while now. Basically, it's a year in review of your listening facts presented in a "nutrition facts" label format. It works with Apple Music, Spotify (via waitlist due to recent API changes[1]), and LastFM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on language detection to expand the "facts" with a language distribution on each generated label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried getting Adsense on the website but I keep getting denied on "Low Content Value" grounds. I tried some alternatives but the quality of their ads was ridiculous (stuff like "your device has a virus, click here to clean it up") so I just gave up on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here[2] you can find what one of the labels looks like and many more from some user submissions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to build my own speech-to-text transcription program [1] for Discord, similar to how zoom or google hangouts works. I built it so that I can record my group's DND sessions and build applications / tools for VTTs (Virtual TableTop gaming).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can process a set of 3-hour audio files in ~20 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really believe that we're going to see this adopted as a standard for on-demand inference specifically from low powered devices. We'll give them a guide of intent and periodically it will get scored. It just makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, sites change and markdown is hard for a lot of people. We take that for granted as technical people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing working on probe.bike to allow you to tell stories as a user from your bikepacking data. See the full route, share the full route, and figure out your totals from calories to kudos. Gonna be doubling down again on this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a break from tech to work on a luxury fashion brand with my mum. She hand paints all the designs. I it first collection is a set of silk scarves and we’re moving into skirts and jackets soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been a wonderful journey to connect with my mum in this way. And also to make something physical that I can actually touch. Tech seems so…ephemeral at times&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, I balked at the price initially, but it actually seems cheap after learning they are hand painted, that's amazing. I can easily imagine there are people willing to pay a lot more for these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some earnest and unsolicited feedback on the website: the scroll-based transition is not really working well, looks very jumpy in Safari/MacOS, maybe interpolating between states will help smooth it out. Design-wise, the blur effect is quite jarring, and the product list screams Shopify store and not luxury brand. You already have pretty good photography, I'd feature the portraits heavily instead of the flat product shot. Invest in great typography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;this is super cool. congrats and best of luck with it! Love the mother &amp;amp; son backstory to the product. The scarves look like they could make a great gift as well. I'll bookmark your website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure what the market is for something like this but it's something I've been thinking a lot about since stepping down as CEO of my previous company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Help teams make better, faster decisions with all context populating a source-of-truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Help leaders stay eyes-on, and circumstantially hands-on, without slowing everything down. What I'd hope to be an effective version of "Founder Mode".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anybody wants to play around with it, here's a link to my staging environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great idea! Great website! Terrible video. The 90 second format is great, this is how much I would like to spend learning what exactly your product does. But the whole video is just clicking some user interfaces with no result. After watching the video, I have even less idea of what it the product is for. I would love to see a video that goes through the "next, next, next" in the wizard and then shows the actual outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great feedback, I'll work on the video ASAP. I intended to immediately create a follow-up video that steps through each component of a newly created decision, got distracted, never circled back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, it seems you are on the path of another 8 fig exit. Good on you. It seems like a great project and could possible save so much time if well executed and well integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've added it to SaaSHub saashub.com/orgtools. If you have an @orgtools.com email you can verify and improve the profile. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a good nudge to choose the grammatically correct option, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I originally had "less meetings" before an LLM corrected me into using "fewer meetings". Then when talking about Orgtools to a couple people I heard them say "less meetings" and switched back thinking that sounds slightly more natural (but incorrect).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a weekly smart home tours newsletter. My pitch is: imagine if nerds were allowed into MTV Cribs. The format will be similar to workspaces.xyz newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently collecting submissions for the first editions. So if you would be interested to feature your smart home, that would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on an open-source agent for privilege access management (PAM) and just-in-time access (JIT) to cloud infrastructure, SaaS applications and local systems. It's using serverless workflows (https://serverlessworkflow.io/) and https://www.temporal.io to guarantee robust deterministic workflow execution. Temporal is used to orchestrate elevations across environments and systems. It tasks “agents” to grant access where it needs to be rather than centralising permission stores. It guarantees execution and revocation of permissions. Run it locally for sudo, UAC. Or in the cloud for IAM or for individual applications. Check it out: https://github.com/thand-io/agent&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious why you chose Temporal, which requires your users to either run an external coordination server or pay Temporal money for theirs? Did you look at DBOS (which doesn't required an external server and can just use your existing database)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It currently supports complex heatmaps based on travel time (e.g. close to work + close to friends + far from police precincts), and has a browser extension to display your heatmap over popular listing sites like Zillow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of making it into an API to allow websites to integrate with it directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely stellar! I've been looking for something like this for ages. Any chance you'll have some pre- defined options like grocery stores, libraries, airport, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Living in hongkong for a few months, and absolutely love exploring the different neighborhoods. I’d love something like this or walkscore but for local guides to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My on again, off again life's work has been a foss dev stack for interactive tutoring systems. Something like a general purpose Math Academy, with mechanics to permit UGC and courses that are both adaptive (to the user's background and demonstrated skill) and inter-adaptive (to the userbase's expressed priorities).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am using this stack now to build an early literacy app targeting kids aged 3-5ish at https://letterspractice.com (also pre-release state, although the email waitlist works I think!). LLM assisted edtech has a lot of promise, but I'm pretty confident I can get the unit cost for teaching someone to read down to 5 USD or less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The docs seem to be highly targeted towards software engineers who want to build the system. There is scant information on how teachers would find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like inventing the refrigerator and all the brochure talk about is the internal engineering of the machine, rather than how keeping food cold is useful from the economic and culinary perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fair point, but I'll emphasize that this is developer documentation and there isn't really an existing product or service targeting consumers, teachers or institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My focus on that front is the LettersPractice app. I taught my own kids (6, 4) to read using early versions of the same software, and I'm pretty confident about the efficacy of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as the broader project moving toward being a consumer facing applications, there are a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The existing platform-ui is a skeleton / concept sketch of one category. A web platform that allows users to create and subscribe to different courses, and then study sessions aggregate content from all subscribed courses. reddit for knowing stuff and having skills, rather than .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another broad category is in NoCode ITSaaS (interactive tutoring system as a service?) platform. EG, a specialized bolt.new for EdTech that uses agentic workflows to create courses that cover a given domain or specific input documents (eg, textbooks, curriculum documents).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whoops, sorry about that. I updated that submission right after writing this post, and re-published the front-end without having committed the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have links to share, because things aren't ready for primetime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A SAAS to help HomeSchool Coop and Collectives build an online presence where they set up member registration, show course offerings, and let parents enroll their students. Main competitor is HomeSchoolLife and this started because our own HS Collective used HSL and hated it; so I thought I'd try. The complexity has grown rapidly, trying to custom roll a CMS because I couldn't get Wagtail to integrate nicely with my site, and Django CMS leverages the Django Admin but I don't want my users to have to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Also playing around with a SAAS targeted at YouTube Car Flippers to be able keep tracking of their current flips and, eventually, research new potential flips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I've got plenty of other unfinished projects that I still tinker with; a real-time version of Words with Friends, because I hated the slow asynchronous gameplay. I started it 12 years ago and then life got in the way. I'm guessing WWF probably has this mechanic now; I don't play anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm calling it a "Micro Functions as a Service" platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What it really is, is hosted Lua scripts that run in response to incoming HTTP requests to static URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's basically my version of the old https://webscript.io/ (that site is mostly the same as it was as long as you ignore the added SEO spam on the homepage). I used to subscribe to webscript and I'd been constantly missing it since it went away years ago, so I made my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mostly just made this for myself, but since I'd put so much effort into it, I figure I'm going to try to put it out there and see if anyone wants to pay me to use it. Turns out there's a _lot_ of work that goes into abuse prevention when you're code from literally anyone on the internet, so it's not ready to actually take signups yet. But, there is a demo on the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been vanlifing for a few months now. I tend to have long hours on the road where my mind wonders and I want to write code hands-free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I built it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using ChatGPT's voice agents to generate Github issues tagging @claude to trigger Claude Code's Github Action, I created https://voicescri.pt that allows me to have discussions with the voice agent, having it create issues, pull requests, and logical diffs of the code generated all via voice, hands free, with my phone in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your van is probably better than mine, but when I was vanlifing with my wife, I really regretted spending so many long hours on the road. If I did it over again, I'd try to limit driving to a max of two hours per day and five hours per week. We spent far too much money on repairs and not nearly enough time writing code or exploring the places I drove through. Or past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you reviewing code by voice, like a blind programmer? Have you tried Emacspeak? I know that's not normally hands-free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haha "better" is definitely relative. It's a 1977 Toyota micromini rv that I purchased for $750.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least 50% of the available storage is tools to fix mechanical, plumbing, and electrical issues that appear, because it is inevitable given the mileage we are putting on. Definitely living a Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance lifestyle at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code review absolutely happens via voice. The voice agent has access to the pull requests and code diffs and is able to reason about the changes and explain them to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also playing around with a tool that opens up a visual preview of the Vercel/Netlify preview deploys so I can explore the (web) changes handsfree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emacspeak is new to me. I'll look into it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mine was a 01983 air-cooled Vanagon with an aftermarket camper conversion. Similarly I had to spend a lot of the available storage on tools, but that didn't really help when I overheated the head and cracked it. Twice. I'm lucky that the leak in the fuel line that sprayed the underside of the van clean with gasoline didn't catch the whole thing on fire before we fixed it. That improved the gas mileage significantly! I hope yours is better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emacspeak has enabled at least some blind programmers to work efficiently, so I think its auditory code formatting abilities are usably good, which probably isn't the case for all screen readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's terrifying. Glad it didn't catch on fire! The motor did blow a few years back and has since been completely rebuilt. Fingers crossed it will last awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm playing around with sandboxing techniques on Mac so I can isolate AI tools and prevent them from interacting with files they shouldn't have access to -- like all my dotfiles, AWS credentials, and such.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along the way I rolled my own git-multi-hook solution (https://github.com/webcoyote/git-multi-hook) to use git hooks for shellcheck-ing, ending files with blank lines, and avoid committing things that shouldn't be in source control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I've used docker and podman. They're great. But I wanted to be able to run Xcode and IOS simulator, which requires macOS, so developed these solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a solo dev working on what started out as an interstitial journalling tool, but is now morphed into a local first native set of tools for thinking and writing. Tools for the end of the internet, you might say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current version is over at https://owl.so but the local first native app (Owl/2) is about to hit beta real soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a microkernel for arm-m33 microcontrollers. Targeting the RP2350 first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s going to feature a synchronous IPC model where the inter-task ‘call graph’ is known at compilation. Function call semantics to pass data between tasks. Call() recieve() reply()&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A build tool that reads TOML will generate the kernel calls so that tasks can be totally isolated — all calls go though supervisor trap so we have true memory isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preemptions are possible but control is yielded only at IPC boundary so it’s not hard realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that makes things super robust and auditable behavior at compile time. Total isolation means tasks can crash catastrophically without affecting the rest of the system. Big downsides are huge increase in flash usage, constrained programming model, complex build system, task switching overhead. Just a very different model than what I’m used to at $dayjob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to basically find out, hey what happens when we go full safety!? What’s hard about it? What tradeoffs do we need to make? And also kinda like what’s a different model for multitasking. Written in Rust of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on a simple SAST like AI code scanning tool. Currently it only uses OpenAI API to do the scanning but maybe if I get access to other APIs I can add them. There are still a lot of features I would like to add but I am building this in two parts, the CLI scanner and the web management UI. At the moment the UI and scanner run together but eventually I want to break this out so that the scanner can just report findings to the UI remotely. This would be nice if running from a CI/CD environment. I eventually also plan to add some sort of scoping to the scanner so it can be targeted to new branches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a tool that automatically generates living infrastructure diagrams from your IaC files and turns them into real-time incident dashboards. Think Figma meets Datadog - beautiful visualization that updates during outages to show you exactly what's failing and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The insight: your architecture diagram shouldn't be a stale PNG in Confluence. It should be your war room during incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going to be available as both web app and native desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interesting challenge was designing for minimal distractions while keeping setup simple for parents. Timer-locked navigation so kids can see what's next but can't start other tasks or switch profiles. Also refactored from schedule-centric (nightmare to maintain) to task-definitions as first-class citizens, which made creating schedules way easier&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;React Native/Expo + Firebase. On the App Store after months of dogfooding with the family&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most recipes are a failure for beginners on the first try. I aim to make recipes bulletproof so anyone can pick up any recipe and it will just work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to make the best recipe app ever. On a technical level recipes are built as graphs and assembled on demand. This makes multilanguage support easy, any recipe can use any unit imaginable, blind people could have custom recipe settings for their needs, search becomes OP, and there is also a wikipedia like database with information that links to all recipes. Because of the graphs; nutritional information, environmental impact, cost etc. can simply be calculated accurately by following linked graphs. Most recipe apps are very targeted to specific geographical regions and languages, this graph system removes a lot of barriers between countries and will also be a blessing to expats. Imagine an American in Europe that wish to use imperial units, english recipes, but with ingredients native to their new homeland. No problem, just follow a different set of nodes and the recipe is created that way for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The website is slightly outdated but gives a good idea of what is coming. Current goal is to do beta launch in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I admire the dedication and love to idea / how much you've thought it trough from the app / logic side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the marketing side...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd make a selection on the website on first visit - I'm a chef / creator - I like to cook&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your cta (call to action) is... Not very effective&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instagram only has 7 followers and no posts. ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like the dedication but I'd definitely recommend to improve your marketing / promotion skills (if you build it they will come is a myth unfortunately...), if you wanna have a call about it feel free to hit me up, tijlatduckdotcom. I'm also in Europe so easy for timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes the marketing is weak. Will definitely have to spend time on that. Currently prioritizing topics related to onboarding beta users. What do you specialize in?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im working on a simple website that converts PDFs into audio. I made it essentially because I didn't find a similar website offering the service at a sane price. Also the TTS services in Swedish (where Im from) is pretty limited... it relies on Google TTS. Have a try and feel free to comment if you have suggestions. https://pagevoice.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little computer vision library for embedded systems, by magnitudes smaller than OpenCV, but still practical enough to do feature tracking or cascade detections. Works well on ESP32 and cheap ARMs with low-resolution grayscale cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on my (mostly) R7RS Scheme Interpreter. I've just finished call-with-current-continuation and exceptions which were rather difficult for me to grok. Currently working on improving the debugging experience before starting the monotonous work on implementing the ~400 required functions and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on an AI-powered fitness and food tracker that automatically logs your food based on the photo. One of the difficulties I had when going to the gym is keeping up and sharing macros weekly with my personal trainer. Manually logging food is a hassle and massive pain point - so my app, Eat n Snap attempts to solve this problem. You can also set weight and BMI goals and see your progress on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suppose you must know this already if you have done research on alternatives, but there are already a plethora of apps like this — Lifesum, Cal AI, MacroFactor, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is hard with only a photo because you can’t always see what’s inside. But I’ve always dreamed of something like this paired with some kind of affordable hardware scanner that can get just enough data to fill in the blanks from the photos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is already a feature in an app called MacroFactor. But there is definitely room for improvement in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that I miss in MacroFactor is that it should have some memory of my previous choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: If I take a picture of a glass of milk, it always assumes it to be whole milk (3.5% fat). Then I change it to a low fat milk (0.5% fat). But no matter how many times I do that, it keeps assuming that the milk in the photo is whole milk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making an OpenAI API proxy to stay within a spending limit (like 1$ per hour then a 429), AFAIK they only support "budget alerts" and I'm not comfortable releasing anything without a hard limit on the spend. https://github.com/goverture/goxy - Still a work in progress, I plan to support streaming as well and might support other providers if there's a demand for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI gives an allotment of free daily tokens if you agree to hand over the inputs as training. I’d love a proxy that places the limit just before you exhaust those free tokens, to avoid incurring any expenses for small hobbyist projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would be a game changer. There are so many times I run out of credits without knowing when it’s going! I know there is the dashboard, but I think it’s quite limited in my use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demo with an inline 8 at 16000 RPM is hard to judge, because I've never heard such an engine IRL. Might I suggest adding demos of engines people know the sound of?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A front-end library that generates 10kb single-html-file artifacts using a Reagent-like API and a ClojureScript-like language. https://github.com/chr15m/eucalypt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Beat Maker, an online drum machine. I'm adding sample uploads now with a content accessible storage API on the server. https://dopeloop.ai/beat-maker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tinkering with Nostr as a decentralized backend for simple web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an API that allows zero-knowledge proofs to be generated in a streaming fashion, meaning ZKPs that use way less RAM than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to let people create ZKPs of any size on any device. ZKPs are very cool but have struggled to gain adoption due to the memory requirements. You usually need to pay for specialized hardware or massive server costs. Hoping to help fix the problem for devs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fwiw: the website is brand new and very much in the "hot garbage" phase of development. I'm not a front-end guy, so critique is welcome from all - especially any bugs in the UX. I'm still actively uncovering them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a tool that lets you create whiteboard explainers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can prompt it with an idea or upload a document and it will create a video with illustrations and voiceover. All the design and animations are done by using AI apis, you dont need any design skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a video explainer of the popular "Attention is all you need" paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really like the idea! One issue though is that the content seems to "stream" much slower than what's being spoken. The result is that I'm sitting there waiting to see whats going to come, even though its already been said which makes it hard to focus on whatever new information is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The animations / drawings themselves are solid too. I think there's more to play with wrt the dimensions and space of the background. It would be nice to see it zoom in and out for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building SPARK (Signal Processing Algorithms, Routines, and Kernels), an open-source library of modular, efficient DSP components for low-power embedded audio systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to make it straightforward to design and deploy small, composable audio graphs that fit on MCUs and similar hardware. The project is in its infancy, so there’s plenty of room for experimentation and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been clumsily exploring the space of what kind of DSP you can do without multipliers, because (in hardware) multiplication is one or two orders of magnitude more expensive than addition; see https://nbviewer.org/url/canonical.org/~kragen/sw/dev3/spars... for one example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Porting a trivia quiz game I wrote 25 years ago from a Java Applet to the modern-day web. Has a scoring mechanism like golf (par-5 harder, par-3 easier, wrong answer choice costs a shot, etc.) Funny how one's code looks the same or different after 25-years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of other things I can't mention for various reasons... hopefully next time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a hexapod, my first robot project ever, harder than I thought. I thought that kinematics will be the hardest thing…currently struggling with Euler Angles, Bezier's Curve and all those wonderful things&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making a game that's inspired by the niche but adored "The Last of Us Factions", the multiplayer as part of the first Last of Us (only available on Playstation). I got a gaming PC a couple years ago and haven't been able to find anything quite like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making it with the Rust game engine, Bevy and really enjoying it so far. Using Blender for making assets. I'm maybe a dumbass for making it as my first game, but I just don't really get excited by smaller projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall I've found modern games to be (1) overstimulating and (2) have algorithms in the background to keep me engaged that I don't trust (see: free to play model)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on rustnet (https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet) which is a cross-platform network monitoring TUI built with Rust that provides real-time visibility into network connections with deep packet inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I'm spending numerous hours trying to package for multiple Linux distributions. I have to say that building for Ubuntu using the Debian build system and Launchpad seems like a way to spend days for nothing except frustration :) Maybe the problem is also me / PEBKAC&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working hard on Rad, which is aiming to be a Bash-replacement for writing CLI scripts. The goal is to allow users to write maintainable scripts with declarative argument parsing, built-in JSON processing, HTTP requests, and interactive prompts - all in a familiar, readable syntax (Python-like!). Here's an example of the declarative approach to script args:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;args: username str # Required string password str? # Optional string token str? # Optional auth token age int # Required integer status str # Required string username requires password // If username is provided, password must also be provided token excludes password // Token and password cannot be used together age range [18, 99] // Inclusive range from 18 to 99 status enum ["active", "inactive", "pending"]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rad does all the arg parsing for you (unlike Bash), including validation for those constraints you wrote, and you can get on with writing the rest of your script is a nice, friendly syntax!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very keen for feedback so if any of that sounds interesting, feel free to give it a go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on improving the data pipeline for https://iplocate.io - an IP intelligence service I've worked on since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent focus has been on geolocation accuracy, and in particular being able to share more data about why we say a resource is in a certain place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of folks seem to be interested in this data, and there's very little out there. Most other industry players don't talk about their methodology, and those that do aren't overly honest about how X or Y strategy actually leads to a given prediction, or the realistic scale or inaccuracies of a given strategy, and so on. So this is an area I'm very interested in at the moment and I'm confident we can do better in. And it's overall a fascinating data challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still rebuilding OnlineOrNot's frontend to be powered by the public REST API. Uptime checks are now fully powered by a public API (still have heartbeat checks, maintenance windows, and status pages to go).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing this both as a means of dogfooding, and adding features to the REST API that I easily dumped into the private GraphQL API without thinking too hard. That, and after I finish the first milestone (uptime checks + heartbeat/cron job monitors), I'll be able to start building a proper terraform provider, and audit logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically at the start of the year I realised GraphQL has taken me as far as it can, and I should've gone with REST to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Botnet of Ares, a hacking simulator game for PC [0]. It's an homage to classics such as Uplink and Hacknet, and also a commentary on the state of the IoT security industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I've managed to port the game onto a real-world cyberdeck, the uConsole. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently building an order queueing and sales recording web app for small coffee shops: SellerMate [https://sellermate.neilvan.com]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Made primarily for my friend's coffee shop. Data is stored locally, and the app is fully functional when offline. There is an optional "syncing" feature to sync your data with multiple devices which requires a sign up. This is a Progressive Web App built with Web Components. The syncing is made possible with PouchDB/CouchDB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still have to write (or screen record) a Getting Started guide but the app is ready for use nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://fooqux.com/ - an experimental tech article aggregator. For several years now, I've had a routine of collecting articles on topics that interest me throughout the week and then reading them over the weekend. To help organize and streamline this process, I created this website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea is to gather tech articles in one place and process them with a LLM — categorize them, generate summaries, and try experimental features like annotations, questions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this service might be useful to others as well. You can sign up with github account to submit your articles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on 1:6 size furniture. There's not much woodworking I can do outside of the shop, so I've been trying to shrink full joinery techniques down to dollhouse size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on several projects at the moment. But I'm deeply invested in with: https://www.aleatoria.chat. It's a random chat site, and I knew from day one that moderation would be the single most difficult challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Server-side analysis using to flag conversations and video feed analysis is in the works... far for being perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The user-driven reporting system has been challenging because I have not find a way to validate the report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am striving for balance... not too strict and also allowing to be spontaneous. It's a fascinating and incredibly difficult problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other learning projects that are not in a shareable state, but help me to focus on something else when I am overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to fix an irritating problem by syncing my work calendar with a personal one, which would allow me to see all my events in my preferred calendar app. This project is still in the very early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main challenge is that our IT department blocks sharing calendars outside of the organisation. While this is primarily a solution for my own problem and likely not valuable to others, you could probably achieve the same result with tools like n8n or IFTTT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- one man project (me) - been doing it well over a year now - no sponsorship, no investors, no backers, no nothing just my passion - I haven't even advertised much, this may first ir second time I'm sharing a link - On a weekdays im building a serious stuff with it - On weekends preparing a new major version with lessons learned from doing a real project with it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not going to stop. But I migh be seeking sponsors in future, not sure how that will turn out. If not that's ok, I'm cool to be only user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a means to get into WebAssembly, I started writing a WebAssembly binary decoder (i.e. a parser for `.wasm` files) from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I started executing the upstream spec tests against it, as a means to increase spec conformance. It's non-streaming, which is a non-starter for many use cases, but I'm hoping to provide a streaming API later down the road. Also, the errors interface are still very much WIP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that said, it's getting close to a fully-conformant one and it's been a really fun project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im building a virtual machine with native ai integration for semantic execution. Its built on top of rust, and you could compile everything you want to it, but it has its own programming language too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Teletable (https://teletable.app), a macOS app that shows live football &amp;amp; F1 standings/results with a teletext interface (think BBC Ceefax). It's free and on the appstore:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work with DSPy in Python and felt it was missing in the Ruby ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I started https://github.com/vicentereig/dspy.rb: a composable, type-safe version built for Rubyists who want to design and optimize prompts, and reuse LLM pipelines without leaving their language of choice. Working with DSPy::Signatures reminds me a bit of designing a db schema with an ORM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s still early, but it already lets you define structured modules, instrument them in Langfuse, wire them up like functional components, and experiment with signature optimization. All in plain Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a platform to help employees prepare for large high-value meetings and presentations with note taking and on-demand AI summarization and sentiment analysis to best prepare and deliver information. The main driver was first-hand experience with expensive team meetings that use time inefficiently and result in "circling back" or "taking it offline" to actually make decisions, which results in information silos and even more inefficient use of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The platform also supports HR for the organization by presenting in-depth anonymized data surrounding team interactions, exceptional individuals, and potential bottlenecks within the organization caused by qualitative issues. Aiming to launch by end of year and working with small businesses as free test users for feedback and validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a TUI for viewing OpenTelemetry traces locally to help me debug distributed applications that use OTEL. It's currently in its infancy, but I'm already able to get a little use out of it. https://github.com/FredrikAugust/otelly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a long running process, and the HW is mostly defined (but not laid out) but on pause while I work on porting TockOS to an ATSAMV71 to make sure I won't run into any project ending issues with the SW before I build the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our waitlist is open for https://flatm8.co.uk - the platform for anonymous reviews of Landlords and Estate Agents in Britain and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re working directly with partner housing unions and charities in Britain and Ireland to build the first central database of rogue landlords and estate agents. Users can search an address and see if it’s marked as rogue/dangerous by the local union, as well as whether you can expect to see your deposit returned, maintenance, communication - etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After renting for close to a decade, it’s the same old problems with no accountability. We wanted to change this, and empower tenants to share their experiences freely and easily with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re launching in November, and I’m very excited to announce our partner organisations! We know this relies on a network effect to work, and we’re hoping to run it as a social venture. I welcome any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d love to know how it went for you and if there’s anything we can learn from your experiences - you’re right that it’s sorely needed! The statistics are getting worse and worse and worse… please feel free to email any thoughts or ideas based on your launch to team @ domain !&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's meant to be a 'rails-like' experience in Go without too much magic and conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, speeding up development of fullstack apps in Go using templ, datastar, sqlc with an MVC architecture and some basic generators to quickly setup models, views and controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on an English learning app. I combine flashcards like Anki with Duolingo-style motivation: leagues and streaks. Plus, integrated Giphy and a Telegram bot. Of course, we use the OpenAI API. Also, as an idea for selecting words to learn, we parse movie subtitles with AI and find cool phrases and words to learn before watching a movie in English (as a second language). The app has Russian translations and UI. My goal is to create the best online dictionary for English learners. We use a crowdsourcing approach where anyone can suggest a cool illustration for any word or phrase and add any word or idiom to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm deploying a biological hardware solution to a regressed masonry event currently blocking ingress to a public channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stoneware bitrot was legacy but eventually overwhelmed the architecture during an off-peak environment incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm tasked with fulfilling runtime dependencies to restore the wall framework, but had issues with build time mixing parameters not compiling well with the piecemeal building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I finally got it up and running through trial and error, though I sense a full rewrite will eventually be needed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a CLI that automatically generates and runs negative and boundary tests from OpenAPI Specs: https://github.com/dochia-dev/dochia-cli. It aims to reduce effort that engineers spent on this type of testing, either automatic or manual. But also making sure it comprehensively covers test scenarios which might not be considered by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m creating an electronic avionics sensor and display for experimental aircraft. I’m having a fantastic time learning about circuits and MCUs (I have a pure CS degree, zero background with EE stuff). I’ve been working on this in my off hours for over a year now, maybe someday it will be a product that people buy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current challenge is the display. I’ve struggled to learn about this part more than any other. After studying DVI and LVDS, and after trying to figure out what MIPI/DSI is all about, I think parallel RGB is the path forward, so I’ve just designed a test PCB for that, and ordered it from JLCPCB’s PCBA service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, an explorable database of movies, TV shows, books and board games organised around the time and place that they're set. So if you're interested in stuff set during the French Revolution but not in Paris, you could find it there, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://check.supply: the easiest way to mail a real paper check from your iPhone. Link your bank, type the amount, and we print + mail it for you — with optional certified or express USPS tracking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built this same thing about 15-20 years ago, there was no plaid so I just had them input their routing and account info, I could print anything I wanted on the MICR line so I don't see why you need access to a user's bank account (seems intrusive to me). Also, at that time, I had trouble getting people to pay me even enough to cover postage so bravo to you if you have people paying you $7/check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a design system. I'm a software eng not a designer, but I started one a long while back because I wanted to get a sense of what designers go through. I've dropped it and came back a half dozen times but now I'm finishing it up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been a great project to understand how design depends on a consistent narrative and purpose. At first I put together elements I thought looked good but nothing seemed to "work" and it's only when I took a step back and considered what the purpose and philosophy of the design was that it started to feel cohesive and intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll never be a designer but I often do side projects outside my wheelhouse so I can build empathy for my teammates and better speak their language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice, I can see the appeal having familiar UI on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I am not your target audience (linux i3 user myself), I would be interested in knowing how much "hacking" the macOS system is required to do this. Is it hard to get a list of running apps for your Task Bar? Is it hard to list the apps for the menu? How about keeping it all "on top" while other windows e.g. get maximized/minimized/full-screen, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could talk for days on all the peculiar bugs resolved. Once the alpha stabilizes I have drafts to publish on several topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You actually nailed the major pain points. Particularly window focus and state management. I've spent months solving this problem alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Applications data list: Getting the list is easy! Finding out which apps in that list are "real" apps isn't. Getting icons isn't. Reliably getting information on app state isn't. Finding out why something doesn't work right is as painful as can be. Doing all this in a performant way is a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Applications menu renderer: Rendering the list for the menu is easy enough: the macOS app sends this data via socket. The frontend is just web sockets and web components under the hood (https://lit.dev). The difficult part was converting app icons to PNG, which is awfully slow. So a cache-warmup stage on startup finds all apps, converts their icons to png, and caches them to the app directory for read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Window state: again, by far the worst and it isn't even close. Bugs galore. The biggest issue was overriding macOS core behavior on what a window is, when it's focused, and how to communicate its events reliably to the app. Although I did include a couple private APIs to achieve this, you can get pretty far by overriding Window class types in ways that I don't think were intended (lol). There is trickery required for the app to behave correctly: and the app is deceptively simple at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One bug, and realization, that still makes me chuckle today.. anything can be a window in macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm writing this on Firefox now, and if I hover over a tab and a tooltip pops up - that's a window. So a fair amount of time has gone into determining _what_ these apps are doing and why. Then coming up with rules on determining when a window is likely to be a "real" window or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Accessibility Inspector app comes standard on macOS and was helpful for debugging this, but it was a pain regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm attempting to work on a "spiritual successor" to Dramatica Story Expert, a crazy story theory/brainstorming program of days gone by. Technically, Dramatica is still around, but they never made a 64-bit version for Macs, and both the Mac and Windows version have been tenaciously clinging to the trailing edge of technology for decades. (The Mac version somehow never got retina fonts. I'm not sure how you even do that.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started my program in Swift and SwiftUI, although for various reasons I'm starting to look at Dart and Flutter (in part because being multiplatform would be beneficial, and in part because I am getting the distinct feeling this program is more ambitious than where SwiftUI is at currently). It isn't a direct port of Dramatica by any stretch, instead drawing on what I've learned writing my own novels, getting taught by master fiction writers, and being part of writing workshops. But no other program that I've seen uses Dramatica's neatest concepts, other than Subtxt, a web-based, AI-focused app which has recently been anointed Dramatica's official successor. (It's a neat concept, but it's very expensive compared to the original Dramatica or any other extant "fiction plotting" program. Also, there's a space for non-AI software here, I suspect: there are a lot of creatives who are adamantly opposed to it in any form whatsoever.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently my biggest focus is my MUD Server I'm working on. Allows a developer to create a simple MUD game, (locations, items, combat), but all NPCs are actually just LLM controlled MUD clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uses Server-Sent Events for the client + HTTP post for sending actions. Not a traditional direct TELNET style MUD server, but works well in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitely not 100% hand-coded, probably only around 30% at this point, as I've had my original code refactored and expanded many times by now. It's taught me a lot about managing the agent in agentic-coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm pretty interested in following the progress of your MUD server, if you have any way for me to do that. I was a heavy player back the day, mostly Circle/Diku MUDs, and still try one out from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lately, I have been considering creating my own as a "something to do in my downtime" project, using Coffee or Evennia, but if you're creating a full server environment that makes rolling out a playable world more convenient, sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having migraines on and off the past few months, I wanted a way to try and narrow down triggers. All the existing apps out there were overly complicated. So I built something simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an iOS app to help tracking events and stats about my day as simple dots. How many cups of coffee? Did I take my supplements? How did I sleep? Did I have a migraine? Think of it like a digital bullet journal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then visualizing all those dots together helps me see patterns and correlations. It’s helped me cut down my occurrence of migraines significantly. I’m still just in the public beta phase but looking forward to a full release fairly soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear more feedback on how to improve the app!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great! I can see this useful across a variety of self-assessment things: - I’m tired often, are there certain patterns that align with that? - I’m feeling anxious, what events in a day (or other inputs) align with that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last months I've been making a songbook with chordpro https://www.chordpro.org/, amazing CLI program that produces a PDF from text files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on my own arrangements, putting chords in lyrics, and the program produces a page with the chord diagrams next to each song. ChordPro is a program that descends from a long lineage of programs that do this, but it's been actively under development in the last 3-4 years. The developer is quite nice, and attends bug reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one's going to be out of left field, but last Thursday I launched Countdown Treasure (https://countdowntreasure.com)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a real life treasure hunt in the Blue Ridge Mountains with a current total prize of $31,200+ in gold coins and a growing side pot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I modeled it off of last year's Project Skydrop (https://projectskydrop.com) which was in the Boston area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Shrinking search area (today, Day 5, it will be 160 miles, on Day 21 it'll be just 1 foot wide)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* 24/7 webcam trained on the jar of gold coins sitting on the forest floor just off a public hiking trail&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Premium upgrades ($10 from each upgrade goes towards the side pot) for aerial photos above the treasure and access to a private online community (and you get your daily clues earlier)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* $2 from each upgrade goes towards the goal of raising $20k for continued Hurricane Helene relief&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far the side pot is $6k and climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been such a fun project to work on, but also a lot of work. Tons of moving parts and checking twice and three times to make sure you've scrubbed all the EXIF data, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! Yeah, I unfortunately can't shell out a straight $20k donation, but I saved the $25k over the year from my e-commerce business and justified it as a marketing expense if worse case scenario happens and it's found earlier than the math predicts. But if we get past break even then can't wait to write that check to help out the communities around here that are still recovering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe some? But the circle today will be 160 miles wide or about the same width as Switzerland and Denmark. So I'm not sure how much shadows would help you pinpoint a specific location in an entire country worth of mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a tool called Materia[0] for managing Podman Quadlets on hosts; I released a new version last month (and posted it on the September thread) and just merged automatic volume data migration the other day. Next goal is to design a system for downloading and loading remote components, similar to ansible roles. Hopefully I can tie it into the new podman quadlet install/etc commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A general utility library in C99, that I reuse throughout my different projects! Atm working on the json module and some f32 linear algebra https://github.com/romainaugier/libromano&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always learned programming and maths on my own so any advice is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on my favicon fetching API: https://fetchfavicon.com. Currently adding comparison pages with other services. Also learning a lot of SEO and video editing for https://soulfulsabor.com, a food blog that I started with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a VsCode extension for drone coding. So you can easily write code to control a fleet of drones, deploy ai model and even setup training of new Reinforcement Learning models for drone behavior https://tensorfleet.net&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collecting public datasets for training visual AI models to track and target drones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drones are real bastards - there's a lot of startups working on anti drone systems and interceptors, but most of them are using synthetic data. The data I'm collecting is designed to augment the synthetic data, so anti drone systems are closer to field testing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still working on turning a wishlist app that I built for my friends into a real product — it’s called https://thingstohave.app. I wrote a comment about it in summer, and these are the updates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. I shared the app with the small audience I have and received some feedback in very unexpected places. First, it was hard to understand how lists work because putting things into lists was an unobvious process. I fixed that by adding DnD that works well both with mouse and touch (turned out it’s two separate APIs). Second, users thought that the screenshot on the quite minimal landing page was the real app, and they clicked on it. The problem was so frequent and surprising that I decided to add something funny for people who do that, as I’m not willing to contribute a lot of time to the landing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. I underestimated how bad discoverability on the internet is. My expectation was that I would make my site fully server-side rendered, add a basic sitemap to Search Console, and have a few dozen organic users during the pre-holiday season when users are filling their wishlists. In reality, I got zero — not even users, but even visits. So I started actually working on SEO, no black magic but just adding slightly more complex sitemaps, micro-markup, and other stuff which I thought only products competing for the first page would need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My next steps are to work on getting some minimal organic inflow of users and improving stuff related to auth and user management, which is the most time-consuming part of the work right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think app icons are an underrated artistic format, but they’ve only been used for product logos. I made 001 to explore the idea of turning them into an open-ended creative canvas. There are 99 “exhibit spaces” in the gallery, and artists can claim an exhibit to install art within. Visitors purchase limited-edition copies of pieces to display as the app’s icon, the art’s native format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a real-money marketplace too - the app makes money by taking commission of sales (Not crypto). I like economic simulation games and I think the constraints here could be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m currently looking for artists to exhibit in the gallery, if anyone is interested, or knows someone who may be, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's working well and I think I can use the same "backend" to pull this data into a spreadsheet which could be useful for data hungry users/coaches/club and event organizers/etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data hungry users/coaches probably already use something like TrainingPeaks[1], which has the more advanced features that you seem to want out of Strava. Might be worthwhile to check out if you're looking for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on Maudit, a Rust library to make static websites. Emphasis on library instead of framework. I aim that you could integrate Maudit into existing Rust apps, building pages individually, rendering Markdown where you need etc, instead of a black box magic "build website" command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built https://invoicepad.app which is a free, completely in-browser tool for creating invoices, estimates, and quotes. Yes, similar apps have been posted here before, but none were built the way I envisioned, so I made my own. The key difference: all invoice data is stored in the URL hash, not the querystring. This is important because querystrings are sent to the server with every request, while hashes stay local to your browser. This means I can never see your invoice data, unlike other similar apps. The workflow is simple: use your browser's bookmark manager as your invoice filing system. Or if you want to keep it offline, just copy and paste invoice URLs into a text document for storage. I’ve also included helpful features like saved profiles to save on repeated data input. The next step is to finish working on a browser extension (v1 is being tested) to make bookmarking, editing, and saving changes even easier, that is if I ever stop being distracted by other side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working to build some tools for detecting and monitoring lookalike domains - the kinds of things used in phishing / brand impersonation attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current prototype scans potential lookalikes for a target domain and then tracks DNS footprint over time. It's early, but functional - and makes it easier to understand if some lookalike domain is looking more "threat-y".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also been working on automating the processing of a parent-survey response for my kid's school using LLMs. The goal is to produce consistent summarization and statistics across multiple years and provide families with a clearer voice and helping staff and leadership at the school best understand what things have been working well (and where the school could improve).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still slowly working away on my location intelligence data union..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a while understanding what sort of market would make it viable. I think it does actually work if you can square: 10K participants per major metro area, revenue of about 2.9M per metro area (so say, 5K monthly recurring with about 50 customers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point you could pay data union participants about $5 a week to share their location data with you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From talking to some previous data union folks, the major challenges are paying out (my target is much higher than any union managed), and people dropping out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My bet is that these are both solvable things by selling data products rather than just bundles of data, and the data source being very passive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also interested in the idea that such a union should act more like a union than previous efforts in this space, by actively defending members’ data from brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Veila, a privacy‑first AI chat service. I wanted something that prevents model providers from profiling users and linking information from chats to their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a robotics engineer by training, this is my first public launch of a web app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- What it is: - Anonymous AI chat via a privacy proxy (provider sees our server, not your IP or account info) - End‑to‑end encrypted history, keys derived from password and never leave your device - Pay‑as‑you‑go; switch models mid‑chat (OpenAI now; Claude, Gemini and others planned) - Practical UX: sort chats into folders, Markdown, copyable code blocks, mobile‑friendly - Notes/limits: - Not self‑hosted: prompts go to third‑party APIs - If you include identifying info, upstream sees it - Prompts take a bit long sometimes, because reasoning is set to "medium" for now. Plan to make this adjustable in the future. - Looking for feedback: - What do you need to trust this? Open source? Independent audit? - Gaps in the threat model I'm missing - Which UI features and AI models you'd want next - Any UX rough edges (esp. mobile) - Learn more: - Compare Veila to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. (best viewed on desktop): https://veila.ai/docs/compare.html - Discord: https://discord.gg/RcrbZ25ytb - More background: https://veila.ai/about.html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm. I can't say for others, but I can tell you what would work for me given that I might meet some the criteria of desired audience for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this space, it is more about trust and what you have done in the past more than anything else. Audits and whatnot are nice, but I need to be able to trust that your decisions will be sound. Think how Steam's Gabe gained his reputation. Not exactly easy feat these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing this! Fully agree that trust is key, normally being on the user side of privacy-focussed services myself. Open source can help build this trust, but it would be ideal to have a way to make what is actually running on and being served by the servers transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd love to hear your feedback if you get around to test Veila, e.g. on hey@veila.ai.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a platform to help user to enrich their data by AI. so that AI can understand their Data more, especially for ChatGPT. Also it's easy to host a data and publish a MCP for ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge is how ChatGPT can understand your "query" or say "prompts"? Raw data is not good enough - so I try to use a term called "AI Understanding Score" to measure it: https://senify.ai/ai-understanding-score. I think this index will help user to build more context so that AI can know more and answer with correct result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very early work without every detail considered, really would like to have your feedback and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I built a simple athlete profile page for my son (Track sprinting) to log his performance and progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He liked what I built for him and I got jealous, so I expanded it with my own profile (Trail running).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, I got curious… Could I build a full web platform for people to track their sporting life? I mean we have LinkedIn and CVs for our job career, why not celebrate all our sports/training efforts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a couple of months on the side, I'm pretty happy with Flexbase. If you're into sports, give it a try and let me know what's missing for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can list the sports you're doing or did in your entire life, you can add your PRs, training routines, gear, competition results, photos. You can also list your clubs, and invite/follow your training buddies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I'm not sure where (or if) to expand it... Turn it into a Club-centric tool, make it more into a social network for sporty people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of ideas, but I'd love to find someone to work on it with me. I find that building alone is less fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past 2 months I've building an app called LogBuddy. I've recently completed the MVP and it helps me track my weight, my workout sessions, my food intake, and my periods, all in one app. It's really basic on purpose. This app also gave me the opportunity to go all in on mobile dev with Ionic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm putting a bunch of security tools / data feeds together as a service. The goal is to help teams and individuals run scans/analysis/security project management for "freemium" (certain number of scans/projects for free each month, haven't locked in on how it'll pan out fully $$ wise).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to help lower the technical hurdles to running and maintaining security tools for teams and individuals. There are a ton of great open source tools out there, most people either don't know or don't have the time to do a technical deep dive into each. So I'm adding utilities and tools by the day to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, there's a built in expert platform for you to get help on your security problems built into the system. (Currently an expert team consisting of [me]). Longer term, I'm working on some AI plugins to help alert on CVEs custom to you, generate automated scans, and some other fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I help privacy and data sovereignty enthusiasts take back control of their data without needing to change their habits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working for the past 3 years on SelfHostBlocks https://github.com/ibizaman/selfhostblocks, making self-hosting a viable and convenient alternative to the cloud for non technical people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is based on NixOS and provides a hand-picked groupware stack: user-facing there is Vaultwarden and Nextcloud (and a bunch more but those 2 are the most important IMO for non technical people as it covers most of one’s important data) and on the backend Authelia, LLDAP, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Grafana and some more. My know-how is in how to configure all this so they play nice together and to have backups, SSO, LDAP, reverse proxy, etc. integration. I’m using it daily as the house server, I’m my first customer after all. And beginning of 2025 it passed my own internal checkpoint to be shared with others and there’s a handful of technical users using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal is to work on this full time. I started a company to provide a white glove installation, configuration and maintenance of a server with SelfHostBlocks. Everything I’ll be doing will always be open source, same as the whole stack and the server is DIY and repair friendly. The continuous maintenance is provided with a subscription which includes customer support and training on the software stack as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a small side-project focused on React Native apps to manage their version update and maintenance mode. - https://appcockpit.dev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I am getting my first users and already getting great feedback. Many things on the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always eager to learn more about others pain points when it comes to React Native/mobile development. Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having worked for different startups for 10+ years and started 3 of my own (eventually failing), I always wanted a job board for local startups. Not necessarily IT-related jobs. Finally built it about a month ago: https://estonianstartupjobs.ee&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are few similar projects too, one is itself a startup which sadly on the verge of bankruptcy, and another aggregates only IT-related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building Skim: https://www.justskim.in/, A PWA that lets you read books as auto-swiping, short-form content on mobile. I use it to replace watching YouTube Shorts or Instagram with reading in the same form factor. It works offline and is entirely client-side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This weekend I’m working on making the parsing more robust. The most common friction I’ve heard is that downloading books elsewhere and importing them into the app is distracting. I’m torn between expanding it to include a peer-to-peer book exchange or turning it into an RSS feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been reversing Sound Blaster Command so that I could control my external DAC/AMP without Windows. So far I can change the LED color and EQ presets, which was the main reason I wanted to do it in the first place. I am currently in the process of writing a GUI for it so that others can use it too (I only tested it with 1 soundcard, G6, though) for their older soundblaster cards that are not supported by Creative's multiplatform solutions. Will use Clay for it. Initially wanted to use Qt but I wrote the implementation in C and now I am too lazy to adapt it to cpp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been hacking on improving its linear algebra support (as that's one of the key focuses I want - native matrix/vector types and easy math with them), which has also helped flush out a bunch of codegen bugs. When that gets tedious, I've also been working on general syntax ergonomics and fixing correctness bugs, with a view to self-hosting in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Tailstream (https://tailstream.io/), turning logs into task time visual data streams. Built the web application, web site and a Go CLI agent (open source) and am now slightly pivoting into making it more log-focused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on faceted search for logs and CLI client now and trying to share my progress on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding new transports and documentation to my Typescript logging library (MIT licensed), LogLayer (https://loglayer.dev). Just added documentation for Bun and Deno support added some new logging library transports (LogTape), and finishing up Logflare and Betterstack transports so you can send logs to their logging APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve got a side project going that’s a browser extension (starting with Safari + Sign in with Apple) intended to add a comment layer to the internet as a whole. I’m calling it Chaffiti (https://chaffiti.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to enable a comment section on any webpage, right as you’re browsing. Viewing a Zillow listing? See what people are excited about with the property. Wonder what people think about a tourist attraction? It’ll be right there. Want to leave your referral or promo code on a checkout page for others? Post it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure what the business model will look like just yet. Just the kind of thing I wish existed compared to needing to venture out to a third party (traditional social media / forums etc) to see others’ thoughts on something I’m viewing online. I welcome any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great idea but wouldn’t you run into storage issues pretty quickly without massive budget for large database clusters? The web is a big and constantly changing place. Covering it in useful comments seems prohibitively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on DB Pro — a modern desktop database workbench built with Electron, React, and Drizzle ORM. It’s designed to feel fast, cohesive, and genuinely enjoyable to use — something that sits somewhere between TablePlus, Notion, and VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now it connects to local and remote databases like SQLite and Postgres, lets you browse schemas and tables instantly, edit data inline, and create or modify tables visually. You can save and run queries, generate SQL using AI, and import or export data as CSV or JSON. There’s also a fully offline local mode that works great for prototyping and development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the more unique aspects is that DB Pro lets you download and run a local LLM for AI-assisted querying, so nothing ever leaves your machine. You can also plug in your own cloud API key if you prefer. The idea is to make AI genuinely useful in a database context — helping you explore data and write queries safely, not replacing you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next big feature is a Visual Query Builder with JOIN support that keeps the Visual, SQL, and AI modes in sync. After that, I’m working on dashboards, workflow automation, and team collaboration — things like running scripts when data changes or sharing queries across a workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to make DB Pro the most intuitive way to explore, query, and manage data — without the usual enterprise clutter. It’s still early, but it’s already feeling like the tool I always wanted to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear feedback, especially from people who spend a lot of time in database clients — what’s still missing or frustrating in the current landscape?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on MAKID as a solo side project the last few years. It’s an Ableton Live project manager that seamlessly integrates with your file system. http://makidapp.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial institutions and governments don’t spot crime because of incomplete information at individual firms. We help them understand federated learning and how to effectively collaborate and not just talk about it. All code is open source, so you can always help out ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made https://www.copy.directory/ a few years back, now thinking about adding more features. It helps copywriters find just the exact word they need for their job. 0 AI features in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My team and I are building tools to streamline business processes and help businesses work faster, smarter, and more securely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently we have two tools that are already being used by different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is the Flowmono E-Sign tool; you can sign and send documents securely from anywhere, without printing or scanning, and it is relatively cheaper than any other E-sign platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with Flowmono Workflow Automate, you can connect your tools and set up smart workflows that handle repetitive tasks for you, saving time and keeping your processes running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a DnD character sheet app! I spent last week implementing the core DnD SRD ruleset, but what I'm really excited about is ML integration. I want to add a self-hosted fine-tuned ML model that acts as a character and DM assistant. Obviously an LLM via API can do the job, but I'm really curious if it's possible to build smaller, cheaper, task-specific models. Plus, I've never integrated an ML model into a product before, and I'm curious to play with it. I'm thinking of it like clippy for DnD: "it looks like you're trying to cast fireball?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides the LLM experimentation, this project has allowed me to dive into interesting new tech stacks. I'm working in Hono on Bun, writing server-side components in JSX and then updating the UI via htmx. I'm really happy with how it's coming together so far!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An experimental mesh network protocol, that is still very much pre alpha and missing some features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big thing I wanted to try is automatic global routing via MQTT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything is globally routable. You can roam around between gateway nodes, as long as all the gateways are on the same MQTT server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there's a JavaScript implementation that connects directly to MQTT. So you can make a sensor, go to the web app, type the sensor's channel key, and see the data, without needing to create any accounts or activate or provision anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Lunch Flow (https://lunchflow.app), a tool that allows people to automatically sync their bank accounts to their favorite budgeting apps (Google Sheets, Lunch Money, Actual Budget, or use our API!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was motivated to build this as I found that many great personal finance and budget apps didn't offer integrations with the banks I used, which is understandable given the complexity and costs involved, so I wanted to tackle this problem and help build the missing open banking layer for personal finance apps, with very low costs (a few dollars a month) and a very simple api, or built-in integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on making this sustainable, but been quite a learning experience so far, and quite excited to see it already making a difference for so many people :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• implemented adaptive quadrature with Newton–Cotes formulas&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• wrote a tiny Markov-chain text generator&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• prototyped an interactive pipeline system for non-normalized relational data in Lua by abusing operator overloading&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• load-tested and taste-tested primary batteries at loads exceeding those in the datasheet; numerically simulated a programmable load circuit for automating the load testing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• measured the frequency of subroutine calls and leaf subroutine calls in several programs with Valgrind&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• wrote a completely unhealthy quantity of commentary on HN&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New ideas I'm thinking about include backward-compatible representations of soft newlines in plain ASCII text, multitouch calculators supporting programming by demonstration, virtual machines for perfectly reproducible computations, TCES energy storage for household applications beyond climate control such as cooking and laundry, canceling the harmonic poles of recursive comb filters with zeroes in the nonrecursive combs of a Hogenauer filter, differential planetary transmissions for compact extreme reductions similar to a cycloidal drive, rapid ECM punching in aluminum foil, air levigation of grog, ultra-cheap passive solar thermal collectors, etc. Happy to go into more detail if any of these sound interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got tired of trying to find a good MP3 player that just worked so I created a website to function as an online MP3 player. I started adding sources for content and ended up supporting YouTube, Spotify, Twitch, Instagram, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Rumble, WSHH, Facebook and X. So now you can create playlists from all of those sources with features you would find on any decent MP3 player such as loop, repeat, etc. I also drew inspiration from YTInstant and created a real time search for content that allows you to type lyrics and song titles and it will instantly find your content. Finally, I said well while I'm at it, I might as well just recreate MySpace, so I did that too. Let me know your thoughts. https://plasas.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* LLMs are accessible where telegram is accessible&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Multitude of models to choose from (chatgpt, claude, gemini) and more is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Full control over the bot behaviour is in user's hands: I don't add any system messages or temperature/top_p. I give UI for full control over system messages, temperature, top_p, thinking, web searching/scrapping and more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Q/A like context handling. Context is not carried through the whole bot, it's rather carried through chaing of replies. Naturally could be branched or use various models cross messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my hobby project and one of main tools for working with LLMs, thus I'm going to stick to it for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fun, playing with Meshtastic https://meshtastic.org/ and contributing to the open source firmware and apps. They have something cool but need lots of help. I've patched 3 memory leaks and had a few other PRs merged already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For work, https://heyoncall.com/ as the best tool for on-call alerting, website monitoring, cron job monitoring, especially for small teams and solo founders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess they both fall under the category of "how do you build reliable systems out of unreliable distributed components" :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on two passions of mine. Both of them a one-man project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is a DNS blocker called Quietnet - https://quietnet.app. Its born out of my interest in infrastructure and I wanted to build an opininated DNS blocker that helps mom and pops be safer on the Internet. At the end of the day its just the typical Pi-hole on the Cloud but with my personal interest in providing stronger privacy for our users while keeping their families safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second, is a small newsletter aggregator tool called Newsletters.love - https://newsletters.love/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to create a way for people to start curating their own list of newsletters and then sharing them with their friends and families. The service helps to generate a private email adddress that they can use to subscribe to newsletters and then start reading those newsletters whenever they want without it getting lost in their email inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM/procedurally-generated fictional wikis with worldbuilding history/context so the wiki stays coherent. Fun project to make the most of LLM hallucinations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm fiddling with index optimizations for the Marginalia Search index software, with being able to add ad-hoc domain filters in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure if there's more to say about it right now except that fuzz tests are good for this sort of low level programming with disk layouts involved. They drive up test execution time, but it's still almost hard to build them too early or have too many of them, as there's almost always an unimaginable number of permutations of weird corner cases that are hard to get at with regards to block boundaries and so on that are hard to identify based on staring at the code and doing classic unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://fileboost.dev –– A Ruby on Rails Active Storage plugin that is a plug and play gem for image transformation without making any code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being a Ruby on Rails consultant, I frequently see active storage transformation becoming a bottleneck for web servers by eating up resources and making them sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built Fileboost to solve this problem for my customers. I'd love any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The glamourous world of data testing! A lightweight flexible data contracts library called Wimsey[0].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main pitch is you have minimal dependencies and overheads and can run tests natively on pandas/polars/pyspark/dask/duckdb/etc (thanks to the awesome Narwhals project)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's mostly there for v1 right now, but kean to add a tiny bit more functionality, and well a lot more docs. Working on something that's automated alongside the test suite, which should keep things reliable and fresh (I'll find out soon enough)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re working on Fibre - secure file uploads for Intercom/Crisp, and uploads sent straight to your storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed a gap - our customers are required to upload sensitive documents but often hesitate at the thought of uploading documents in the intercom/crisp interface, citing privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought, how difficult would it be to build an app that sends documents to your own Google drive - turns out it’s very easy. In a week, we built an app that renders an iframe in the intercom chat interface and sends documents straight to our google drive folder, bypassing intercom all together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re now investigating uploading to s3 or azure blob storage and generating summaries of documents that are sent to the intercom conversation thread so ops teams can triage quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Getting into RTL SDR, ordered a dongle, should be fun, want to build a grid people can plug into&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;- Moving BrowserBox to a binary release distribution channel for IP enforcement and ease of installation. Public repo will no longer be updated except for docs/version/base install script, and all dev happens in internal with binaries released to https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox. Too many "companies" (even "legit", large ones) abusing ancient forks and stealing our commercial updates without license, or violating previous permissive's conditions like AGPL source provision. Business lesson is even commercial licensed source-available eats into sales pipeline due to violators who could pay but assume false impunity and steal "freebies" "because they can." No perfect protection, but from now enforcement will ramp up, and source access is only for minimum ACV customers as add-on. So many enhancements coming down the pipe so it's gonna be many improved versions from here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Creating an improved keyboard for iOS swipe typing, I don't like the settings or word choices in ambiguity and think it can be better&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's basically a reverse-proxy-as-a-service. I handle TLS termination and cert management, offer routing rules, rate limiting, WAF + DDOS protection, proxy + web analytics, redirects etc. All accessible via very simple API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Underneath it's Caddy hosted on AWS for proxy fleets, and Heroku for Web + API fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you zoom out it's meant to look something like a thermal vent with cellular life. Rank and karma cause the cells to bio-illuminate. Each cell is a submission, each organelle is a comment thread, and every shape represents a live connection to the Firebase HN API. It also has features to search, filter, and go back in time as far as the backend has been running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been a passion project of mine. My little Temple OS. And I'll keep adding little features that please me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that a lot of work is duplicated across projects that use the same libraries or SDKs (e.g., Stripe). Developers write a lot of glue code to shuffle data between the Stripe API and the app’s frontend or admin dashboard, as well as to handle incoming webhooks and persist data to the app’s database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why I’ve been building 'Fragno', a framework for creating full-stack libraries. It allows library authors to define backend routes and provides reactive primitives for building frontend logic around those routes. All of this integrates seamlessly into the user’s application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this approach, providers like Stripe can greatly improve the developer experience and integration speed for their users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically the title explains it, I challenged myself to making a chrome extension a day for a month. I've been posting my progress on reddit, and my first two extensions have just been accepted to the chrome store (I'm only done day 3 so far, those were quick reviews!). For those interested:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 1: Minimal Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 2: No Google AI Overview in Google Search&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day 3: No Images Reddit (Not Published, yet!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm posting daily, I would love to hear thoughts on the extensions!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a compiler for WebAssembly. The idea is you use the raw wasm instructions like you’d use JSX in React, so you can make reusable components and compose them into higher abstractions. Inlining is just a function call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s implemented in Elixir and uses its powerful macro system. This is paired with a philosophy of static &amp;amp; bump allocation, so I’m trying to find a happy medium of simplicity with a powerful-enough paradigm yet generate simple, compact code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m currently building YTVidHub—a tool that focuses on solving a very specific, repetitive workflow pain for researchers and content analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pain Point: If you are analyzing a large YouTube channel (e.g., for language study, competitive analysis, or data modeling), you often need the subtitle files for 50, 100, or more videos. The current process is agonizing: copy-paste URL, click, download, repeat dozens of times. It's a massive time sink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Solution: YTVidHub is designed around bulk processing. The core feature is a clean interface where you can paste dozens of YouTube URLs at once, and the system intelligently extracts all available subtitles (including auto-generated ones) and packages them into a single, organized ZIP file for one-click download.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target Users: Academic researchers needing data sets, content creators doing competitive keyword analysis, and language learners building large vocabulary corpora.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture challenge right now is optimizing the backend queuing system for high-volume, concurrent requests to ensure we can handle large batches quickly and reliably without hitting rate limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's still pre-launch, but I'd love any feedback on this specific problem space. Is this a pain point you've encountered? What's your current workaround?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How coincidental - I needed exactly this just a couple days ago. I ended up vibecoding a script to feed an individual URL into yt-dlp then pipe the downloaded audio through Whisper - not quite the same thing as it's not downloading the _actual_ subtitles but rather generating its own transcription, but similar. I've only run it on a single video to test, but it seemed to work satisfactorily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't upgraded to bulk processing yet, but I imagine I'd look for some API to get "all URLs for a channel" and then process them in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is some fantastic validation, thank you! It’s cool to hear you already vibecoded a solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've basically hit on the two main challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transcription Quality vs. Official Subtitles: The Whisper approach is brilliant for videos without captions, but the downside is potential errors, especially with specialized terminology. YTVidHub's core differentiator is leveraging the official (manual or auto-generated) captions provided by YouTube. When accuracy is crucial (like for research), getting that clean, time-synced file is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bulk Challenge (Channel/Playlist Harvesting): You're spot on. We were just discussing that getting a full list of URLs for a channel is the biggest hurdle against API limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You actually mentioned the perfect workaround! We tap into that exact yt-dlp capability—passing the channel or playlist link to internally get all the video IDs. That's the most reliable way to create a large batch request. We then take that list of IDs and feed them into our own optimized, parallel extraction system to pull the subtitles only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's tricky to keep that pipeline stable against YouTube’s front-end changes, but using that list/channel parsing capability is definitely the right architectural starting point for handling bulk requests gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quick question for you: For your analysis, is the SRT timestamp structure important (e.g., for aligning data), or would a plain TXT file suffice? We're optimizing the output options now and your use case is highly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good luck with your script development! Let me know if you run into any other interesting architectural issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've built something similar before for my own use cases and one thing I'd push back on are official subtitles. Basically no video I care about has ever had "official" subtitles and the auto generated subtitles are significantly worse than what you get by piping content through an LLM. I used Gemini because it was the cheapest option and still did very well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge with this approach is that you probably need to pass extra context to LLMs depending on the content. If you are researching a niche topic, there will be lots of mistakes if the audio isn't if high quality because that knowledge isn't in the LLM weights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another challenge is that I often wanted to extract content from live streams, but they are very long with lots of pauses, so I needed to do some cutting and processing on the audio clips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the app I built I would feed an RSS feed of video subscriptions in, and at the other end a fully built website with summaries, analysis, and transcriptions comes out that is automatically updated based on the youtube subscription rss feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is amazing feedback, thanks for sharing your deep experience with this problem space. You've clearly pushed past the 'download' step into true content analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've raised two absolutely critical architectural points that we're wrestling with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Official Subtitles vs. LLM Transcription: You are 100% correct about auto-generated subs being junk. We view official subtitles as the "trusted baseline" when available (especially for major educational channels), but your experience with Gemini confirms that an optimized LLM-based transcription module is non-negotiable for niche, high-value content. We're planning to introduce an optional, higher-accuracy LLM-powered transcription feature to handle those cases where the official subs don't exist, specifically addressing the need to inject custom context (e.g., topic keywords) to improve accuracy on technical jargon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Automation Pipeline (RSS/RAG): This is the future. Your RSS-to-Website pipeline is exactly what turns a utility into a Research Engine. We want YTVidHub to be the first mile of that process. The challenges you mentioned—pre-processing long live stream audio—is exactly why our parallel processing architecture needs to be robust enough to handle the audio extraction and cleaning before the LLM call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd be genuinely interested in learning more about your approach to pre-processing the live stream audio to remove pauses and dead air—that’s a huge performance bottleneck we’re trying to optimize. Any high-level insights you can share would be highly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the long videos I just relied in ffmpeg to remove silence. It has lots of options for it, but you may need to fiddle with the parameters to make it work. I ended up with something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did consider building a tool like this before I pivot to something else. I'm learning materials in Chinese Mandarin language from a YouTube playlist. NotebookLLM doesn't support Chinese language yet so you must make sure your app supports Chinese Mandarin so I can use it. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A way to find specific materials would be nice. Think of converting the whole playlist into something like RAG then you can search anything from this playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, thanks for this validation! Hearing from someone who almost built the solution themselves confirms we’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You hit the nail on the head regarding language support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mandarin/Multilingual Support: Absolutely, supporting a wide range of languages—especially Mandarin—is a top priority. Since we focus on extracting the official subtitles provided by YouTube, the language support is inherently tied to what the YouTube platform offers. We just need to ensure our system correctly parses and handles those specific Unicode character sets on the backend. We'll make sure CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) languages are handled cleanly from Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RAG/Semantic Search Idea: That is an excellent feature suggestion and exactly where I see the tool evolving! Instead of just giving the user a zip file of raw data, the true value is transforming that data into a searchable corpus. The idea of using RAG to search across an entire playlist/channel transcript is something we're actively exploring as a roadmap feature, turning the tool from a downloader into a Research Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the use case and the specific requirements! It helps us prioritize the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Since we focus on extracting the official subtitles provided by YouTube, the language support is inherently tied to what the YouTube platform offers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use video understanding from Gemini LLM models to extract subtitles even the video doesn't have official subtitles. That's expensive for sure. But you should provide this option to willing users. I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is a fantastic point, and you've perfectly articulated the core trade-off we're facing: Accuracy vs. Cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are 100% right. For the serious user (researcher, data analyst, etc.) the lack of an official subtitle is a non-starter. Relying solely on official captions severely limits the available corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The suggestion to use powerful models like Gemini for high-accuracy, custom transcription is excellent, but as you noted, the costs can spiral quickly, especially with bulk processing of long videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is where we are leaning for the business model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are committed to keeping the Bulk Download of all YouTube-provided subtitles free, but we must implement a fair-use limit on the number of requests per user to manage the substantial bandwidth and processing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We plan to introduce a "Pro Transcription" tier for those high-value, high-volume use cases. This premium tier would cover:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlimited/High-Volume Bulk Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLM-Powered Transcription: Access to the high-accuracy models (like the ones you mentioned) with custom context injection, bypassing the "no official subs" problem entirely—and covering the heavy processing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are currently doing market research on fair pricing for the Pro tier. Your input helps us frame the value proposition immesnely. Thank you for pushing us on this critical commercial decision!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metacognitive AI system. The focus here is on the various internal systems versus the LLM itself. Basically giving an AI agent the ability to do all the things it cant do from a one step turn interaction that you usually see from just a chat bot. It is comprised of many specialized LLM's that have all their own roles and specialties. They will have the ability to cross talk with each other internally share post processed information make analysis and all that jazz, but not to do tasks but to reason in a similar manner to how a human reasons. Think of it as many thought traces that are giving advice to the main "orchestrator" human front facing agent and have him consolidate all the relevant information before interacting with the human. At first I am introducing basic subagent systems like logical fallacy and leading questions subagent (watches to notice if the human is making assumptions without evidence), paranoia subagent (watched for intentional or unintentional human lying and fact checker), and many other sub systems. But I also have plans for introducing a "pain" management subagent which will take notice of errors in tool calling or some sort of failures and bring that to the front of the attention of the orchestrator based on a threshold criteria. Also it will have a memory system that if working correctly should allow it to reduce the amount of mistakes it makes on something that it had already made a mistake of before. Anyways there is a lot more to it this is just scratching the surface but basically its my attempt to create the human brain communication system virtually with llm systems and many scripts and grounding metadata and a bunch of other goodies. The cherry on top will be once I am done making a text based translation layer for the system that will allow the agent to modify its own internal structure as it needs for any specific task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently building a suite of media inspection and encoding tools for video engineers: https://video-commander.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still a work in progress, but expecting to release by end of year. Built on Rust + Tauri, in case anyone is curious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've created various open-source and commercial tools in the multimedia space over the last 10+ years and wanted to put it all together into something more premium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A monster trainer game where you can _actually teach new, creative moves_ to your monsters: https://youtu.be/ThOCM9TK_yo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, think of it as "Pokemon the anime, but for real". We allow you to use your voice to talk to, command, and train your monster. You and your monster are in this sandbox-y, dynamic environment where your actions have side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can train to fight or just to mess around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, we are converting player's voice into code in real time to give life to these monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- What: Sun Grid Engine–style scheduler + Docker on System-on-Module (SoM) boards for reproducible tests/benchmarks and interactive SSH sessions (remote dev). - Who: Robotics/embedded engineers comparing SoMs and tuning models/pipelines on target platforms. - Why: Reproducible runs, easy board access, comparable reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulled this side project off the shelf — something I started after covid, when I was working at one of the consumer robotics companies (used to be the largest back then). Got it mostly working, but never actually released. I tend to dust it off and push it along a bit whenever I’m between jobs. Like now... Feels good to be back at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a infinite canvas for AI image/video/audio/3D generation. in other tools, its easy to create one off AI images/videos, but to create a cohesive story with consistent characters and locations is very difficult. https://www.flickspeed.ai/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: https://circuitscript.net/. A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the last month, I have created a complete schematic with Circuitscript, exported the netlist to pcbnew and designed the PCB. The boards have been produced and currently waiting for them to be delivered to verify that it works. Quite excited since this will be the first design ever produced with Circuitscript as the schematic capture tool!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i got a side project mirubato https://mirubato.com/, a web app tracking instrument practice logs. there were wild ideas such as enable AI training, grading, managing score, practice plans, and such, but in the end, i removed most of features. not only because it takes more time (i am only using a part of my free time to work on this) and effort, talent, plannings, but also because during vibe (yes, most of coding done by claude code) i realized that it still requires ultra deep thinking to design the minimal minimal UI i would like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;now the foundation is done, i've learnt a lot. i'm actually eating dog food by using it to track my own classical guitar practice everyday. i am pausing a while to process the requirements by ultra deep thinking to understand what would be helpful and how to shape the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs such as codex and claude code definitely helped a lot, but I guess human beings' opinions would be more helpful - after all, the tool is made for humans instead of being used by claude code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would also like to hear when you start a project, if you know your audience are not super close to AI, would you still consider to enable the AI feature for them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Daestro[0], which is a cloud agnostic job orchestrator with built-in support for AWS, Vultr, DigitalOcean and Linode to run jobs on. Daestro can spawn and terminate compute instances based on requirement. It is suitable for running batch jobs or data engineering related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-hosted compute can also be linked to Daestro to run jobs on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out how modern internal API management should work like and started https://www.appear.sh/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After spending so much of my career dealing with APIs and building tooling for that I feel there's huge gap between what is needed and possible vs how the space generally works. There's a plethora of great tools that do one job really well, but when you want to use them the integration will kill you. When you want to get your existing system in them it takes forever. When you want to connect those tools that takes even longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality I'm seeing around myself and hearing from people we talk to is that most companies have many services in various stages of decay. Some brand new and healthy, some very old, written by people who left, acquired from different companies or in languages that were abandoned. And all of that software is still generating a lot of value for the company and to be able to leverage that value APIs are essential. But they are incredibly hard and slow to use, and the existing tools don't make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spent last week at a Java conference, and it made me realise that I haven't made many open source contributions of late. So I'm currently going through the issue trackers of the projects I rely on the most to see where I can pitch in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on an engine that will allow me to play the old DOS game "Eye of the Beholder" with the original assets. It's mostly an exercise for me to up my golang skills and to explore what coding was like in the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Came from my frustration with Google Maps in Germany constantly having take-down requests for bad reviews and ratings. To get around this, we only list places we recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A “code index” tool that finds symbols in a codebase and creates a single table sqlite database for querying. It’s my second month using Claude Code, and I see a common pattern where Claude tries to guess patterns with grep, and often comes back with empty results. I’m writing the tool to prevent these fruitless searches. Using tree-sitter to parse the AST and add the symbols and what they are (function, class, argument, etc) to the db. I have it working with TypeScript, and am working on adding C and PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why codepathfinder.dev is born. It underhood use tree-sitter to search functions, class, member variables and pulls code accurately instead of regex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started using it like tool call in Security scanning (think of something like claude-code for security scanning)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aider builds something it calls a "repo map" that I believe is for a similar purpose. Might be worth taking a look!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't used Claude Code, but recently switched to OpenCode. My token usage and cost is a lot higher, I'm not sure why yet, but I suspect Aider's approach is much more lean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Message inspection from any topic — trace and analyze messages, view flow, lag, and delivery status&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Anomaly detection &amp;amp; forecasting — predict lag spikes, throughput drops, and other unusual behaviors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Real-time dashboards for brokers, topics, partitions, and consumer groups&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Track config changes across clusters and understand their impact on performance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Interactive log search with filtering by topic, partition, host, and message fields&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Build custom dashboards &amp;amp; widgets to visualize metrics that matter to your team&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What pain points do you face in monitoring Kafka, which features would you like next, and any improvements to dashboards, log search, or message inspection?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on a one week side-project that ended up taking over a year… Working on it periodically with friends to add new features and patch bugs, at the moment I'm trying to expand the file sharing capabilities. It's been a journey and I have learnt quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aim of this is to be a simple platform to share content with others. Appreciate any feedback, this is my first time building a user facing platform. If the free tier is limiting, I've made a coupon "HELLOWORLD" if you want to stress test or try the bigger plans, it gives you 100% off for 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s designed to plug into frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, or LangChain and help agents learn from both successful and failed interactions - so instead of each execution being isolated, the system builds up knowledge about what actually works in specific scenarios and applies that as contextual guidance next time. The aim is to move beyond static prompts and manual tweaks by letting agents improve continuously from their own runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently also working on an MCP interface to it, so people can easily try it in e.g. Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a tool[0] to address how hard it is for non-technical people to understand the text-based code from vibe coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach is to make the complexity more readable by using three simple block types to represent logic, data, and UI, which are connected by cables – a bit like wiring up components on an electronics breadboard –.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of spitting out a wall of code, the AI generates these visual blocks and makes the right connections between them. The ultimate goal is to make the output from LLM more accessible and actionable for everyone, not just developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drawing a lot of inspiration from interval.com. It was an amazing product but was a hosted SAAS. I'm exploring taking the idea to the .NET ecosystem and also making it a Nuget package that can be installed and served through any ASP.NET project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A unified platform for product teams to announce updates, maintain a changelog, share roadmaps, provide help documentation and collect feedback with the help of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal is to help product teams tell users about new features (so they actually use them), gather meaningful feedback (so they build the right things), share plans (so users know what's coming), and provide help (so users don't get stuck).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing it as an indie hacker + solo founder + lean. Started 13 days ago. Posting about my journey on Youtube every week day https://www.youtube.com/@dave_cheong&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently chipping away at DSC, a tensor library I wrote from scratch to play with large language models. Last week I re-wrote flash attention from scratch in CUDA and was able to get good perf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks, what do you mean with "any-script-managed HTML"? If you mean that you can use any script, like e.g. a bash script, to generate static HTML files, then yes, in a way Mastro is basically that script. Except that it comes with a server as well – both for local development and production, should a static site no longer suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an instagram style UI but for scrolling through record releases and snippets, worked on making it responsive as possible with low latency audio playback so you can browse a lot of stuff quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My personal website/webring. It's mostly a collection of ideas I've been mulling over and holding off on due to not being able to iterate on them fast enough. Nowadays thanks to AI, a lot of these a short errands so it's been a fun few weeks. I've also started chucking a few previous side projects under more unified domains. [1][2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also working on a youtube channel [3] for my climbing/travel videos, but the dreary state of that website has me wondering whether it's worth it, tbh. I haven't been able to change my channel name after trying for weeks. It's apparently the best place to archive edited GoPro footage at least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's quite an interesting process to vibe code game stuff where I have a vague concept of how to achieve things but no experience/muscle memory with three.js &amp;amp; friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on AirSend — we help workers to get paid in fiat currency but spend in stablecoins. Clients can pay invoices in fiat (like USD or EUR), and it’s automatically converted into USDC inside your wallet (0.5% platform fees).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From there, users can either send funds to another wallet or spend directly using a pre-funded debit card. It’s still early, but we’re testing with a small group of users who want to receive payments faster and avoid PayPal or wire fees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a freelancer or digital nomads interested in trying it out, you can check it out here: https://useairsend.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://lustroczynszowe.pl/ The aggregator of rental values in Poland. We want to increase the transparency of the real estate market, empowering consumers and enabling them to make fully informed financial decisions. We will also suggest savings on specific fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a performance capture library for Python because I often need to know the performance of backend systems I maintain. I frequently build tooling to capture performance and save it for later analysis. I/O operations get costly when writing lots of data to disk and creating good real-time analytics tools takes a lot of my time. I wanted a library that captures real-time performance analytics from Python backends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I wrote kronicler to record performance metrics while being fast and simple to implement. I built my own columnar database in Rust to capture and analyze these logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To capture logs, `import kronicler` and add `@kronicler.capture` as a decorator to functions in Python. It will then start saving performance metrics to the custom database on disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then view these performance metrics by adding a route to your server called `/logs` where you return `DB.logs()`. You can paste your hosted URL into the settings of usekronicler.com (the online dashboard) and view your data with a couple charts. View the readme or the website for more details for how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on features like concurrency and other overall improvements. I would love some feedback to help shape this product into something useful for you all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a donations powered marketplace, zero platform fee: https://shomp.co&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Merchants who want to sell on Etsy or Shopify either have to pay a listing fee or pay per month just to keep an online store on the web. Our goal is to provide a perpetually free marketplace that is powered solely off donations. The only fees merchants pay are the Stripe fees, and it's possible that at some volume of usage we will be able to negotiate those down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can sell digital goods as well as physical goods. Right now in the "manual onboarding" phase for our first batch of sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For digital goods, purchasers get a download link for files (hosted on R3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For physical goods, once a purchase comes through, the seller gets an SMS notification and a shipping label gets created. The buyer gets notified of the tracking number and on status changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use Stripe Connect to manage KYC (know your customer) identities so we don't store any of your sensitive details other than your name and email. Since we are in the process of incorporating as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we are only serving sellers based in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mission of the company is to provide entrepreneurial training to people via our online platform, as well as educational materials to that aim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now the API is nonexistent, relying entirely on people using the web interface to make listings, upload photos, and set prices. But if you would find this useful I can happily build it out. Our stack is Elixir and building APIs is very straightforward. Our code is open-source, too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you say "algorithmically driven print-on-demand" do you mean that prices would automatically adjust based on inventory? Or like, how do you mean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, when you say "see them show up in a request on sale" — can you clarify? I interpret this to mean you want a webhook triggered when an order comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to provide a fully typed nodeJS framework that allows you to write a typescript function once and then decide whether to wire it up to http, websocket, queues, scheduled tasks, mcp server, cli and other interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can switch between serverless and server deployments without any refactoring / completely agnostic to whatever platform your running it on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also provides services, permissions, auth, eventhub, advanced tree shaking, middleware, schema generation and validation and more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way it works is by scanning your project via the typescript compiler and generating a bootstrap file that imports everything you need (hence tree shaking), and allows you to filter down your backend to only the endpoints needed (great to pluck out individual entry points for serverless). It also generates types fetch, rpc, websocket and queue client files. Types is pretty much most of what pikku is about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think honoJS and nestJS sort of combined together and also decided to support most server standards / not just http.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Website needs love, currently working on a release to support CLI support and full tree shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree framing pikku has been a pretty hard challenge for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports different runtimes in the sense of deno / bun or custom nodeJS runtimes in the cloud, but ultimately relies purely on typescript / a JavaScript compatible backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s less of a webserver and more of a lightweight framework though, since it also supports CLIs or Frontend SDKs / isn’t tied to running an actual server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started working on digital nomad event and workation aggregator two months ago. https://reorient.guide/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That main usecase is done. I’m now focusing on travel guides for remote workers. Goal is to help those new to a country to become as productive as they would be at home within 2-3 hours upon landing at the airport. I completed 80% of a guide to South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started working on these guides after my friends in Tokyo commented during our last co-working session on how fast I got to our favourite spot (Tokyo Innovation Base) from Narita Airport; they thought I was already in-town.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a project: https://hpyhn.xyz. It's a website for analyzing posts and comments on HN. The idea started as a way to help me learn from discussions and filter out posts I don't interest in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on my SaaS that monitors third-party status pages - https://incidenthub.cloud/ It's a one-person project I started last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest technical challenge remains dealing with the immense number of different APIs (and not-APIs) in the different status pages out there. Marketing remains my biggest overall challenge as my background is engineering, but I've learnt quite a bit since I launched this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I already mentioned last month I was working on a appendix in Wiktionary for synonym of Esperanto terms constructed with the mal- prefix[1]. Actually it's a bit more generic as it also encompasses a few other antonymic prefixes, but mal- is the main tool in that category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With more than 300 references and around 1500 entries, covering more than all the lemma given in the reference dictionary Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto, I now consider it achieved. Well, apart some formatting of references where I still need to fix issues related to import of template/modules from an other wiki. :D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give a perspective, in one of the Esperanto sentence collection referenced in the appendix, I found a bit more than 7000 terms mal- words, which once stripped of the most common inflection and affixes went down to 3000 entries. I didn't check in details this remaining set, but my guess is that the remaining difference was still mostly due to less frequent affix combinations that my naive filter didn't catch. For recall Esperanto is a highly agglutinative language and encourage the use of a regular affix set to express many derivative terms from a common stem, so empowering expressivity though combinatorial reuse. So only twice the size of the proposed entries in the appendix is a very low figure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I initially had this project ideas years ago, and it came back to my mind as I started to contribute to the port of Raku into esperanto[3]. This came back as we were going through the considerations for the lsb routine, where LSB stands for Least Significant Bit. The common way to express least is malplej (countryman-of-most), which is generally ok but can be instead replaced by mej, for example if terseness is a highly weighted desired trait. That allows for example to use mejpezbit’ instead of some alternative synonym like malplej signifa duumaĵo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://finbodhi.com — It helps you track, understand, and plan your personal finances — with a double-entry accounting. You own your data. It’s local-first, syncs across devices, and everything’s encrypted in transit. Supports multi-currency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are in it for long term. Not a startup, not looking for investment. Just plain paid product (free while in beta) by a few people. We have a few active users, and are looking for more before we remove the beta label :) It's a PWA app. Currently targeted for desktops. For personal software, I think local-first makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m currently working on https://www.dreamly.in - automated, personalized, and localized bedtime stories for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My daughter loves stories, and I often struggled to come up with new ones every night. I remember enjoying local folk tales and Indian mythological stories from my childhood, and I wanted her to experience that too — while also learning new things like basic science concepts and morals through stories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built Dreamly and opened it up to friends and families. Parents can set up their child’s profile once - name, age, favorite shows or characters, and preferred themes (e.g. morals, history, mythology, or school concepts). After that, personalized stories are automatically delivered to their inbox every night. No more scrambling to think of stories on the spot!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like reading to my kids and try to read to them in English and Mandarin. My Chinese is conversational, but I have a hard time finding books for them because I’m not good at writing. Something like this with language learning tools would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also like making up stories when we go on hikes. Long, rambling stories about unicorns befriending spiders and flying to faraway lands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently building a Declarative Web Assembler of Html/Json using AI in multiple languages for the past 1 month: https://github.com/Srid68/Arshu.Assembler deployed to fly.io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose is to find if can i build declarative software in multiple langauges (Rust, Go, Node.Js, PHP and Javascript) knowing only one language (C#) without understanding the implementation deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another purpose is validate AI models and their efficiency since development using AI is hard but highly productive and having a declarative rules to recreate the implementation may be used to validate models&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently i am convinced it is possible to build, but now working on creating a solid foundation with tests of the two assembler engines, structure dumps, logging, logging outputs so that those can be used by the AI which it needs to fix issues iteratively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Need to add more declarative rules and implement a full stack web assembler to see if AI will hit the technical debt which slows/stop progress. Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TPS takt scheduling and execution system. It is a system to support any kind of production or logistics process in Toyota Production System way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You define resources needed for activity, time per activity, dependencies between activities to complete a process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you input the process you want to complete, you get a schedule similar to a gantt chart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System displays which activities should be ongoing at any moment, you click gui or call API to complete the activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After process is complete you get a report of delays and deviations by Takts, activities and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on that report you can decide what improvements to make to your process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://www.fontofweb.com because design inspiration platforms don’t give enough real material to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most sites fall into extremes: Dribbble leans toward polished mockups that never shipped, while Awwwards and Mobbin go heavy on curation. The problem isn’t just what they pick — it’s that you only ever see a narrow slice. High curation means low volume, slow updates, and a bias toward showcase projects instead of the everyday, functional interfaces most of us actually design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Font of Web takes a different approach. It’s closer to Pinterest, but purely for web design. Every “pin” comes with metadata: fonts, colors, and the exact domain it came from, so you can search, filter, and sort in ways you can’t elsewhere. The text search is powered by multimodal embeddings, so you can use search queries like “minimalist pricing page with illustrations at the side” and get live matches from real websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;natural language search (e.g. “elegant serif blog with sage green”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for checking it out. I'm using a 3rd party API for all the station info (radio-browser.info) and sometimes the station streams result in that error. You may have just had some bad luck clicking on a few in a row that don't work. I'll try to think of a way to filter those broken ones out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Plaid / Perplexity for business data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that integrating business data into a B2B app or AI agent process is a pain. On one side there's web data providers (Clearbit, Apollo, ZoomInfo) then on the other, 150 year old legacy providers based on government data (D&amp;amp;B, Factset, Moody's, etc). You'd be surprised to learn how much manual work is still happening - teams of people just manually researching business entities all day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a high level, we're building out a series of composable deep research APIs. It's built on a business graph powered by integrations to global government registrars and a realtime web search index. Our government data index is 265M records so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're still pretty early and working with enterprise design partners for finance and compliance use cases. Open to any thoughts or feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Working on Kanji Palace (https://kanjipalace.com): We're going to publish the iOS app on the App Store and adding vocabulary. Currently, the app converts single Kanji (e.g., 生) into vivid mnemonic images. We aim to support vocabulary like 先生.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Writing a book about Claude Code, not just for assisted programming, but as a general AI agent framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a sync infra product that is meant to cut down 6 months of development time, and years of maintenance of deep CRM sync for B2B SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Salesforce instance is a unique snowflake. I am moving that customization into configuration and building a resilient infrastructure for bi-directional sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been building a mostly free website and API to interact with sec EDGAR filings, get realtime new filing alerts (and preview those alerts), and see the historical impact of financial filings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I am working on adding historical tables extracted from filings, as well as historical financials and their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are in the early stage of building the platformed version of our current WordPress plugin https://www.pathmetrics.io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a full funnel marketing attribution &amp;amp; insights tool with the intent of making marketing &amp;amp; marketing spends more transparent. We started from creating an utm tracking tool for our agency clients and currently it's a product on its own. We'll make it a platform to remove some of the limits that we have with WordPress and reach a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got tired of Spotify recommending me the same songs, from the same artists, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built Riff Radar - it creates playlists from your followed artists' complete discography, and allows you to tailor them in multiple ways. Those playlists are my top listened to. I know, because you can also see your listening statistics (at the mercy of Spotify's API).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The playlists also get updated daily. Think of it as a better version of the daily mixes Spotify creates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I tried to save a newly created playlist I got a 500 XHR with message: "failed to fetch user playlists: Error 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'AND disabled = 0' at line 4", about 2mins ago, if that help finding this is logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oops that's embarassing - it should be good now :) Thanks! That was a classic case of fixing one thing and breaking another, which my tests didn't catch :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between contributing to FrankenPHP (FrankenPHP.dev), I’ve been working on AtlasDb (https://github.com/bottledcode/atlas-db), its a distributed edge database — or it will be when I’m finished. There are a few unique things that make it more robust than etcd, and more scalable. Right now, it basically works except under certain types of contention, which I’ve been trying to solve for a couple of days now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people often ask questions like: - How do I lose body fat and build muscle? - How can I track progress over time? - How much exercise do I actually need? - What should my calorie and macro targets be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on https://booplet.com. It's like Lovable but for desktop apps and heavily inspired by Robin Sloan's home-cooked app essay [1][2]. The idea is to let anyone, especially non-technical folks, build and use personal apps. Instead of cloud deployment, we focused on a local-first setup so that users can fully own their apps and data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on an advanced analytics tool for 0DTE trade data, which allows to scan through massive amounts of data in the least amount of time, find seasonal patterns created by institutional investors, blast credit chains for profitable trades and simulate / backtest arbitrary trades in conjunction to create portfolios. So far the software yielded several successful trading strategies, which outperform standard approaches ever since the new administration in the US came to power. Currently in closed beta but planning to release around Xmas eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common lisp (sbcl) roguelike, to (re)learn Emacs and CL for fun. Using croatoan for ncurses, though if I had found BearLibTerminal earlier I might have used that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you. That means a lot. I hope to fully finish it by the end of the month as it's still riddled with small bugs. But feel free to fork it: https://github.com/danielterwiel/terwiel.io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should be as easy as updating all data in the data/ folder and you can get your own version. Mind you: getting the SVG logos right is the hard part&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An app to track my work automatically by feeding screenshots to LLMs and analyzing those. https://donethat.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously this is quite sensitive data so architected it to never store raw data, allow for bring-your-own-key, and even in team settings be fully private by default, everybody keeps control of all their results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started about six months ago, have some first users, and always looking for feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I can finally test on hardware, I completely rewrote input handling. I can now support original NES controllers, but also SNES and the Power Pad dance mat, for anyone crazy enough to try that. The hardest part was working around a particularly nasty hardware bug: if you try to read the input ports on even cycles while one of the sound channels is playing, the data becomes corrupted. Perform the exact same read on an odd cycle and it works every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution? Have the cartridge keep track of CPU parity (there's no simple way to do this with just the CPU), then check that, skip one cycle if needed... and very carefully cycle time the rest of the routine, making sure that your reads land on safe cycles, and your writes land in places that won't throw off the alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it works! It's quite reliable on every console revision I've thrown it at so far. Suuuper happy with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on expanding the Pacific Northwest’s largest durable carbon removal project using Enhanced Rock Weathering and starting a $1m SAFE fundraising round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We received data last week verifying we are effectively mineralizing CO2 at a high rate while saving our farmer $135/acre annually in liming costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve come this far on grants. Now it’s time to fundraise so we can bankroll our PhDs whilst we secure pre-purchase offtake deals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know of any impact investors or are an offtake buyer at a large company, please email me at zach@goal300.earth&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For context, I'm a UX Designer at a low-code company. LLMs are great at cranking out prototypes using well-known React component libraries. But lesser known low-code syntax takes more work. We made an MCP server that helps a lot, but what I'm working on now is a set of steering docs to generate components and prototypes that are "backwards compatible" with our bespoke front end language. This way our vibe prototyping has our default look out of the box and translates more directly to production code. https://github.com/pglevy/sail-zero&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be helpful for the box for each test to include some explanation, eg:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;25-Hydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcidiol, regulates calcium absorption in the intestines, promotes bone formation and mineralization, and supports immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is a protein that binds to LDL receptors on cells, allowing lipoproteins to deliver cholesterol and triglycerides to tissues for energy or storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lipoprotein(a) is a low-density lipoprotein variant identified as a risk factor for atherosclerosis and related diseases, such as coronary heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love to see the Red Cross partner with someone like you here in Australia. Not affiliated, just a donor. We're not financially incentivised like other countries but there's a big culture here about celebrating the free milkshake and/or sausage roll you get after donating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on a new Python HTTP client which is 100% Rust-based (sync+async). Using reqwest under the hood and providing everything it has to offer to Python land + much more. Also including mocking capabilities. Here: https://github.com/MarkusSintonen/pyreqwest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started from the poor state of many Python HTTP clients and poor testing utilities there is for them. (Eg the neglected state of httpx and its all perf issues)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a filmmaker, so I built myself the filmmaking community tool that I wanted to use. I'm headed to filmquest in provo this month to premiere my short and that's gonna be a big test of my application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's two scripts up there that are AI generated for exhibition purposes. Everything else was written AFAIK by a human. The cover images are made by AI, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the Scores are human made, Galleries, and Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make a place where AI enhances the creator and doesn't replace them. Check the about page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a multisig solution for authenticated file distribution, initially targeting GitHub releases. Based on minisig and git.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this project is an interesting addition as a software supply chain solution, but generating interest in the project in this early stage proves difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to turn code into a design tool. Kind of like if you ask yourself - what if Cursor had been built for designers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- code editor directly in the browser - writes to your local file system - UI-specific features built into the editor - ways to edit the CSS visually as well as using code - integrated AI chat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I have tons of features I want to add. Asset management, image generation, collaborative editing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's still a prototype, but I'm actively posting about it on twitter as I go. Soon, I'll probably start publishing versioned builds for people to play with: https://x.com/danielvaughn&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is hard to show that AI can reimplement for example special relativity - because we don't even have enough text from 19th century to train an LLM on it - so we need a new idea something that was invented after an LLM was trained. I took the Gwern's essay and checked with deep search and deep research which ideas from that essay are truly novel and apparently there are some so reinventing them seemed like a good target: https://github.com/zby/DayDreamingDayDreaming/blob/main/repo...https://github.com/zby/DayDreamingDayDreaming/blob/main/repo...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here it is - a system that can reliably churn essays on daydreaming AIs. On one level it is kind of silly - we already knew that infinite monkeys could write Shakespeare works. The generator was always theoretically possible, the hard part is the verifier. But still - the search space in my system is much smaller than the search space of all possible letter sequences - so at least I can show that the system is a little more practical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can modify it to reinvent any other new idea - you just need to provide it the inspirations and evals for checking the generated essays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am thinking about next steps - maybe I could do it a little bit more universal - but it seems that to build something that would work as needed would require scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kind of like the software framework I vibe coded for this. It lets you easily build uniform samples where you can legitimately do all kinds of comparisons. But I am not so sure about using Dagster as the base for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm in The Hague right now at a digital democracy conference, where I was invited to present on my prototype that I've been building the past few months!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's for doing realtime "human cartography", to make maps of who we are together in complex large-scale discourse (even messy protest).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's for exploring human perspective data -- agree, disagree, pass reactions to dozens or hundreds of belief statements -- so we can read it as if it were Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My operating assumption is that if a critical mass of us can understand culture and value clashes as mere shapes of discourse, and we can all see it together, the we can navigate them more dispassionately and with clear heads. Kinda like reading a map or watching the weather report -- islands that rise from oceans, or plate tectonics that move like currents over months, and terraform the human landscape -- maybe if we can see these things together, we'll act less out of fear of fun-house caricatures. (E.g., "Hey, dad, it seems like the peninsula you're on is becoming a land bridge toward the alt right corner. I feel a little bummed about that. How do you feel about it?")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(It builds on data and the mathematical primitives of a great tool called Pol.is, which I've worked with for almost a decade.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A LLM‑powered OSINT helper app that lets you build an interactive research graph. People, organizations, websites, locations, and other entities are captured as nodes, and evidence is represented as relationships between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually assistants like ChatGPT Deep Research or Perplexity are focused on fully automatic question answering, and this app lets you guide the search process interactively, while retaining knowledge in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plan is to integrate it with multiple OSINT-related APIs, scrapers, etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to catch vulnerabilities early in the SDLC by running agentic loop that autonomously hunt for security issues in codebases.Currently available as a CLI tool, VSCode extension.I've been actively using to scan WordPress, odoo plugins and found several privilege escalation vuln. I have documented as blog post here: https://codepathfinder.dev/blog/introducing-secureflow-cli-t...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a new version of my distraction free writing app, poe-writer. https://getpoe.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New version is a rebuild in react with cleaner interface, localisation, a bunch of new features and lays the groundwork to allow full html docs instead of only markdown&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lovely interface. This is quite impressive. I can't seem to get a terminal running though. Can I actually execute scripts here? I opened code and created a hello.py, terminal did not come up in Code either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conductor is a LLM agnostic framework for building sophisticated AI applications using a subagent architecture. It provides a robust platform for orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents to accomplish complex tasks, with features like LLM-based planning, memory persistence, and dynamic tool use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It provides a robust and flexible platform for orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents to accomplish complex tasks. This project is inspired by the concepts outlined in "The Rise of Subagents" by Phil Schmid at https://www.philschmid.de/the-rise-of-subagents and it aims to provide a practical implementation of this powerful architectural pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same as last time, I guess. It's a voxel building environment that uses irregular voxels (voxels with sloped faces). I've been working on fixing the bugs for a while now (and there are still a lot of them left).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on two graph optimization libraries for quantum computers. The first one was released a few months ago and the next version will make it much more powerful. The second one is currently being tested. Both of them work on actual quantum computers, which makes them exciting :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In parallel, I'm trying to figure out how to train a LLM for SAST.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is this popular coffee cup cooling problem: assume you want to keep your morning cup of coffee hot for as long as possible. When do you add your milk? Immediately or later?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am overengineering a simulation-based solution to this because I think there are scenarios based on cup shapes and environmental temperatures that allow either answer to be true. This will end up as a blog post I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Leggen (https://github.com/elisiariocouto/leggen), a self hosted personal banking account management system. It started out as a CLI that syncs your bank account transactions and balances, saves them in a sqlite database and can alert you via Telegram or Discord if a transaction matches a filter. Recently I started refactoring the project with the help of Claude Code and Copilot Agent to include an API and a Web app to explore the data and configure it. The product is using GoCardless Bank Accout Data APIs to connect to banks via PSD2 but I found out recently that registering a new account is no longer possible so I’m currently looking into alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out Lunch Flow (https://lunchflow.app) for a global open banking API that's accessible for personal finance apps :) We integrate with Gocardless, among other global open banking providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on cataloging a curated list of craft beer venues across the world at https://wheretodrink.beer Unsure what the plan is going forward with it, apart from adding more venues and more countries. As long as it's fun for me I'll just keep adding things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just added health inspection data from countries that have that in open datasets (UK and Denmark). If anyone know of others I'd be appreciative of hints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking of focusing on another idea for the rest of the year, have a rough idea for a map based ui to structure history by geofences or lat / lng points for small local museums&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal was to make the learning material very malleable, so all content can be viewed through different "lenses" (e.g. made simpler, more thorough, from first principles, etc.). A bit like Wikipedia it also allows for infinite depth/rabbit holing. Each document links to other documents, which link to other documents (...).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also currently in the middle of adding interactive visualizations which actually work better than expected! Some demos:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on the web reader of WithAudio. Just add with.audio/ to begining of a public URL and get the text and audio in your browser. It runs the TTS in your browser so its free and unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I buit this to get some traffic to my main project's website using a free tool people might like. The main project: https://desktop.with.audio -&amp;gt; a one time payment text to speech app with text highlighting and export mp3 and other features on MacOS (ARM only) and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on www.accrux.co. It basically just a project that allows finance and investors bring their diversified portfolios and manage multiple portfolios together into one place. As a little investor myself that have some crypto, stock and fixed assets, I find it difficult bringing some of my investments together that was why i decided to build this. The goal and aim is just to bring clarity into your investments and have it as your investment companion which gives your detailed insight and time to time alerts on the health of your portfolios. I currently have it in testing and if anyone is willing to give it a try https://appstaging.accrux.co/signup here or reply so i can take you through a demo.. It is completely free for the few months and may charge a couple of dollars after a while after more features are added to cater for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm doing some experiments in LLM (historical) fiction writing. I feel like we can get pretty good writing out of an LLM (especially Sonnet) with enough prompting, reasoning, and guided thinking. Still with a human as producer and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to use this to create stories that would be somewhat unreasonable to write otherwise. Branching stories (i.e., CYOA), multiperspective stories, some multimedia. I'm still trying to figure out the narrative structures that might work well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs can overproduce and write in different directions than is reasonable for a regular author. Though even then I'm finding branching hard to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big challenges are rhythm, pacing, following an arc. Those have been hard for LLMs all along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Porting my binary &amp;amp; decimal palindromes[0] finding code[1] to CUDA, with which I had no experience before starting this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's already working, and slightly faster than the CPU version, but that's far from an acceptable result. The occupancy (which is a term I first learned this week) is currently at a disappointing 50%, so there's a clear target for optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I'm satisfied with how the code runs on my modest GPU at home, the plan is to use some online GPU renting service to make it go brrrrrrrrrr and see how many new elements I can find in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re always on. They log into real sites, click around, fill out forms, and adapt when pages change — no brittle scripts, no APIs needed. You can deploy one in minutes, host it yourself, and watch it do work like a human (but faster, cheaper, never tired).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kind of like a “browser-use cloud,” except it’s yours — open, self-hostable, and way more capable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been casually getting into thrifting and realized pretty quickly that Lens is super limited in its functionality and is mostly a shopping app. I put a site together that is like a supercharged version of Lens for thrifters where you can get info on price, demand, and condition. Share function is borked atm tho&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://practicecallai.com/ - simple saas that lets users run practice calls / role play against a custom AI partner. Goal is to make it the easiest to use &amp;amp; fastest to get started with in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a fun, practical way to continuously evaluate the latest models two ways - via coding assistance &amp;amp; swapping between models to power the conversational AI voice partner. I’ve been trying to add one big new feature each time the model generation updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next thing I want to add is a self improving feedback loop where it uses user ratings of the calls &amp;amp; evaluations to refine the prompts that generate them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plugging away with reviews of Genrative AI tech with detailed comparisons. I announced the launch on HN a while ago, thought I’d use this month’s for a status update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just took Qwen-Image and Google’s image AIs for a spin and I keep a side by side comparison of many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks, the 3D asset creators are very interesting. I'm working on LLM -&amp;gt; CAD tool (for 3d printing) and your post confirms that I should keep my focus, because there is so much other things to do (uv unwrapping!) if you are targeting games for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been building proficiency with quantum optics equipment. Repeating classic quantum entanglement experiments like the quantum eraser [0] and violating the CHSH inequality (which won the 2022 Nobel). I’m working towards a novel quantum eraser variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a browser plugin for Amazon that attempts to identify the brand and seller country: https://www.wheresthatfrom.org/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's mostly where I want it to be now, but still need to automate the ingest of USPTO data. I'd really like it to show a country flag on the search results page next to each item, but inferring the brand name just from the item title would probably need some kind of natural language processing; if there's even a brand in the title.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No support for their mobile layout. Do many people buy from their phone?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a DNS service for AWS EC2 to keep the ever changing IPs when you cannot use the Elastic IP like ASG or when you don't want to install any third party clients to your instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It fetches the IPs regularly via AWS API and assign them to fixed subdomains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Porting a game to SteamDeck my friends did. The game is python based with a bespoke OpenGL game engine. Got a native linux build out a week ago. Currently working on controller support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m refactoring https://harcstack.org so that it can handle Theme plugins. Next after Pico CSS is Bulma. The idea is to complement HTMX on the server side with functional HTML coding (inspired by elmlang), components and a base library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a web app that creates easy-to-understand stories and explainers for the sake of language learning. You can listen in your favourite podcast app, or directly on the website with illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm eager to add more languages if anyone is fluent/able to help me evaluate the text-to-speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making an app for self-tracking. Combining elements from habit trackers, health logging and journaling. Built for rich customization and local-first. Want to be free of rigid structures of many existing apps while providing a better UX / usability than using a spreadhsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past 2 years we are trying to bring some order to the chaos called restaurant menu creation. Correctify is a platform combining all the features restaurants need for both online and print menus with most tasbs being automated with AI https://correctify.com.cy/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides a master's degree and an internship at a nutrition AI app startup, I'm taking another pass at procedural dungeon generation for my world-building website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on the Mint programming language (https://mint-lang.com/) and DevBox (https://www.dev-box.app/) which is a desktop application/browser extension/web application with a bunch of small tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been following Mint for a while and it feels like a project that truly focuses on making developers happy. The mix of Elm style structure, strong typing, and builtin tools like testing and formatting makes it really enjoyable to use. Keep up your great works!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just finished writing a small script that finds all optimally bad Wordle guesses. More precisely, on hard Wordle, where you must give a valid word (from the guesses list), and you must use yellows + greens, and must not use greys, what are all the combinations of answer + 6 guesses where there is only grey. This is equivalent to finding all answer + 6 guesses where no letters are in common between any pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is basically a variation on bit-packing (which is NP-hard), but it's tractable if you prune the search space enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is going in fits and starts, but I'm working on a Win16 decompiler. The problems with existing decompiler tools for 16-bit code are a) support the NE file format is far less widespread; b) 16-bit code means geating to deal with segment registers, which are largely unmodelled for most binary tools; and c) turns out that you also have to get really good at recognizing "this is a 32-bit value being accessed entirely in 16-bit word chunks," which tends to be under-supported for most optimization toolchains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You provide your URL and an LLM browses your site and writes up feedback. Currently working on increasing the quality of the feedback. Trying to start with a narrower set of tests that give what I think is good feedback, then increase from there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a tool like this analyzed your website, what would you actually want it to tell you? What feedback would be most useful?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An open source campaign management app for TTRPGs. There are a ton out there, that are basically just fancy wikis. I'm working on one in Django for running my old school D&amp;amp;D game i'm starting back up this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This weekend I added a broken link monitor to https://SecurityBot.dev. It will scan a site and flag 400, 403, 404, and 500 HTTP status codes. Screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I slowly work on the public release of Submerge VCS, and SQLite driver for my factory simulation game (in Odin) with online trading system (in Erlang).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on adding favicons support to listings on my website directory I recently launched: https://intrasti.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just released the changelog 5 minutes ago https://intrasti.com/changelog which I went with a directory based approach using the international date format YYYY-MM-DD so in the source code it's ./changelog/docs/YYYY/MM/DD.md - seems to do the trick and ready for pagination which I haven't implemented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on: https://github.com/xlnfinance/xln — a new financial EVM-Layer2 protocol that unifies banking and DeFi into one programmable layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think Lightning, but on EVM, with credit that’s provable and enforceable. No sequencers. No DA risk. O(1) per-hop scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to measure real intelligence — human or machine — paste this prompt into any LLM and watch what happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prompt: “Comprehend the following concept in full depth. Derive all its implicit implications, design questions, and systemic consequences. Explain why it matters, where it fits in economic history, and what architectures or institutions it could disrupt.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building Monadic DNA explorer, a tool to explore thousands of genetic traits from GWAS Catalog in your browser and plug in your own DNA data from 23andMe, Ancestry, etc. All processing happens locally on your machine and AI insights are run in a private LLM inside a TEE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a modified version of Shopify's CEO Tobi try implementation[0]. It extends his implementation with sandboxing capabilities and designed with functional core, imperative shell in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had success using it to manage multiple coding agents at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was tired of only having 1 or 2 things per newsletter that interested me, multiplied by however many newsletters I've subscribed to. Trying to solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea: design newsletter sections on whatever topics you want (football scores, tech news, new restaurants in your area, etc.), choose your tone and length preferences, then get a fully cited digest delivered weekly to your inbox. Completely automated after initial setup (but you can refine it anytime).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have the architecture sorted and a pretty good dev plan, but collecting interest before I invest a ton of time into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to get a new release of Video Hub App - my 7+ years passion project to browse videos from local storage in style. Maybe will finally finish the (optional!) facial recognition feature I started 5+ years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s fast, free, keyboard-only, cross-platform, and add-free. It’s been my only source of music for the past 6 months or so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sharing the link because of music copyright issues. But I think more people should do that, to break free of the yoke of greedy music platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I create channels that play tracks in a defined order, on repeat, but with a duration of at least 80 hours (and ever-growing). Old-school album-based listening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I think learning of new stuff is twisted in the current environment. "New stuff" in the sense of radio/Spotify is mostly "same stuff as I know and like, but slightly different so it feels new". You don’t discover truly new stuff unless by actively searching for it. No radio or service is going to passively do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://ivyreader.com I am working on my RSS Reader/Podcast player. I am currently searching and patching all the little bugs, fixing the ui and creating the landingpage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eidetica is a decentralized database project that I've been working on that is finally in a somewhat usable state. It basically wraps CRDTs into a close to normal Database interface, with decentralized authentication, background sync, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lpviz is like Desmos, but for linear programming - I've implemented a few LP solvers in Typescript and hooked them up to a canvas so you can draw a feasible region, set an objective direction, and see how the algorithms work. And it all runs locally, in the browser!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you go to https://lpviz.net/?demo it should show you a short tour of the features/how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's by no means complete but I figured there may be some fellow optimization enthusiasts here who might be interested to take a look :) Super open to feedback, feature requests, comments!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on: to teach myself Rust, I’ve been working on a NYT Letter Boxed solver, with some ambitions to turn it into a game by itself. I think this game could be made a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking about: A new take on LinkedIn/web-of-trust, bootstrapped by in-person interactions with devices. It seems that the problem of proving who is actually human and getting a sense of how your community values you might be getting more important, and now devices have some new tools to bring that within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make manual focus work on my Lenovo tablet. Everything seems ok, onCaptureStarted shows focal distance set to 5 diopters yet the camera takes photo at infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My partner and I are working on Supabird.io (https://supabird.io), a tool to help people grow on X in a more consistent and structured way. It analyzes viral posts within specific communities so users can learn what works and apply those insights to their own content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My partner shares our journey on X (@hustle_fred), while I’ve been focused on building the product (yep, the techie here :). We’re excited to have onboarded 43 users in our first month, and we're looking forward to getting feedback from the HN community!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Debtmap - An open source Rust-based code complexity analyzer that tells you exactly which code to refactor and which code to test for maximum impact. Combines complexity metrics with test coverage data to identify the riskiest code in your codebase. Uses entropy analysis to reduce false positives by distinguishing genuinely complex code from repetitive patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently working on Note Cargo, basically self-hosted Markdown note-taking app, but I tried to not using database. So similar to Obsidian/Logseq but its web-based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And currently working to make things shareable, also don't want to use database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it says OneNote but does it also support stylus handwriting, links, tables, images? id love a onenote replacement but these features are what makes me stick to onenote&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Reflect [0], it’s a private self discovery and self experimentation app. You can track metrics, set goals, get alerted to anomalies, view correlations, visualize your data, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a simple NPM package that produces colorful avatars from input data to aid with quick visual verification. I’d like to see it adopted as a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intercom is awful. There is a huge market here, and chatwoot haven’t done a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our company would love a well designed chat button linked to Slack, combined with a helpdesk that supports email queries and also allows people to raise issues via the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it, that’s all we need. Happy to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to express how badly intercom is designed and engineered. It’s also very expensive and constantly upsold, despite being rubbish. If no one fixes this it will be my next startup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too many companies have gone down the road of “AI support”, without understanding that AI must rest on the foundation of great infrastructure. Intercom are pushing their AI so hard it’s absolutely infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on building a local delivery service using electric cargo bikes in NYC: https://hudsonshipping.co. We are planning to launch our first pilot in early 2026 with our first customers in Brooklyn. We've built all of the tech in-house to manage the fleet, deliveries and optimize our routes. If you know of anyone that would like to be a part of the pilot program, feel free to reach out to me!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you using api's to get the jobs or are you scraping all of the sites? I'm new to scraping and trying to do something similar for a different career vertical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haunted house trope, but it's a chatbot. Not done yet, but it's going well. The only real blocker is that I ran into the parental controls on the commercial models right away when trying to make gory images, so I had to spin up my own generators. (Compositing by hand definitely taking forever).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm expanding my computational biology toolkit in rust. Of recent interest is optimizing long-range molecular dynamics forces on GPU and SIMD, adding support to generate lipid membranes and LNPs, and a 3D small molecule editor with integrated dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on https://edugram.live to make learning fun like a social media feed. Planning to build an insta like mobile app feed on top of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am playing at creating a FTP interface for all file transfer protocols (including the Dropbox API) so we can settle the argument of the infamous top comment of the Dropbox launch: https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just brought an IFR 2947a communications service monitor back from the dead. It's amazing how much functionality that you can pack into about 6U of rack space. I was testing it out, and detecting signals down to 0.1 uV on the spectrum analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been gathering up the supplies to set up a proper radio/computer repair workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on that thing the world really needs - yet another javascript framework. The code is all in the repo for my app though. Hopefully I can break it out into it's own repo to share by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on the finishing touches for my first bigger game, created and published entirely by myself! It's a pixelly courier-adventure, questioning the pace of our modern world a little bit: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3644970/Fading_Serenades/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Done with Godot in just 7-8 months, it's fun how fast you can create things when you really focus on something :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shipping pets and animals across borders is a big problem, and we are building the operating system to solve it at scale. If you are a vet (or work in the veterinary space), we would love to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent the last few months working on a custom RL model for coding tasks. The biggest headache has been the lack of good tooling for tuning the autorater's prompt. (That's the judge that gives the training feedback.) The process is like any other quality-focused task—running batch rating jobs and doing SxS evaluations—but the tooling really falls short. I think I'll have to build my own tools once I wrap up the current project&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ive got a couple ai scripts on the go, and i want to see if i can get the inference to run on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. is something that can poll a bunch of websites workshop/events pages to see if theres any new events [my mother] wants to go to and send a digest to her email&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. is a poller to look up the different safeway/coop/save on flyers and so on to see whats on sale between the different places, then send a mail with some recipes it found based on those ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im most of the way through 1, but havent started on 2 yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bash scripts that make terraform configurations for scaling bioinfo work to n h100s/a100s spot vms with resistance to the vms getting terminated. i now have it for alphafold3 jobs but i need to make the same for boltz, gnina, gromacs (although spot vms do not make sense here), etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;next step is to make a simple login portal for non trusted persons to be able to submit work as this a uni project, mail the result / process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://videotobe.com a audio/video transcription service. VideoToBe started as a user friendly Whisper wrapper — but is evolving into a full pipeline that extracts, summarizes, and structures insights from multimedia content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a new layer of hyper-personalization over the web. Instead of generating more content, it helps you reformat and interact with what already exists, turning any page, paper, or YouTube video into a summary, mind-map, podcast, infographic or chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The broader idea is to make the web adaptive to how each person thinks and learns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duckyscript is a language for the USB rubber ducky that costs approximately 100$. A usb rubber ducky is an usb key that gets recognized as a keyboard and that starts typing text and shortcuts automatically once you plug it to anything. To specify to the key what to type, you can use duckyscript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using circuitpython. The last thing I did was to de-recursify the interpreter with a stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more I'm implementing of duckyscript, the more i think that i should create my own language. Duckyscript sucks as a language...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a website that lets you browse Pokemon ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names, view their registration statuses and recent sales. It's a small but engaged niche&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An implementation of statecharts. I'm working through core functionality using recursive algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered that "least common ancestor" boils down to the intersection of 'root-path' sets, where you select the last item in the set as the 'first/least common ancestor'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On-site surveys for eCommerce and SaaS. It's been an amazing ride leveling up back and forth between product, design, and marketing. Marketing is way more involved than most people on this site realize...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main idea is to bring as many of the agentic tools and features into a single cohesive platform as much as possible so that we can unlock more useful AI use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I needed to let off steam regarding Chatcontrol, so I created a little site, where people can post and comment while sitting on the toilet since we take our smartphones everywhere with us, right? It surely is not influencial but it gave me a good time and a better feeling. https://shitcontrol.eu/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Headbang, a rhythm game that you play by bobbing your head while wearing Airpods while listening to music, is what I'm considering building next. The idea came from someone else using Airpods to create a racing game (RidePods).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Headbang concept sounds really fun, I'd love to play that as a fan of rhythm games, but wow my neck would hate me I think. I am no George Fisher in that regard&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on my lisp. I recently added delimited continuations, even wrote a blog post about it. Now I'm working on adding more control primitives. Just finished researching generators. I'm going to implement them as a separate interpreter of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Many say they want to stop doomscrolling and clout-chasing but I don't know how many are actually willing to do so&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Individuals may move here but their friends won't. So the feed will be initially empty by design. Introducing any kind of reward is against our ethos so we are clueless about how to convince existing friend circles to move.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may work in your favour - it's one of the reasons I enjoy Mastodon so much - friction is/was a little higher which kept my network small but focussed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a better way to make design comparisons for electronics engineers. Starting with ceramic capacitors for now but expanding to other components types soon. www.get-merlin.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm, a personal assistant of sorts that does evaluation of you to get to the bottom of who you really are. For very obvious reasons, it is a local only project and not exactly intended for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond that, just regular random stuff that comes up here and there, but, for once, my hdd with sidelined projects is slowly being worked through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An application that helps deaf and nonverbal individuals with daily interactions when they’re out and about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first career was in sales. And most of the time these interactions began with grabbing a sheet of paper and writing to one another. I think small LLMs can help here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently making use of api’s but I think small models on phones will be good enough soon. Just completed my MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a paper about solving the Royal Game of Ur, one of the world's oldest board games. We solved it a while ago, and are now trying to get more formal about it (https://royalur.net/solved).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a workout tracker that you can actually use for things like TRX and gymnastic rings. Along with normal workouts too. Let me know if there's anything you'd like on there. https://gravitygainsapp.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A React Three Fiber-based avatar engine with speech synthesis, voice automation, and real-time interaction with tools such as Home Assistant, n8n, and LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working away at https://TempMailDetector.com, a privacy focused disposable email detection API which only requires the domain part and not the user part of the email. The service is able to determine if a domain is likely a disposable email, a forwarding service, and actively crawls for new domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mobile app that checks my email to find and extract family-related events/activities. The kind of things that are buried in a 12-point bullet list with font 8, inside of one of 10 school email messages received during the week&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It runs fully on-device, including email classification and event extraction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a job board for AI jobs and companies. The job market in AI is pretty hot right now, and there are a lot of cool AI companies out there. I'm hoping to connect job seekers with fast-growing AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AppGoblin is a free place to do app research for understanding which apps use which companies to monetize, track where data is sent and what kinds of ads are shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a course for a customer on how to use Claude Code well, especially around brownfield development (working on existing code bases, not so much around vibe-coding something new).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a mod for the game Subway Builder (http://subwaybuilder.com) that lets me undo/redo individual stations and tracks, instead of clearing all blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should also point out - if you download the current version, you should immediately apply the update that will pop up. And even then, you're results may be flakey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While working on Shelvica, a personal library management service and reading tracker, I realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I started working on Librario, an ISBN database that fetches information from several other services, such as Hardcover.app, Google Books, and ISBNDB, merges that information, and return something more complete than using them alone. It also saves that information in the database for future lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see an example response here[1]. Pricing information for books is missing right now because I need to finish the extractor for those, genres need some work[2], and having a 5 months old baby make development a tad slow, but the service is almost ready for a preview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm to decide what to merge is the hardest part, in my opinion, and very basic right now. It's based on a priority and score system for now, where different extractors have different priorities, and different fields have different scores. Eventually, I wanna try doing something with machine learning instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd also like to add book summaries to the data somehow, but I haven't figured out a way to do this legally yet. For books in the public domain I could feed the entire book to an LLM and ask them to write a spoiler-free summary of the book, but for other books, that'd land me in legal trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and related books, and things of the sort. But I'd like to do that based on the information stored in the database itself instead of external sources, so it's something for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last time I posted about Shelvica some people showed interest in Librario instead, so I decided to make it something I can sell instead of just a service I use in Shelvica[3], hence why I'm focusing more on it these past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[2]: In the example you'll see genres such as "English" and "Fiction In English", which is mostly noise. Also things like "Humor", "Humorous", and "Humorous Fiction" for the same book.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[3]: Which is nice, cause that way there are two possible sources of income for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://JobBoardSearch.com a meta directory of job boards helping job site owners with their DR, visibility, jobs cross posting and promoting in general&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is built with Rust, egui and SQLite3. The app has a downloader for NSE India reports. These are the daily end of day stock prices. Out of the box the app is really fast, which is expected but still surprises me. I am going to work on improving the stocks chart. I also want to add an AI assisted stocks analyst. Since all the stocks data is on the SQLite3 DB, I should be able to express my stocks screening ideas as plain text and let an LLM generate the SQL and show me in my data grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was really interesting to generate it within 3 days. I had just a few places where I had to copy from app (std) log and paste into my prompt. Most of the time just describing the features was enough. Rust compiler did most of the heavy lifting. I have used a mix of Claude Code and OpenCode (with either GLM 4.5 or Grok Code Fast 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been generating full-stack web apps. I built and launched https://github.com/brainless/letsorder (https://letsorder.app/). Building full-stack web apps is basically building 2 apps (at a minimum) so desktop apps are way better it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the long-term, I plan to build and help others generated apps. I am building a vibe coding platform (https://github.com/brainless/nocodo). I have a couple early stage founders I consult for who take my guidance to generate their products (web and mobile apps + backend).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently running some finetuning experiments on non-verbal sounds to teach TTS how to laugh. I have had some success to add the necessary tags and tokens to multiple systems, but assembling the necessary dataset with sufficient quality is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a pen plotter machine that is purpose built for multi-color artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I have a duet mainboard wired up to motors and a commercial gantry set (openbuilds). I've figured out how to wire up a servo control board to a GPIO pin, and the gcode necessary run the servo up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm designing and 3d printing parts for the pen gantry, I have a nice rail / slider setup using linear bearings. I'm almost done working out how the pen holder fits into my gantry setup but I'm struggling a little bit getting this past the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I already figured out how to generate custom GCODE that takes into account the needs of having no z axis. I need to make a simple web interface that lets me interact with the duet over USB, and this will be running off a raspi. This will allow me more GPIO and flexibility vs just wiring buttons straight to the duet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I already have some code and logic to generate trace data from bitmap images, I just need to figure out a way to automate it so that the output still looks nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to create technology that is indistinguishable from magic. People without the technical understanding of what's going on will just see it as tech junk, but my hope is that by breaking down all the individual parts it will allow people to learn about CNC machines, vector vs raster and what it means for something to actually be a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still have zero idea how to make money with this. Career is struggling really badly but I am hopeful that what I am working on will allow me to display competency and skill to an employer. That's the fantasy at least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on an AI governance and security platform that gives security and GRC visibility into what AI tools people are actually using but also what is going into them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a browser extension right now and the platform integrates with SSO providers and AI APIs, to help discover shadow AI, enforce policies and creates audit trails. Think observability for AI adoption but also Grammerly since we help coach endusers to better behavior/outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early days but the problem is real, have a few design partners in the F500 already&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Camera Search (camerasearch.ai) is my iOS app for tradespeople and DIY users. It combines voice, video, image understanding, and chat—backed by tuned LLM API—to help diagnose issues and guide builds/repairs in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a tool to help California home owners to lower their property taxes. This works for people who bought in the past years low interest environment and are overpaying in taxes because of that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I just tried your app and after providing my email the analysis I get is for a completely different address than what I entered. I tried twice just to make sure the address i entered was right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you guys think of this? https://www.textaurant.app. It's an AI "agentic" SMS ordering system that's hopefully better than Taco Bell's attempt... I got sick of navigating every restaurants nuanced online order placing and figured I'd try to standardize it myself with an SMS based assistant (yes I'm aware of the XKCD). The idea is every restaurant would have their own number, or down the road I could have a single number for all restaurants but I'm somewhat token/context limited right now. It uses GPT 4o and I've been working on it for the past 4 months. Closed source for now but who knows I might open it up but I'm deciding if it's worth trying to patent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- hiragana / katakana / number / time reading quizzes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- vocabulary quizzes based on wordlists you define and build&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- learn and practice kanji anki-style (using FSRS algo)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- the coolest feature (imo) is a "reader": upload Japanese texts (light novels, children's books, etc), then translate them to your native language to practice your reading comprehension. Select text anywhere on the page (with your cursor) to instantly do a dictionary lookup. A LLM evaluates your translation accuracy (0..100%) and suggests other possible interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just revamped the UI look and feel the other day after implementing some other user feedback! I'm now exploring ads as a way to monetize it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any chance you'll take a look at power tools next?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some Amish people who rebuild Dewalt, Milwaukee etc battery packs. I'd like a repairable/sustainable platform where I can actually check the health of the battery packs and replace worn out cells as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of the market, original batteries are about $149, and their knockoffs are around $100.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very nice, looking forward to a deal with Décath' ;) How hard is it to make it compatible with the various motors when there is communication involved?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been wondering for a while if the display on ebikes could also be a more open and durable part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on securing software against backdoors and hidden exploits using a set of debloating tools. First one available here: github.com/negativa-ai/BLAFS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on dev tools for MCP servers. As a building block I recently published a library to help write tests for MCPs - https://facetlayer.github.io/expect-mcp/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;new PostgreSQL index type which outperforms B-Trees for many common cases. As a wild experiment, I'm entirely vibe coding this and not hand-writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works by specializing for the common case of read-only workloads and short, fixed-length keys/includes (int, uuid, text&amp;lt;=32b, numeric, money, etc - not json) and (optionally) repetitive key-values (a common case with short fixed-length keys). These kinds of indexes/tables are found in nearly every database for lookups, many-many JOIN relationships, materialized views of popular statistics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, it's "starting to work" with 100% code coverage and performance that usually matches/beats btree in query speed. Due to compression, it can consume as little as 99.95% less memory (!) and associated "pressure" on cache/ram/IO. Of course, there are degenerate cases (e.g. all unique UUID, many INCLUDEs, etc) where it's about the same size. As with all indexes, performance is limited by the PostgreSQL executor's interface which is record-at-a-time with high overhead records. I'd love help coding a FDW which allows aggregates (e.g. count()) to be "pushed down" and executed in still requires returning every record instead of a single final answer. OTT help would be a FDW interface where substantial query plans could be "pushed down" e.g. COUNT().&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plan is to publish and open source this work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd welcome collaborators and have lots of experience working on small teams at major companies. I'm based in NYC but remote is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- must be willing to work with LLMs and not "cheat" by hand-writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Usage testing: must be comfortable with PostgreSQL and indexes. No other experience required!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Benchmarking, must know SQL indexes and have benchmarking experience - no pgsql internals required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- For internals work, must know C and SQL. PostgreSQL is tricky to learn but LLMs are excellent teachers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Scripting code is in bash, python and Makefile, but again this is all vibe coded and you can ask LLMs what it's doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- any environment is fine. I'm using linux/docker (multi-core x86 and arm) but would love help with Windows, native MacOS and SIMD optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I'm open to porting/moving to Rust, especially if that provides a faster path to restricted environments like AWS RDS/Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- your ideas welcome! but obviously, we'll need to divide and conquer since the LLMs are making rapid changes to the core and we'll have to deal with code conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little library to define functions in English (through LLM of course; for TypeScript initially) and use these functions like ordinary (async) functions (calling &amp;amp; be called). Agents as functions and multi-step concurrent orchestration of agents with event loops, if fanciness is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And an agentic news digest service which scrapes a few sources (like HackerNews) for technical news and create a daily digest, which you can instruct and skew with words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on ServBay, a local development environment I built to end the constant pain of juggling different versions of program languages like Python, PHP, Node.js, Golang, Rust and so on, databases, and local SSL certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an all-in-one toolkit with one-click version switching, automatic HTTPS for local domains, and an integrated mail catcher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've just rolled out some major updates: 1. Local AI Deployment: Now can run models like Llama 3 &amp;amp; Code Llama directly within ServBay. 2. Built-in Tunneling: Share the local sites with anyone on the internet, ngrok-style or frp or Cloudflare. 3. Windows is Live! The new Windows version is out and quickly reaching feature parity with our macOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next up is ServBay 2.0. I'm currently gathering feedback on features like deeper Docker integration and more flexible site configurations. I'd love to hear what the HN community thinks is important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a HubSpot marketplace app that will detect tasks and not create them if there are duplicates and workflows. Does anyone want to help me who's using HubSpot?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;trying to build some opportunity for the VR/XR community with https://vr.dev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;right now, it’s a better way to showcase your really specific industry skills and portfolio of 3D assets (i.e., “LinkedIn for VR/XR) with hiring layered on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;starting to add onto the current perf analysis tools and think more about how to get to a “lovable for VR/XR”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(you could fix your link so it's clickable) 1. thanks for building this. I will get back on my iron deficiency diet. I now understand it takes over 7 weeks to reliably fix 2. when doing data input, I'm lazy, especially for the blood age calc. So my process is: upload list + my blood results to the LLM and spit out the list of values I need (terrible privacy job right here for me) but anyway, I wonder if you could offer another route for data input, like a text field, with the full list and empty values, that I could copy to an LLM and ask to populate with my results and then spit back to paste into the form. Keep up the good work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a original algorithm to explain human behavior from 3rd person perspective (1st stage). The whole research is divided into 6 stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2nd stage, I will mathematically establish the best course of action as an individual given the base theory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 3rd stage, I will explain common psychological phenomenon through the theory, things like narcissism, anxiety, self-doubt, how to forgive others, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 4th stage, I will explain how the theory is the fastest way to learn across multiple domains and anyone can become a generalist and critical thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 5th stage, I will explain how society will unfold if everyone can become generalist and critical thinker through the theory. And how this is the next big societal breakthrough like Industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 6th and last stage, I will think about how to use this theory to make India the next superpower, as this theory can give us the demographic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've struggled with adding evals to my AI agents for last few months, and felt that vibe evals should have a path to building a robust system down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a plugin for langfuse to create evals functions and dataset from ingested traces automatically, based on ad-hoc user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fucking 16bit robot controller in the Australian outback. Because the contractor who provided the robot didn't provide a proper PLC, nor a controller. And hitting your target with 16bit on 80m sounds like a moonlander&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on mTOR (https://mtor.club), a free, science-based workout tracker I built to automate progressive overload. It's a local-first PWA that works completely offline, syncs encrypted between your devices using, passwordless passkeys, and allows for plan sharing via a simple link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is to make progression easier to track and follow. After a workout, it analyzes your performance (weight, reps, and RIR), highlights new personal records (PRs), and generates specific targets for your next session. It also reviews your entire program to provide scientific analysis on weekly volume, frequency, and recovery for each muscle group. This gets displayed visually on an anatomy model to help you learn which muscles are involved, and you can track your gains over time with historical performance charts for each exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a workout, you get a total session timer, an automatic rest timer, and can see your performance from the last session for a clear target to beat. It automatically advances to the next incomplete exercise, and when you need to swap an exercise, it provides context-aware alternatives targeting the same muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also deeply customizable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- The UI has a dark theme, supports multiple languages (English, Spanish, German), lets you adjust the UI scale, and toggle the visibility of detailed muscle names, exercise types, historical performance badges, and a full history card. - You can set global defaults for weight units (kg/lbs), rest times, and plan targets, or enable/disable metrics like Reps in Reserve (RIR) and estimated 1-Rep Max. The exercise library can be filtered by your available equipment, you can create your own custom exercises with global notes, and there's a built-in weight plate calculator. - The progression system lets you define default rep ranges and RIR targets, or create specific overrides for different lifts (e.g., a 3-5 rep range for strength, 10-15 for accessories). - Editing is flexible: you can drag-and-drop to reorder days, exercises, and sets, duplicate workout days, track unilateral exercises (left/right side), and enter data with a quick wheel picker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to workout at least the minimum amount but always end up procrastinating it ... for some fortunate ones (me) it only takes like 20 min. a day to keep a good shape, with stuff you can do at home. We all know this but for many somehow it never happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to keep a tally of the push ups I do every day (and squats, etc...). I decided to gamify it, but not in a crappy way. I would like to see my streaks (kind of like how Github shows commits) and how other friends are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now is prototype v0.0.0.0.0.1 as you can see, no UI and the push up detector actually kind of detects squats, lol, but I'm working on it. Btw, the push up detector is client side only so rest assured I never get see your video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a global push up count, an aggregate of all push ups everyone does on the site, right now is linked to a button so it's more like a clicker, feel free to exercise your fingers. I figured it would be super nice if one day we can do like a million push ups collaboratively, or just looking at it going up in real-time, meaning somebody else is working out, should get myself inspired to do some as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please leave your feedback and yeah you can join the Push Up Club anytime :D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently building out an application to help me allocate project funding in an academic setting to contracts and scientific staff. It'll be for internal use first, depending on my motivation I might release it at one point. The main features will be the management of split contracts (30% project A, 70% project B), pay grade progressions (German system), handling of unique spending and budget requirements from funding agencies (also for now only Germany + EU Funding), and reporting features for internal planning. I am not a computer scientist, so we will see how this goes and if it can replace the currently used disgusting excel sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube's algorithm is all about engagement - more video game videos, more brainrot, their algorithm doesn't care about the content as long as the kid is watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My system allows parents to define their children's interests (e.g., a 12-year-old who enjoys DIY engineering projects, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and drawing fantasy figures)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.. and specify how the AI should filter video candidates (e.g., excluding YouTube Shorts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Periodically, the system prompts the child with something like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Tell me about your favorite family vacation."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And their response to that prompt provides the system with more ideas and interests to suggest videos to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;email me if you'd like to test jim.jones1@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iOS/Mac app for learning Japanese by reading, all in one solution with optional Anki integration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went full-time on this a couple years ago. I’m now doing a full iOS 26 redesign, just added kanji drawing, and am almost done adding a manga mode via Mokuro. I’m also preparing influencer UGC campaigns as I haven’t marketed it basically at all yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://revise.io - a new word processor with live collaboration, git-like revision history, and an AI agent like Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, an agentic platform for working with rich text documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been building this solo since May and having so much fun with it. I created a canvas renderer and all of the word processor interactions from scratch so I can have maximum control over how things are display when it comes to features like AI suggestions and other more novel features I have planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on revamping our calculator page on Levels.fyi to make it more useful to see refreshers and stock growth over time. Check it out at https://levels.fyi/calculator/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think getting a clear picture about what it is about yourself that needs work is actually a lot of the real work. Much of the rest of it is picking a direction and then living in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am still [0] working on trying to recover who I was before whatever -- a couple of years ago -- rendered me progressively unable to concentrate on anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month was an improvement. This month I can't concentrate for long and I distract very easily, but I seem to be able to do more with what I have, A small sense of ambition that I might be able to do bigger things, and might not need to drop out of tech and get a simple job, is returning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am trying to use this inhibited, fractured state to clarify thoughts about useless technology and distractions, and about what really matters, because (without wishing to sound haughty) I used to be unusually good at a lot of tech stuff, and now I am not. It is sobering but it is also an insight into what it might be like to be on the outside of technology bullshit, looking in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kind of have been wasting time with Cloudflare workers engine. Trying to build a system that schedules these workers for a lightweight alternative to GitHub actions. If you are interested in WASM feel free to reach out. Looking to connect with other developers working on the WASM space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://run-phx.com ... a guide to trail running in the Valley of the Sun with notable routes, curated by actual human beings in the running community. (whoa)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not earth shattering, but something that should exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prove my expertise in anything from infrastructure, over backend to frontend, I learned how to use terraform to provision a managed kubernetes cluster (on oracle clouds excellent free forever tier).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently developing a web app consisting of a spring/kotlin backend for an angular frontend that is meant to provide a UI for kubectl. It has oAuth login and allows you to store several kubernetes configs, select which one to use and makes it unnecessary to remember all the kubectl commands I can never remember.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's what I'd like to have if I had to interact with a kubernetes cluster at work. Yes, I know there are several kubernetes UIs already, but remember, this is for 1) learning and 2) following through and completing a project at least somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been trying to study Chinese on my own for a while now and found it very frustrating to spend half the time just looking for simple content to read and listen to. Apps and websites exist, but they usually only have very little content or they ramp up the difficulty too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that LLMs and TTS are quite good I wanted to try it out for languages learning. The goal is to create a vast number of short AI-generated stories to bridge the gap between knowing a few characters and reading real content in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious to see if it is possible to automatically create stories which are comfortable to read for beginners, or if they sound too much like AI-slop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom rack mount enclosure for the low-cost metal 3D printer controller, and debugging slicer software in Blender geometry nodes. Had to abandon classic CAM format export as the complexity of the tooling ballooned for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still reducing design costs of a micro positing stage for hobbyists. I observed the driver motion was mostly synchronous and symmetric... Accordingly, given the scale only a single multiplexed piezoelectric actuator motor driver was actually needed, and cut that part of the design cost by 75%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still designing various test platforms to validate other key technologies. Sorry, no spoilers =3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I've been working on a CLI tool [1] for my WebASM UI library [2] with the idea that all the gluecode generating stuff is abstracted away in nice CLI wizards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially like yeoman back then, to bootstrap your webapp and all the necessary files more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I am somewhat stuck because of Go's type system, as the UI components require a specific interface for the Dataset or Data/Record entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, a Pie chart would require a map[string]number which could be a float, percentage string or an integer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Line chart would require a slice of map[string]number, where each slice index would represent a step in the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A table would require a slice of map[string]any where each slice index would represent a step in the culling, but the data types would require a custom rendering method or Stringifier(?) of sorts attached to the data type. So that it's possible to serialize or deserialize the properties (e.g. yes/no in the UI meaning true/false, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I want to provide UI components that can use whatever struct the developer provides, the Go way would be to use an interface. But that would imply that all data type structs on the backend side would have this type of clutter on them attached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No idea if something like a Parser and Stringifier method definition would make more sense for the UI components here...or whether or not it's better to have something like a Render method attached per component that does all the stringifying on a per-property basis like a "func(dataset any, index int, column string) string" where the developer needs to do all the typecasting manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manual typecasting like this would be pretty painful as components then cannot exist in pure HTML serialized form, which is essentially the core value proposition of my whole UI components framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alternative would be offering a marshal/unmarshal API similar to how JSON does it, but that would require the reflect package which bloats up the runtime binary by several MB and wouldn't be tinygo compatible, so I heavily would wanna avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently looking for other libraries and best practices, as this issue is really bugging me a lot in the app I'm currently building [3] and it's a pretty annoying type system problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feedback as to how it's solved in other frameworks or languages would be appreciated. Maybe there's an architectural convention I'm not aware of that could solve this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been building OpenRun, a declarative web app deployment platform https://github.com/openrundev/openrun. It is an open source alternative to Google Cloud Run and AWS App Runner, running on your own hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRun allows defining your web app configuration in a declarative config using Starlark (which is like a subset of Python). Setting up a full GitOps workflow is just one command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will set up a scheduled sync, which will look for new apps in the config and create them. It will also apply any config updates on existing apps and reload apps with the latest source code. After this, no further CLI operations are required, all updates are done declaratively. For containerized apps, OpenRun will directly talk to Docker/Podman to manage the container build and startup. There are lots of tools which simplify web app deployment. Most of them use a UI driven approach or an imperative CLI approach. That makes it difficult to recreate an environment. Managing these tools when multiple people need to coordinate changes is also difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any repo which has a Dockerfile can be deployed directly. For frameworks like Streamlit/Gradio/FastHTML/Shiny/Reflex/Flask/FastAPI, OpenRun supports zero-config deployments, there is no need to even have a Dockerfile. Domain based deployment is supported for all apps. Path based deployment is also supported for most frameworks, which makes DNS routing and certificate management easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRun currently runs on a single machine with an embedded SQLite database or on multiple machines with an external Postgres database. I plan to support OpenRun as a service on top of Kubernetes, to support auto-scaling. OpenRun implements its own web server, instead of using Traefik/Nginx. That makes it possible to implement features like scaling down to zero and RBAC. The goal with OpenRun is to support declarative deployment for web apps while removing the complexity of maintaining multiple YAML config files. See https://github.com/openrundev/openrun/blob/main/examples/uti... for an example config, each app is just one or two lines of config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRun makes it easy to set up OAuth/OIDC/SAML based auth, with RBAC. See https://openrun.dev/docs/use-cases/ for a couple of use cases examples: sharing apps with family and sharing across a team. Outside of managed services, I have found it difficult to implement this type of RBAC with any other open source solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a set of TypeScript libraries to make it really really easy to spin up an agent, or an chatbot, or pretty much anything else you want to prototype. It's based around sensible interfaces, and while batteries are included, they're also meant to be removed when you've got something you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that a beginner should be able to wire up a personally useful agent (like a file-finder for your computer) in ten minutes by writing a simple prompt, some simple tools, and running it. Easy to plugin any kind of tracing, etc you want. Have three or four projects in prod which I'll be switching to use it just to make sure it fits all those use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I want to be able to go from someone saying "can we build an agent to" to having the PoC done in a few minutes. Everything else I've looked at so far seems limited, or complicated, or insufficiently hackable for niche use-cases. Or, worse of all, in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a card game for android, it's being built with Monogame and C#. It's just go fish at the moment, but I'm thinking of expanding it into a full suite of card games like solitaire and poker. The source is available on GitHub if anyone wants to poke around and perhaps collaborate. https://github.com/joshsiegl1/GoFishRefresh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tool for threshold signing software releases that I eventually want to integrate with SigStore, etc. to help folks distribute their code-signing. https://github.com/soatok/freeon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want E2EE for Mastodon (and other ActivityPub-based software), so you can have encrypted Fediverse DMs? I've been working on the public key transparency aspect of this too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an AI-webapp builder with a twist: I proxy all OpenAI API calls your webapp makes and charge 2x the token rate; so when you publish your webapp onto a subdomain, the users who use your webapp will be charged 2x on their token usage. Then you, the webapp creator, gets 80% of what's left over after I pay OpenAI (and I get 20%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also a fun project because I'm making code changes a different way than most people are: I'm having the LLM write AST modification code; My site immediately runs the code spit out by the LLM in order to make the changes you requested in a ticket. I blogged about how this works here: https://codeplusequalsai.com/static/blog/prompting_llms_to_m...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building an open source NAT traversal and networking framework called P2PD. Built from the ground up to allow things like multi-network interface applications, improved network programming in Python, and if people want it: an easy way to bypass NATs. The thing is: it depends on public servers for some of this which tends to change a lot, causing errors when they're all down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I'm building at the moment is a server monitoring solution for STUN, TURN, MQTT, and NTP servers. I wanted to allow the software for this to be portable. So I wrote a simple work queue myself. Python doesn't have linked-lists which is the data structure I'm using for the queues. They allow for O(1) deletes which you can't really get on many Python data structures. Important for work items when you're moving work between queues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the actual workers I keep things very simple. I make like 100 independent Python processes each with an event loop. This uses up a crap load of memory but the advantage is that you can parallel execution without any complexity. It would be extremely complex trying to do that with code alone and asyncio's event loop doesn't play well with parallelism. So you really only want one per process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Result: simple, portable Python code that can easily manage monitoring hundreds of servers (sorry didnt mean for that to sound like chatgpt, lmao, incidental.) The DB for this is memory-based to avoid locking issues. I did use sqlite at first but even with optimizations there were locking issues. Now, I only use sqlite for import / export (checksums.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;yet another nvr (in python). also trying to make a switch for hpm style rocker light switches. these things are devilish. the switch requires a lot of force at a strange angle but i dont want to break it so knowing nothing about mechanical stuff ive had to learn about slip clutches, idling gears, worm gears, ratchet wheels. rack and pinions (ofc. from a hobbyist perspective). i know theres a switchbot and a fingerbot but neither of those will work with that type of switch unless you tape some sort of torque lever onto the light (which i dont want to do). its a rabbit hole :/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a breakdown of the projects people are working on, with AI-related projects in their own category:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Cryptography and Security&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 4 Oct 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:You Have Been LaTeXpOsEd: A Systematic Analysis of Information Leakage in Preprint Archives Using Large Language Models&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:The widespread use of preprint repositories such as arXiv has accelerated the communication of scientific results but also introduced overlooked security risks. Beyond PDFs, these platforms provide unrestricted access to original source materials, including LaTeX sources, auxiliary code, figures, and embedded comments. In the absence of sanitization, submissions may disclose sensitive information that adversaries can harvest using open-source intelligence. In this work, we present the first large-scale security audit of preprint archives, analyzing more than 1.2 TB of source data from 100,000 arXiv submissions. We introduce LaTeXpOsEd, a four-stage framework that integrates pattern matching, logical filtering, traditional harvesting techniques, and large language models (LLMs) to uncover hidden disclosures within non-referenced files and LaTeX comments. To evaluate LLMs' secret-detection capabilities, we introduce LLMSec-DB, a benchmark on which we tested 25 state-of-the-art models. Our analysis uncovered thousands of PII leaks, GPS-tagged EXIF files, publicly available Google Drive and Dropbox folders, editable private SharePoint links, exposed GitHub and Google credentials, and cloud API keys. We also uncovered confidential author communications, internal disagreements, and conference submission credentials, exposing information that poses serious reputational risks to both researchers and institutions. We urge the research community and repository operators to take immediate action to close these hidden security gaps. To support open science, we release all scripts and methods from this study but withhold sensitive findings that could be misused, in line with ethical principles.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdfly&lt;/code&gt; is the youngest project of the &lt;code&gt;py-pdf&lt;/code&gt; organization.
It has been created by Martin Thoma in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's simply a CLI tool to manipulate PDF files, written in Python and based on the fpdf2 &amp;amp; pypdf libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a maintainer of the project 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What can it do?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has meany features, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdfly&lt;/code&gt;can also combine files into new PDF documents: it can extract specific pages &amp;amp; merge documents (&lt;code&gt;pdfly cat&lt;/code&gt;); selectively remove pages (&lt;code&gt;pdfly rm&lt;/code&gt;); convert images to PDF documents (&lt;code&gt;pdfly x2pdf&lt;/code&gt;); and even compress documents (&lt;code&gt;pdfly compress&lt;/code&gt;) or build booklets (&lt;code&gt;pdfly 2-up&lt;/code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;code&gt;pdfly booklet&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdfly&lt;/code&gt;includes some commands to pull out specific content from PDF files:&lt;code&gt;pdfly extract-images&lt;/code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;code&gt;pdfly extract-annotated-text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;sometimes you want to edit a PDF file manually, in a text editor. But when you do so, you break its&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;table, that is an index of byte offsets in the document.&lt;code&gt;pdfly update-offsets&lt;/code&gt;is there to save the day, fixing manually-edited PDF documents, so that they can be opened in a PDF viewer again!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Release 0.5.0 &amp;amp; new features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we released a new version: &lt;code&gt;pdfly release 0.5.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to several contributors, including developers taking part in Hacktoberfest, new exciting features have been added:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdfly sign&lt;/code&gt;allows you to easily sign PDF documents, while&lt;code&gt;pdfly check-sign&lt;/code&gt;makes it easy to check a PDF document signature. Thanks to @moormaster for implementing this in PRs #165 &amp;amp; #166 👍🙏.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdfly extract-annotated-pages&lt;/code&gt;extract only annotated pages from a PDF, hence helping to review or rework pages from a large document iteratively. Thanks to Hal Wine (@hwine) for implementing this in PR #128 👍🙏.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdfly rotate&lt;/code&gt;rotate specific pages of a document. Thanks to Subhajit Sahu (@wolfram77) for implementing this in PR #98 👍🙏.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a bunch of feature ideas: &lt;code&gt;up-for-grabs&lt;/code&gt; issues, including some &lt;code&gt;good first issues&lt;/code&gt; aimed specially at new contributors, that are willing to help but new to open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the &lt;code&gt;pdfly sign&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;check-sign&lt;/code&gt; could become handy to many end-users, and I think we should continue to extend those commands usage options, as described in issue #71.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We would also be happy to get your feedbacks, bug reports &amp;amp; feature suggestions! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After graphene was first produced at the University of Manchester in 2004, it was hailed as a wonder material, stronger than steel but lighter than paper. But two decades on, not every UK graphene company has made the most of that potential. Some show promise but others are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extracted from graphite, commonly used in pencils, graphene is a latticed sheet of carbon one atom thick, and is highly effective at conducting heat and electricity. China is the world’s biggest producer, using it to try to get ahead in the global race to produce microchips and in sectors such as construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the UK, a graphene-enhanced, low-carbon concrete was laid at a Northumbrian Water site in July, developed by the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) at the University of Manchester and Cemex UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The material when it came out of academia was hyped to death … but the challenge is going from lab to fab,” says Ben Jensen, the chief executive of 2D Photonics, a startup spun out from the University of Cambridge that makes graphene-based photonic technology for datacentres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jensen also invented Vantablack coatings, made of carbon nanotubes – rolled-up sheets of graphene – and known as the world’s “blackest black” because it absorbs 99.96% of light, at the UK company Surrey NanoSystems that he founded in 2007. The material’s artistic rights were sold exclusively to the sculptor Anish Kapoor, and BMW used it on its X6 coupe to create the “blackest black car” six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is the challenge when you have new materials trying to displace an incumbent technology,” Jensen says. “The value proposition must be extremely good, but there also must be a way to manufacture the material and manufacture it at scale for the application … then you have to meet price expectations because there’s no point in delivering something that’s costing 10 times more than the incumbent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Germany’s Bayer tried to produce carbon nanotube products in bulk but shut down its pilot factory more than a decade ago after the expected surge in demand failed to materialise. The material is now mainly used as a filler to strengthen plastic products. The company described the potential applications of nanotubes as “fragmented”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More promising are the graphene-based optical microchips developed by 2D Photonics’ subsidiary CamGraPhIC, which are based on research done at the University of Cambridge and Italy’s CNIT research institute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment, silicon-photonics microchips convert electrical data into optical data to transmit it through fibre-optic cables, but the firm says its graphene chips deliver more data in the same period of time and at far lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They consume 80% less energy and can operate in a much wider range of temperatures, reducing the need for costly water- and energy-hungry cooling systems for AI datacentres.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sending data via silicon also causes delays. Jensen compares it to a 16-lane motorway that suddenly narrows to a single lane because of roadworks, forcing everything to slow down. Graphene photonics, he says, are like a motorway with hundreds of lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What we’ve solved is the ability to grow consistent ultra high-performance graphene and to build it into a device,” he says. “And don’t forget, this is a material that’s one atom thick. It’s insanely difficult to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CamGraPhIC was founded in 2018 by the Cambridge nanotechnology professor Andrea Ferrari, who also runs the Cambridge graphene centre, and Marco Romagnoli, who leads advanced photonics at CNIT in Pisa and is the startup’s chief scientific officer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its parent, 2D Photonics, has just secured funding of £25m from backers including Italy’s sovereign wealth fund, Nato and Sony innovation funds, Bosch Ventures and the UK’s Frontier IP Group, and uses a former Pirelli photonics research site in Pisa. It plans to create a pilot manufacturing site in the Milan area to produce 200mm-wide wafers at scale, and is confident of obtaining the necessary funding of €317m (£276m) by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from datacentres, the company’s chips can be used in high-performance computing, 5G and 6G mobile data systems, aircraft systems, autonomous cars, advanced digital radar and satellite-free space communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paragraf, a University of Cambridge spinout based in the nearby village of Somersham, has also fared well over the past decade with backing from the UK Treasury. It produces graphene-based electronic devices, including sensors for electric cars, and biosensors for the early detection of disease and other uses in healthcare and agriculture. It recently secured $55m (£41m) from investors including the United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund, which took a 12.8% stake in Paragraf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more recent startup, Graphene Innovations Manchester, launched in 2021 by Vivek Koncherry, struck a deal with Saudi Arabia last December for the world’s first commercial production of graphene-enriched carbon fibre, used in construction for roofs and facades, as well as street light poles. It has started making it in Tabuk with a local partner, and says it is on track to produce 3,000 tonnes by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other businesses, however, have found the going tougher. One of the sector’s first companies was Applied Graphene Materials, founded by Prof Karl Coleman in 2010 and spun out from Durham University. It launched a number of products including an anti-corrosion primer and a protective bike-detailing spray, which made it on to the shelves in Halfords. But the loss-making enterprise was wound down in 2023 and Canada’s Universal Matter acquired its main business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ron Mertens, the owner of the website Graphene-Info, says: “As is true in the wider materials industry, things take a very long time to reach the market. Many graphene producers and developers never managed to generate meaningful revenues or become profitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gloucestershire-based Versarien grew from a garage startup in 2010. Supported by Innovate UK, a government agency, it has developed graphene powders and other products for use in sensors, low-carbon concrete, paints, inks for electronics and textiles such as Umbro running gear and prototype stealth materials for the US military.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Aim-listed company expanded into Spain and South Korea but ran into financial difficulties and was forced to place several subsidiaries in administration or voluntary liquidation in July. Versarien has been seeking to sell its assets, including its patent portfolio, and only has enough cash to keep going until the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on the deal, it may undertake a solvent liquidation of the company or become a cash shell. An investment deal with a Chinese partner collapsed after the UK government intervened to block any collaboration on technology. It would be a sad end for a once promising graphene business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multipath TCP or MPTCP is an extension to the standard TCP and is described in RFC 8684. It allows a device to make use of multiple interfaces at once to send and receive TCP packets over a single MPTCP connection. MPTCP can aggregate the bandwidth of multiple interfaces or prefer the one with the lowest latency. It also allows a fail-over if one path is down, and the traffic is seamlessly reinjected on other paths.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Use cases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to MPTCP, being able to use multiple paths in parallel or simultaneously brings new use-cases, compared to TCP:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Seamless handovers: switching from one path to another while preserving established connections, e.g. Apple is using Multipath TCP on smartphones mainly for this reason since 2013.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Best network selection: using the “best” available path depending on some conditions, e.g. latency, losses, cost, bandwidth, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Network aggregation: using multiple paths at the same time to have a higher throughput, e.g. to combine fixed and mobile networks to send files faster.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Concepts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, when a new socket is created with the &lt;code&gt;IPPROTO_MPTCP&lt;/code&gt; protocol (Linux-specific), a subflow (or path) is created. This subflow consists of a regular TCP connection that is used to transmit data through one interface. Additional subflows can be negotiated later between the hosts. For the remote host to be able to detect the use of MPTCP, a new field is added to the TCP option field of the underlying TCP subflow. This field contains, amongst other things, a &lt;code&gt;MP_CAPABLE&lt;/code&gt; option that tells the other host to use MPTCP if it is supported. If the remote host or any middlebox in between does not support it, the returned &lt;code&gt;SYN+ACK&lt;/code&gt; packet will not contain MPTCP options in the TCP option field. In that case, the connection will be “downgraded” to plain TCP, and it will continue with a single path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This behavior is made possible by two internal components: the path manager, and the packet scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Path Manager&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Path Manager is in charge of subflows, from creation to deletion, and also address announcements. Typically, it is the client side that initiates subflows, and the server side that announces additional addresses via the &lt;code&gt;ADD_ADDR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;REMOVE_ADDR&lt;/code&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;graph LR;
    C_1(&amp;lt;div style="display: inline-block; min-width: 35px"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font size="7"&amp;gt;fa:fa-mobile&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;)
    S_1((&amp;lt;div style="display: inline-block; min-width: 60px"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font size="7"&amp;gt;fa:fa-cloud&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;))

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Linux v5.19, there are two path managers, controlled by the &lt;code&gt;net.mptcp.pm_type&lt;/code&gt; sysctl knob: the in-kernel one (type &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;) where the same rules are applied for all the connections (see: &lt;code&gt;ip mptcp&lt;/code&gt;) ; and the userspace one (type &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;), controlled by a userspace daemon (i.e. &lt;code&gt;mptcpd&lt;/code&gt;) where different rules can be applied for each connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Packet Scheduler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Packet Scheduler is in charge of selecting which available subflow(s) to use to send the next data packet. It can decide to maximize the use of the available bandwidth, only to pick the path with the lower latency, or any other policy depending on the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;graph LR;
    A_2(&amp;lt;div style="display: inline-block; min-width: 40px"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font size="7"&amp;gt;fa:fa-user&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;)

    PS ~~~|"Packets distribution between subflows"| PS
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Linux v6.8, there is only one packet scheduler, controlled by sysctl knobs in &lt;code&gt;net.mptcp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Linux v6.10, major features of MPTCP include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support of the &lt;code&gt;IPPROTO_MPTCP&lt;/code&gt;protocol in&lt;code&gt;socket()&lt;/code&gt;system calls.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fallback from MPTCP to TCP if the peer or a middlebox do not support MPTCP.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Path management using either an in-kernel or userspace path manager.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Socket options that are commonly used with TCP sockets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debug features including MIB counters, diag support (used by the &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt;command), and tracepoints.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, Jake Stid, a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State University, announced Ground-Mounted Solar Energy in the United States (GM-SEUS). This is a 15K-array, 2.9M-panel dataset of utility and commercial-grade solar farms across the lower 48 states plus the District of Columbia. This dataset was constructed by a team of researchers including alumni from NOAA, NASA and the USGS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is a heatmap of the assets catalogued in this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GM-SEUS is broken up into two datasets, one for arrays and another panels. Below you can see a solar farm with the array outlined in red and the panels covered purple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll explore GM-SEUS's Solar Farm dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Workstation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using a 5.7 GHz AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. It has 16 cores and 32 threads and 1.2 MB of L1, 16 MB of L2 and 64 MB of L3 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 4,800 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock X870E Nova 90 Motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm running Ubuntu 24 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and ArcGIS Pro only supports Windows natively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing Prerequisites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll use GDAL 3.9.3 and a few other tools to help analyse the data in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install \
    gdal-bin \
    jq
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll use DuckDB v1.4.1, along with its H3, JSON, Lindel, Parquet and Spatial extensions, in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ cd ~
$ wget -c https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v1.4.1/duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip
$ unzip -j duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip
$ chmod +x duckdb
$ ~/duckdb
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;INSTALL h3 FROM community;
INSTALL lindel FROM community;
INSTALL json;
INSTALL parquet;
INSTALL spatial;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll set up DuckDB to load every installed extension each time it launches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ vi ~/.duckdbrc
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.timer on
.width 180
LOAD h3;
LOAD lindel;
LOAD json;
LOAD parquet;
LOAD spatial;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maps in this post were mostly rendered with QGIS version 3.44. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used QGIS' Tile+ plugin to add basemaps from Esri to the maps in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Analysis-Ready Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll download a dataset containing the US CENSUS State codes. This will let me map the state ID in the arrays dataset to their state name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ wget https://gist.github.com/a8dx/2340f9527af64f8ef8439366de981168/raw/81d876daea10eab5c2675811c39bcd18a79a9212/US_State_Bounding_Boxes.csv
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll download the ZIP file of deliverables for GM-SEUS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ wget -O GMSEUS_v1_0.zip \
    'https://zenodo.org/records/14827819/files/GMSEUS_v1_0.zip?download=1'
$ unzip GMSEUS_v1_0.zip
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll extract the projection used. This proj4 string will be used to below to re-project the data into EPSG:4326.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ gdalsrsinfo \
    -o proj4 \
    GMSEUS_v1_0/GPKG/GMSEUS_Arrays_Final.gpkg
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+proj=aea +lat_0=37.5 +lon_0=-96 +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll use DuckDB to clean up the values and produce both a geometry field and a bounding box for each feature in this dataset. This will make working with this dataset remotely, such as from AWS S3, much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ ~/duckdb
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This following produced a ZStandard-compressed, spatially-sorted Parquet file of the arrays dataset. I dropped the Z dimension as it was unused. The unknown values have been turned into NULLs. The original GPKG file was 108 MB and the resulting Parquet file is 37 MB.&lt;/p&gt;

    SELECT   H3_LATLNG_TO_CELL(
                bbox.ymin,
                bbox.xmin, 4) AS h3_4,
             COUNT(*) num_buildings
    FROM     READ_PARQUET('arrays.parquet')
    WHERE    bbox.xmin BETWEEN -178.5 AND 178.5
    GROUP BY 1;

COPY (
    SELECT ST_ASWKB(H3_CELL_TO_BOUNDARY_WKT(h3_4)::geometry) geometry,
           num_buildings
    FROM   h3_4_stats
) TO 'h3_4_stats.gpkg'
  WITH (FORMAT GDAL,
        DRIVER 'GPKG',
        LAYER_CREATION_OPTIONS 'WRITE_BBOX=YES');
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally I would produce a Parquet file as even with 10s of thousands of records it'll generate in seconds versus a minute or so with GPKG. But ArcGIS Pro 3.5 didn't want to open the Parquet file I generated. QGIS 3.44 was fine with it but I wanted to use Esri's Nova basemap for the rendering below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ArcGIS Pro 3.6 should be released sometime in the next few weeks so I'll re-examine this issue when it's out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The last year has been brutal for businesses globally. Taking examples from my home country, the UK, the cost is over £1B and still rising, as well as the loss of at least one life due to cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Marks &amp;amp; Spencer lost £300M when ransomware crippled its systems for weeks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Co-op suffered a related attack, losing over £200M in sales and the customer data of more than 20 million people.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jaguar Land Rover’s assembly lines have been shut down for weeks, haemorrhaging £70M per week and requiring a £1.5B loan secured by the government.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transport for London’s systems were compromised, with the ensuing disruption lasting months, costing £39mn and exposing 5,000 customers’ banking details. Two teenagers are being prosecuted for the attack.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most tragically, a patient at King’s College Hospital died after ransomware delayed critical blood test results. Speaking to friends that were sat in meetings to decide who got blood tests each day, the human toll was evident. Cyberattacks aren’t just about money!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren’t isolated incidents - they’re symptoms of a systemic vulnerability in how we build computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the Verizon 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report, credential abuse and exploitation of vulnerabilities continue to dominate as attack vectors, accounting for 22% and 20% of breaches respectively. The exploitation of vulnerabilities saw a 34% surge year-over-year, creating what Verizon describes as a “concerning threat landscape”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re yet to learn the root causes and attack chains involved in each of the examples above, but many involved ransomware, which frequently uses software exploits as a post-initial-access vector to gain control of target systems and spread across a network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: approximately 70% of all software vulnerabilities stem from a single root cause - memory safety issues. This isn’t a new problem. Google, Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla and the Linux Foundation have all reported similar figures for their software over the last two decades. The uncomfortable truth is that current CPUs are fundamentally incapable of preventing these vulnerabilities, and traditional software patches have proven woefully inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rewriting all the world’s software into memory safe languages, such as C#, Java and Rust, is unviable. While new projects may be adopting Rust over C/C++, and some critical components are being rewritten into safe languages, the scale and depth of the C and C++ ecosystems makes it practically impossible to rewrite all the world’s unsafe software. The risk of introducing other (non-memory-safety) issues during a software rewrite also poses a substantial barrier. Given sufficient software compatibility, it is actually easier to swap the hardware!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two architectural approaches have emerged to tackle this trillion-dollar problem at the hardware level:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CHERI: Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions - pioneered at University of Cambridge (UK), and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OMA: Object Memory Architecture - pioneered at University of Bristol (UK) and now being commercialised by Doubtless Computing.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both aim to make memory-unsafe systems safe-by-design but they take different paths to get there. Understanding these differences matters because the choice between them will shape the security and performance characteristics of computing for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Memory Safety Crisis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before diving into solutions, it’s worth understanding what we’re solving. When software runs, it constantly allocates and deallocates memory - think of it like booking rooms in a hotel. Memory safety vulnerabilities arise when this process goes wrong. If you stay in the same hotel twice, you shouldn’t be able to access your old room even if you remember the number (use-after-free/ use-after-reallocate). Similarly, you shouldn’t be able to enter a neighbouring room (buffer overflow), or use a room without booking one in the first place (invalid pointer dereference). Software has these same problems with memory allocations (room bookings).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These bugs become catastrophic vulnerabilities when attackers exploit them to read sensitive data they shouldn’t access, manipulate critical system variables, or inject malicious code. The underlying architecture of today’s processors - paging-based virtual memory - lacks the granularity needed to enforce security within a single application or process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory safety breaks down into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Referential safety ensures pointers genuinely reference allocated memory and can’t be forged. Think of it as ensuring software has a valid booking for a room, ensuring accesses to memory are authorized, and that bookings can’t be faked.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spatial safety prevents accessing memory outside allocated bounds - no going into neighbouring rooms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Temporal safety addresses what happens over time, ensuring memory can’t be accessed after it’s been freed and reallocated. In our hotel analogy, a second stay at the hotel shouldn’t allow you to access your previous room, even if you remember the room number.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional architectures like x86, Arm, and RISC-V rely on coarse-grained page-level protection (typically 4KB or larger pages), which is far too blunt an instrument for modern security needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CHERI: Capabilities Meet Legacy Systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHERI, developed over more than a decade by the University of Cambridge and SRI International, extends conventional instruction set architectures with hardware-enforced capabilities. A CHERI capability is a form of fat pointer - it contains not just a memory address but also bounds information, permissions, and validity metadata. Every memory access gets checked against these constraints in hardware, catching violations before they can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture provides strong referential and spatial safety guarantees. When you have a CHERI capability, you provably have legitimate access to a specific bounded region of memory, and the hardware won’t let you stray outside those bounds. CHERI achieves this while maintaining compatibility with existing paged memory architectures, which is both its greatest strength and a source of limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s where it gets interesting: CHERI’s capabilities are large. On a 64-bit system, a CHERI pointer requires 129 bits (including the hidden tag bit) - essentially double the data width of the base architecture. This decision to encode all protection metadata within the pointer itself has profound implications. Every data structure that stores pointers effectively doubles in memory consumption for those fields. Capabilities in memory (stack/heap) must be aligned to natural 128-bit boundaries. Cache lines, which are precious and limited, now hold fewer actual pointers. Memory bandwidth requirements increase because for each pointer you’re moving twice as much data around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHERI provides hardware-enforced referential and spatial safety but leaves temporal safety to software. You can achieve temporal memory safety with CHERI, but it requires modifying your memory allocator and implementing pointer revocation mechanisms - essentially software to scan memory to find and invalidate stale pointers. This software-based approach to temporal safety remains part of the trusted computing base and requires careful verification. It’s also closely related to software garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research has explored various temporal safety mechanisms for CHERI, but they all involve non-trivial software complexity and performance overhead. In theory, hardware acceleration may be possible but is likely to always require software involvement. This is because a CHERI capability covers a range of memory, which may include more than one object. Software allocation and object type information is required to differentiate objects and thus revoke capabilities appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software ecosystem for CHERI has made impressive progress. Most code recompiles with minimal changes, though the capability width difference can require significant rewrites for certain applications. Additionally, it causes a division in the ISA where load/stores of capabilities must be handled separately from ordinary data. This leads to some complexity in the compiler to detect edge cases where the compiler does not know for certain whether a register or memory slot contains a capability or not. C/C++ code which abuses pointers by treating them as integers, which is uncommon but frequent enough to cause a headache, requires some effort to address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm’s Morello project, which implemented CHERI on a modified Neoverse N1 core, revealed performance challenges that have pushed commercial CHERI efforts toward smaller embedded processors for the time being. Notably, Arm declined to join the CHERI Alliance, instead indicating they will take a step back from new work on Morello and wait to see if CHERI gains the long-sought commercial traction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OMA: Rethinking Memory From the Ground Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doubtless Computing’s Object Memory Architecture takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than extending paged memory, OMA implements object-based memory management directly in hardware. Every allocation becomes a first-class hardware object with its own identity, bounds, and metadata maintained by the processor itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architectural choice enables several key advantages. OMA pointers are leaner - 65 bits on a 64-bit architecture, including the hidden tag bit. Rather than carrying all metadata with every pointer, OMA stores object information centrally in hardware-managed directories. This reduces memory bandwidth requirements and means that multiple pointers to the same object don’t duplicate metadata. The hardware maintains a complete understanding of object relationships and lifecycles, enabling optimizations that software-only approaches can’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical differentiator is temporal safety. OMA implements garbage collection in hardware, scanning for and reclaiming unreachable objects in real-time as part of the processor’s normal operation. This isn’t the same as software garbage collection - it’s parallel, highly optimized, and doesn’t block program execution. By managing object lifecycles in hardware, OMA provides hardware-guaranteed temporal safety alongside referential and spatial protections, completing the trinity of memory safety properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be tempting to say that memory safety is solved by using a managed language like Java, JavaScript, Swift or Python. Unfortunately, this doesn’t hold up in practice. Managed language runtimes, as well as many supporting libraries, are written in C/C++ and suffer memory safety issues just as much as any other C/C++ code. The operating systems and hypervisors are also exposed to these languages, offering yet another attack surface. This leaves managed language apps vulnerable. Memory safe languages, including both Rust and managed languages, are a distinct improvement over traditional C and C++, but only hardware can provide the safety guarantees we need in today’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For managed languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, C# and Go, the OMA architecture delivers dramatic performance improvements. Doubtless Computing’s analysis of CPython 3.12 reveals that 32-44% of instructions are spent on memory management operations - allocation, deallocation, reference counting, and garbage collection. Moving these operations into parallel hardware execution, along with microarchitectural optimisations derived from hardware’s new understanding of the structure of data in memory, yields 2-5x speedups for managed language applications. Even C/C++ applications see 1.2-2x improvements as the hardware optimizes memory management functions and eliminates per-object metadata from cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The architecture maintains full source code compatibility for managed languages - all changes are confined to the runtime. For C/C++, the story is much the same as with CHERI: recompilation with modified standard libraries and a modified compiler, such as LLVM or GCC. Maintaining the pointer width the same as the data width, and the same alignment requirements, avoids the ISA-level split for handling pointers, which simplifies the compiler and improves compatibility with legacy C/C++ code. This compatibility approach differs from CHERI’s and aligns with OMA’s target market: server-class and application processors, where managed languages dominate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fundamental Trade-offs: Where the Architectures Diverge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The philosophical differences between CHERI and OMA create distinct trade-off profiles. CHERI carries all metadata with pointers, enabling incremental adoption where different parts of a program can use capabilities independently. OMA’s centralized metadata requires the hardware to maintain a consistent view of all objects but enables more aggressive optimization. CHERI works within the existing paged memory model, simplifying system software migration. OMA introduces a new memory model that requires deeper changes but delivers performance gains that paged architectures can’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These differences manifest in pointer width - CHERI’s 129-bit capabilities versus OMA’s 65-bit pointers. While both exceed the base address width, the doubling effect in CHERI has more severe implications for data structure layouts, cache efficiency, and memory bandwidth. Research on CHERI implementations has shown there is a long road ahead to achieve performance parity for managed languages. In the meantime, OMA offers a shorter path with substantial speedups rather than equal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Temporal safety represents perhaps the most significant divergence in security. CHERI’s software-based pointer revocation requires explicit memory scanning and manipulation, adding complexity to the trusted computing base and verification burden. OMA’s hardware garbage collection happens transparently and continuously, providing stronger guarantees with less software complexity. This matters enormously for total cost of ownership - every line of security-critical software that doesn’t need to be written, verified, and maintained is a win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The instruction set philosophies differ too. CHERI historically opts for ISA changes beyond pure memory safety to achieve its security goals, which can complicate adoption. OMA has historically prioritized backward compatibility, though this is adaptable based on market requirements. The consensus in the industry is that software compatibility presents the primary barrier to new processor designs, which favours architectures that minimize disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Industrial Relevance and Market Fit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHERI and OMA target fundamentally different computing environments, which is why calling them competitors misses the point. They’re complementary solutions to a shared problem, each optimized for distinct use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHERI finds its natural home in embedded systems and microcontrollers. These environments predominantly use C, C++, or Rust with restricted or no dynamic memory allocation. The code bases are smaller and more amenable to the verification required to ensure CHERI capabilities are used correctly. The memory overhead from wider pointers, while still present, matters less in resource-constrained designs that carefully manage every allocation. Four companies - SCI Semiconductor, Codasip, lowRISC, and Secqai - are actively commercializing CHERI for embedded applications. SCI’s ICENI family of CHERIoT microcontrollers, built on Microsoft’s open-source CHERIoT-Ibex core, targets the IoT and operational technology markets. Codasip offers CHERI-enabled RISC-V IP cores for custom processor designs. lowRISC’s Sonata platform provides an open-source FPGA-based development environment for CHERIoT research and prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm’s experience with CHERI tells an important story about scaling limitations. The Morello project, which implemented CHERI on a modified Neoverse N1 server-class core, yielded results that Arm appears to have found unsatisfactory. There has been no apparent follow-up on the substantial initial investment made into the Arm Morello designs. This assessment seems to reflect the performance challenges that CHERI faces in larger systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OMA’s sweet spot sits at the opposite end of the spectrum. Application-class and server-class processors running managed languages benefit enormously from hardware-accelerated memory management. Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Go all share similar memory models that align naturally with OMA’s object-based approach. These environments already use garbage collection extensively, so moving that functionality into hardware removes overhead, rather than adding it as it would in embedded systems. The performance gains - up to 5x for managed languages - become transformational for data centre workloads where every percentage point of efficiency translates to millions in operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The market dynamics favour different adoption paths. CHERI benefits from strong government backing, particularly from the now-ended UK’s Digital Security by Design programme and recognition from the US White House and NSA. This institutional support hopes to accelerate adoption in defence and critical infrastructure applications. CHERI’s open-source foundation through the CHERI Alliance creates a broad ecosystem but limits opportunities for proprietary differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OMA’s proprietary nature and performance advantages position it for commercial data centre deployment. The technology directly addresses the performance problems that hindered CHERI at scale. While OMA lacks CHERI’s first-mover advantage and government momentum, it offers compelling value for cloud providers and enterprises running managed language workloads. The economic argument is straightforward: if you can eliminate 70% of vulnerabilities while quintupling performance for your Python services, the return on investment is measured in weeks from deployment, rather than years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OMA’s proprietary technology makes it attractive for investment as it can be patented. However, CHERI’s openness makes it possible for independent security teams to verify the safety of the architecture. Open implementations of CHERI processors also enables those designs to be independently verified. Doubtless Computing will need to make its ISA public, which is inevitable anyway for a new CPU as customers will require it. Doubtless will also need to offer a public platform for independent researchers to build confidence in the security claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The CHERI Ecosystem: Who’s Building What&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHERI Alliance, formally launched in 2024, coordinates standardization and adoption efforts across industry and academia. Founding members include the FreeBSD Foundation, Capabilities Limited, SCI Semiconductor, Codasip, lowRISC, and the University of Cambridge. Google’s participation as a founding member signals serious industry interest, though notably Arm is not a member.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SCI Semiconductor, based in Cambridge, leads commercialization of Microsoft’s open-source CHERIoT Ibex implementation for embedded systems. Their ICENI family of processors targets microcontroller applications in automotive, industrial control, defence, and aerospace. The company has secured strategic distribution through EPS Global, which specializes in automotive tier-one suppliers and contract manufacturers. SCI’s early access program, in collaboration with lowRISC, allows select partners to begin development on lowRISC’s FPGA-based Sonata platform with guaranteed migration paths to production silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codasip, a RISC-V processor IP vendor, offers the X730 - a CHERI-enabled 64-bit application-class core based on their A730 design. Their “Custom Compute” methodology allows customers to license CHERI-enhanced cores or customize them further using Codasip Studio. The company has donated a CHERI SDK built on open-source tools to the CHERI Alliance, making it freely available for anyone implementing CHERI on RISC-V. Codasip is also developing Linux kernel support for RISC-V CHERI, which will be crucial for broader adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lowRISC, a not-for-profit organization spun out of Cambridge University, maintains the Sonata evaluation platform and leads the UK-government-funded Sunburst Project. Sonata provides a complete FPGA-based development environment for CHERIoT, enabling software development and hardware experimentation before silicon is available. The Sunburst Project’s recent expansion to include SCI Semiconductor aims to validate CHERIoT designs through commercial tapeout on GlobalFoundries’ 22nm process, with all project deliverables remaining open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;zeroRISC is a startup and partner in the OpenTitan project administered by lowRISC. Their goal is to commercialise the OpenTitan silicon IP through their Integrity Management Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s role deserves special mention. Microsoft Research developed CHERIoT-Ibex, an open-source RISC-V core optimized for embedded systems. They’ve made this core freely available and co-maintain the CHERIoT Platform repository with SCI Semiconductor. David Weston, Microsoft’s VP of Enterprise and OS Security, has publicly endorsed SCI’s commercialization efforts, stating that CHERI represents a “promising technology that can be used to enhance computer security.” This corporate backing from a major software vendor adds credibility to the embedded CHERI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK government’s support through the now-ended Digital Security by Design programme and UKRI funding has been instrumental in advancing CHERI. The programme provided ~£190 million in research funding over five years and continues to support development through initiatives like Sunburst. This institutional backing, combined with endorsements from the US White House and NSA, positions CHERI advantageously for government and defence procurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHERI and OMA represent two responses to the memory safety crisis, each with distinct strengths that make them suited to different computing environments. The notion that one must “win” while the other “loses” misunderstands the landscape - the computing world is large enough, and varied enough, that multiple approaches can and should coexist. Cybersecurity principles also demand diversity of solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CHERI’s compatibility with existing paged memory architectures and incremental deployment model make it an excellent fit for embedded systems where code bases are manageable, languages are predominantly C/C++/Rust, and the verification burden is acceptable. The active CHERI ecosystem, backed by government support and open-source collaboration, has created momentum that shouldn’t be underestimated. For IoT devices, industrial control systems, and safety-critical embedded applications, CHERI offers a practical path to hardware-enforced memory safety that companies can adopt today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OMA’s object-based architecture and integrated hardware garbage collection (IHGC) deliver transformational performance for managed language workloads. By tackling temporal safety in hardware alongside referential and spatial protections, OMA provides more complete memory safety with less software complexity. The performance gains - up to 5x for Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Go - directly address the scalability problems that have limited CHERI in larger systems. For data centres, cloud infrastructure, and application servers where managed languages dominate, OMA presents compelling advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both architectures eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities. The formal guarantees that CHERI can provide are a subset of what OMA delivers, since OMA includes hardware-enforced temporal safety. However, CHERI’s earlier start and ecosystem momentum matter significantly in technology adoption. The question isn’t which architecture is “better” in absolute terms but rather which is more appropriate for specific use cases and deployment contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, memory safety will increasingly become a non-negotiable requirement. The UK National Cyber Security Centre, US White House, and NSA have all called for fundamental changes in how we build secure systems. The attacks on Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, Co-op, Jaguar Land Rover, the NHS, Transport for London, and many others, demonstrate that our current approach isn’t working. Software-only solutions like Rust, while valuable, face adoption barriers that make them insufficient on their own. Hardware-based memory safety, whether through CHERI, OMA, or future approaches we haven’t yet invented, represents the most practical path to eliminating this class of vulnerability at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry moves slowly, with design cycles measured in years and deployment timelines measured in decades. Today’s architectural decisions will shape computing security through 2040 and beyond. The good news is that we now have proven approaches to memory safety that work in real hardware. CHERI has demonstrated its viability in embedded systems. OMA has shown it can deliver both security and performance for managed languages with a hardware prototype on AWS Cloud FPGAs supporting CPython 3.12 and Jupyter Notebooks. The challenge now isn’t technical feasibility - it’s economic deployment and ecosystem coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For embedded designers, CHERI offers immediate benefits with manageable overhead. For cloud and data centre operators, OMA promises to eliminate vulnerabilities while dramatically improving performance. The fundamental insight is that both approaches work by making the right choices for their target markets. We don’t need to pick one winner. We need both, deployed where each makes the most sense, steadily displacing the insecure architectures that enabled the attacks we’ve seen this year. The trillion-dollar memory safety problem is solvable - and the will to deploy the solutions we’ve built is growing as organisations can no longer afford the risk of being vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take an OpenGL matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;float m [ 16 ] ;Consider this as a 4x4 array with it's elements laid out into four columns like this:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;m[0] m[4] m[ 8] m[12] m[1] m[5] m[ 9] m[13] m[2] m[6] m[10] m[14] m[3] m[7] m[11] m[15]WARNING: Mathematicians like to see their matrices laid out on paper this way (with the array indices increasing down the columns instead of across the rows as a programmer would usually write them). Look CAREFULLY at the order of the matrix elements in the layout above!&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...but we are OpenGL programmers - not mathematicians - right?! The reason OpenGL arrays are laid out in what some people would consider to be the opposite direction to mathematical convention is somewhat lost in the mists of time. However, it turns out to be a happy accident as we will see later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are dealing with a matrix which only deals with rigid bodies (ie no scale, shear, squash, etc) then the last row (array elements 3,7,11 and 15) are always 0,0,0 and 1 respectively and so long as they always maintain those values, we can safely forget about them for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first three elements of the rightmost column of the matrix is just the overall translation. If you imagine some kind of neat little compact object (like a teapot), then array elements 12,13 and 14 tell you where it is in the world. It doesn't matter what combinations of rotations and translations it took to produce the matrix, the rightmost column tells you where the object basically is. It is often fortunate that the OpenGL matrix array is laid out the way it is because it results in those three elements being consecutive in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so now we are down to only nine random-looking numbers. These are the top three elements of each of the first three columns - and collectively they represent the rotation of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easy way to decode those numbers is to imagine what happens to four points near to the origin after they are transformed by the matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(0,1,0) | /(0,0,1) | / |/___(1,0,0) (0,0,0)These are four vertices on a 1x1x1 cube that has one corner at the origin.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the matrix has transformed this cube, where does it end up?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, if we neglect the translation part (the bottom row), then the pure rotation part simply describes the new location of the points on the cube:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(1,0,0) ---&amp;gt; ( m[0], m[1], m[2] ) (0,1,0) ---&amp;gt; ( m[4], m[5], m[6] ) (0,0,1) ---&amp;gt; ( m[8], m[9], m[10]) (0,0,0) ---&amp;gt; ( 0, 0, 0 )After that, you just add the translation onto each point so that:&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;(1,0,0) ---&amp;gt; ( m[0], m[1], m[2] ) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] ) (0,1,0) ---&amp;gt; ( m[4], m[5], m[6] ) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] ) (0,0,1) ---&amp;gt; ( m[8], m[9], m[10]) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] ) (0,0,0) ---&amp;gt; ( 0, 0, 0 ) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] )Once you know this, it becomes quite easy to use matrices to position objects exactly where you need them without messing around with multiple calls to glRotate.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just imagine a little cube at the origin - pretend it's firmly attached to your model. Think about where the cube ends up as the model moves - write down where it's vertices would end up and there is your matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if I gave you this matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;0.707, -0.707, 0, 10 0.707, 0.707, 0, 10 0 , 0 , 1, 0 0 , 0 , 0, 1...you could easily see that the X axis of that little cube is now pointing somewhere between the X and Y axes, the Y axis is pointing somewhere between Y and negative X and the Z axis is unchanged. The entire cube has been moved 10 units off in X and Y. This is a 45 degree rotation about Z and a 10,10,0 translation! You didn't need any hard math - just a mental picture of what the little cube did - and no concerns about the order of operations or anything hard like that. What would have happened to something out at 100,100,0? Well, just imagine it was glued to the cube (on the end of a long stick)...as the cube rotated, the thing at 100,100 would have moved quite a bit too - in fact, you can see that the rotation would put it onto the Y axis and the translation would have moved it 10 units up and to the right.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With practice, you can figure out what that last row of numbers does to the little cube too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, would you like to know how to use a matrix to squash, stretch, shear, etc? Just think about where the axes of that little cube end up - write them down and you are done. What does a cube of jello look like when there is a strong wind blowing from X=-infinity?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1, 0.3, 0, 0 0, 0.9, 0, 0 0, 0 , 1, 0 0, 0 , 0, 1Look - the Y axis is leaning a third of a unit to the right and the cube got a bit shorter.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose your cartoon character is going to jump vertically, and you want to do a bit of pre-squash before the jump... and post-stretch during the jump. Just gradually vary the matrix from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1 , 0 , 0, 0 1 , 0 , 0, 0 0 , 0.8, 0, 0 0 , 1.2, 0, 0 0 , 0 , 1, 0 ===&amp;gt; 0 , 0 , 1, 0 0 , 0 , 0, 1 0 , 0 , 0, 1Not bad - he got shorter then longer - how about getting a bit fatter too (conservation of cartoon volume) ?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1.2, 0 , 0 , 0 0.9,0 , 0 , 0 0 , 0.8, 0 , 0 0 ,1.2, 0 , 0 0 , 0 , 1.2, 0 ===&amp;gt; 0 ,0 ,0.9, 0 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 0 ,0 , 0 , 1Now the cube got smaller in Y and bigger in X and Z then got bigger in Y and smaller in X/Z...easy!&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only is it easier to think transforms out this way, but it's invariably more efficient too. By seeing the entire transformation as one whole operation on a unit cube, you save a long sequence of glRotate/glTranslate/glScale commands - which each imply a complicated set of multiply/add steps to concatenate the new transform with whatever is on the top of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, there is one matrix that we all need to know - the "Identity" matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;1, 0, 0, 0 0, 1, 0, 0 0, 0, 1, 0 0, 0, 0, 1As you can see, this matrix leaves all the axes completely alone and performs no translation. This is a "do nothing" matrix.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matrices are really easy - it's just a matter of looking at them pictorially.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Smartphones and being present&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read an article yesterday, stating that on average, people spend 4 hours and 37 minutes on their phones per day1, with South Africans coming in fourth highest in the world at a whopping 5 hours and 11 minutes2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This figure seems really high to me. If we assume people sleep roughly 8 hours per day, that means that one third of their day is spent on their phones. If we also assume people work 8 hours per day (ignoring the fact that they may be using their phones during work hours), that suggests that people spend over half of their free time (and up to 65% of it) glued to their screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never wanted to carry the internet around in my pocket. It's too distracting and pulls me out of the present moment, fracturing my attention. I've tried switching to old-school black and white phones before, but always begrudgingly returned to using a smartphone due to the utility of it. The problem, however, is that it comes with too many attention sinks tucked in alongside the useful tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I care about living an intentional and meaningful life, nurturing relationships, having nuanced conversations, and enjoying the world around me. I don't want to spend this limited time I have on earth watching short form video and getting into arguments on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what I enjoy. Picture taken yesterday in Scarborough, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've written at length about how I manage my digital consumption, from turning off notifications to forgoing social media entirely. The underlying premise here is that if you're trying to lose weight, you shouldn't carry cookies around in your pockets. And my phone is the bag of cookies in this metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're wired to seek out distraction, novel information, and entertainment, and avoid boredom at all costs. But boredom is where creativity and self-reflection do their best work. It's why "all the best ideas come when you're in the shower"—we don't usually take our phones with us into the shower (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Screen Time on my iPhone, on average I spend 30 minutes per day on it, which I think is reasonable, especially considering the most-used apps are by-and-large utility apps like banking and messages. This isn't because I have more self-control than other people. I don't think I do. It's because I know myself, and have set up my digital life to be a positive force, and not an uninspired time-sink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many apps and systems to incentivise better relationships with our phones, mostly based around time limits. But these are flawed in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I'm an adult, I know how to circumvent these limits, and I will if motivation is low.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Time limits don't affect the underlying addiction. You don't quit smoking by only smoking certain hours of the day.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The companies that build these apps have tens of thousands of really smart people (and billions of dollars) trying to get me hooked and keep me engaged. The only way to win this game isn't by trying to beat them (I certainly can't), but by not playing.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only way I've found to have a good relationship with my phone is to make it as uninteresting as possible. The first way is to not have recommendation media (think Instagram, TikTok, and all the rest). I'm pro deleting these accounts completely, because it's really easy to re-download the apps on a whim, or visit them in-browser. However some people have found that having them on a dedicated device works by isolating those activities. Something like a tablet at home that is "the only place you're allowed to use Instagram". I can't comment too much on this route, but it seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest time sink over the past few years has been YouTube. The algorithm knew me too well and would recommend video after engaging, but ultimately useless video. I could easily burn an entire evening watching absolute junk—leaving me feeling like I'd just wasted what could have otherwise been a beautiful sunset or a tasty home-cooked lasagne. However, at the beginning of this year I learnt that you can turn off your YouTube watch history entirely, which means no recommendations. Here's what my YouTube home screen now looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without the recommendations I very quickly run out of things to watch from the channels I'm subscribed to. It's completely changed my relationship with YouTube since I only watch the videos I actually want to watch, and none of the attention traps. You can turn off your YouTube watch history here, and auto delete your other Google history (like historic searches and navigation) here, which I think is just good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also used my adblocker, AdGuard on Safari which has a useful "block element" feature, to block the recommended videos on the right of YouTube videos. I use this feature to hide shorts as well, since I have no interest in watching them either, and YouTube intentionally makes them impossible to remove. If you're interested in a similar setup, here are the selectors I use to block those elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;youtube.com###items &amp;gt; ytd-item-section-renderer.style-scope.ytd-watch-next-secondary-results-renderer:last-child
youtube.com###sections
youtube.com##[is-shorts]
youtube.com###secondary
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only media that I do sometimes consume on my phone are my RSS feeds, but it's something I'm completely comfortable with since it's explicitly opt-in by design and low volume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I still have the twitch to check my phone when I'm waiting for a coffee, or in-between activities—because my brain's reward system has been trained to do this—I'm now rewarded with nothing. Over time, I find myself checking my phone less and less. Sometimes I notice the urge, and just let it go, instead focusing on the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that while the attention-span-degrading effects of recommendation media are getting most of the headlines, what isn't spoken about as much is the sheer number of hours lost globally to our phones (3.8 million years per day, according to my back-of-the-napkin-math). And while people may argue that this could involve productive work or enjoyable leisure, I suspect that the vast (vast!) majority of that time is short-form entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My solution may sound overkill to many people, but I can say with absolute certainty that it has turned me into a more present, less distracted, and more optimistic person. I have much more time to spend in nature, with friends, or on my hobbies and projects. I can't imagine trading it in for a tiny screen, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happily on the beach for sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We spoke with the man behind the Psygnosis logo – and so much more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;English artist Roger Dean is a living legend, and his work in the video game industry represent just a small chapter in his extraordinary career. Dean was born in 1944 in Kent, but spent much of his childhood in Greece and Hong Kong. His father was an engineer in the British Army, so the family had to move wherever his work took him. In particular, the years he lived in Hong Kong would later become an important source of inspiration for him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After returning to England, he studied art, architecture, and furniture design, and it was actually in the latter field that he had his first breakthrough. He designed what he called the Sea Urchin Chair, a predecessor to the famous bean bag chair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was as a visual artist that he truly made his mark. In 1968, he created his first album cover, for the British rock band The Gun, and later became heavily involved with the prog rock bands Yes and Asia. His cover for Asia’s debut album was voted the second-best album cover of all time by readers of Rolling Stone Magazine in 1982, and it was also Dean who designed the very first logo for Richard Branson’s newly established Virgin Records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was in the 1980s that Roger Dean first became involved in the video game industry, where he was not only responsible for a number of iconic game covers, but also some of gaming’s most recognizable logos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we reached out to Dean to ask if he would like to do an interview with us, we honestly didn’t expect him to respond. And if he did, we assumed it would be just a small handful of questions answered by e-mail. But not only was he interested in talking with us, we ended up having a long and pleasant video call, during which he happily showed us his work and chatted about a variety of topics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that our main focus was on Dean’s work with games, so if you’d like to read more about everything else he’s done, you could, for example, check out this profile interview at We Love Vinyl. You should also visit his website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, we present an edited version of that conversation, supplemented with a bit of extra information about the topics we discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Black Onyx and Psygnosis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start in the mid eighties, which is when Dean first gets involved in the games industry. His first cover artwork was created for The Black Onyx, a game you’ve probably never heard of unless you’re very interested in the history of gaming. Because even though the producer and designer of that game was an American – Henk Rogers, who we’ll talk more about later – the game was only released in Japan. While it isn’t a famous game, it is an early example of a role-playing game developed in Japan, and it would help influence how Japanese developers approached the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For European gamers, it’s probably Dean’s other contract that proved the most memorable. When the British publisher Psygnosis was formed in 1984, they reached out to Roger Dean to create their logo. This would mark the start of a long lasting relationship which would shape much of the visual identity of the well remembered publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: How did you get involved with the games industry? I know that your first work was on The Black Onyx …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: That’s right! Well, Henk Rogers, who now publishes Tetris, sought me out – though this was before he got the rights to Tetris. He was aware of my work in music. So he knew my music and my books, and of course my album covers. He contacted me through my publishing company, and came to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: But that game only came out in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: That’s correct, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But about the same time I met Henk, I also met Jonathan Ellis of Psygnosis. I had met with Imagine Software before – two of the people from Imagine formed Psygnosis with Jonathan Ellis – and I did a whole bunch of Psygnosis stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: They contacted you? They’d seen your artwork already?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Yes, they contacted me. They’d certainly seen the books. We sold enormous amounts of posters and books back then. During the seventies, my posters, books, calendars etcetera sold about 65 million copies, and by the mid eighties we’d passed a hundred million sales. So it was out there, you know. Much more than today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: The owl logo, was that your idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Yeah, sure. That was my job. They gave me an idea about the kind of name that they wanted, so even the name was partly mine. Both the name and the owl… they were very clear about what they wanted, but they didn’t know visually or even how to put the words together. So the word came to me in the end, and the visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Do you remember how you came up with the idea of putting an owl in there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: What can I say? *laughs*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Did you see or play the games before you did the covers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: That’s not how it worked. It was the same with the music. Very often I had to finish the covers long before the games were done, and the content of the games was as much influenced by the cover as the cover was by the content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, I would say that the cover was influenced by them describing what they wanted to do for the game, and then me visualizing it. And then they would reproduce that to some degree themselves in the games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: So they just said: This is what we are thinking, and then you started working?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: They described the game, usually in much more extravagant terms than what the reality was. They would say they were making an interective movie, and I’d say «wow!». And when I saw it, there would be these little matchstick figures…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: What was the process like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, it was very different from the work I was used to doing, so from that point of view it was good fun for me. Like going in another direction, I enjoyed that a lot. Especially the designs I did for The Shadow of the Beast, they were very different from any album covers I’d made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Did you ever work on actual game [design] for them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: No, I remember when we did a game called Barbarian. The developers got very excited and asked me what I thought of their dragon. And I said, «what dragon?» Because I’d put a dragon on the box, and they’d then put my dragon in the game. And I said, «oh, you have to show me.» And they said, «it’s at the end of the first level, you haven’t gotten beyond the first level?» And I said «noo… I haven’t even started the first level!»&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Did they ever come back to you and ask you to redo something?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Not really. Maybe on one occation only. I can’t even remember what it was, but I did the lettering for it, and I found them another artist. In the end, that was a turning point for me, because they were already producing more games than I could possibly manage. So I would end up doing logos, but getting other artists to do the art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Yeah, I see some of your covers are listed as a collaboration with you and Tim White.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Tim White, yes. There was a number of artists in it. Chris Voss, I think. Peter Jones, maybe. Yeah. There was a few other artists who did covers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: So you did the logos, and they did the paintings?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: They did the painting, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Was there a community of artists who did covers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, I knew the artist because I had published the books, and that was in very recent history. You know, within ten years of when we had the publishing company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: I love all the covers you did for Psygnosis. Unfortunately, I don’t own so many, only Terrorpods I think. You did the logo there, I think?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Terrorpods is interesting because I did the drawings for that. The painting was done by Tim White, but it was my drawing. I drew the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: It’s one of my favorite covers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Yeah, it’s pretty good, I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: There was also some re-use of older album covers. Did you help facilitate that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: No, it’s the other way around. There were game ideas that became album covers. So game covers that became albums. Barbarian without the barbarian became a cover for a solo album by Steve Howe [from Yes], for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Ah, I see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: The rule that I have is that there can be no confusion. So I never use a painting for one album cover on another. That would not be good. But if it was a totally different thing the rules and the licensing arrangements allowed me to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: So you made sure of that going into the projects?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: From the very beginning, yes. I kept all the rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The evolution of game covers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked Roger Dean whether he ever received the finished game boxes he had worked on, and not only did get the boxes – he still has them! He then suggested showing us a few, and returned shortly afterward with the boxes for Shadow of the Beast I and II. Two large cardboard boxes with cover art that is both stunning and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led to a conversation about how game boxes have evolved over the years, and Dean’s thoughts on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Where did that [SotB] style come from?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: I was very interested in mechanical things. So when I was a student, a lot of my work was about ideas for machinery. So Shadow of the Beast was natural, a very easy connection, and it was good fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Those boxes are really unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, of course. There are no boxes at all today, are there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: No… I was thinking about that because those big old boxes, they were almost like the the old records, compared to what came later…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Yeah, and these are floppy disks inside. One also besides the floppy disks, I think it had a cassette, and a t-shirt. So it, so it had a book of instructions, floppy disk, cassette and t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Yeah. You don’t get that today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: No. And the t-shirt was kind of weird because you couldn’t choose the size, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Oh, well, it could be a gift for someone, if it didn’t fit…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: It would have had to be. Yeah. *laughs*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: But what I was getting at … I assume you’ve seen how game boxes just shrunk and became smaller and smaller, and now we don’t even have them. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, I don’t know. It’s the same problem, of course, with music. And what happened was that for a very short period of time, music made the perfect gift. You know, a 12 inch vinyl, it looked like and felt like something you would both like to give and receive. And that concept of the gift was really strong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know, back when the vinyl was normal, getting a record for your birthday or Christmas was a big deal. And a big deal to give because they were relatively expensive. They weren’t even affordable by young people until quite a few years after they were invented. But it was a big deal, that gift idea. When it first went to CD, the record companies destroyed the idea of a gift because they stripped out a lot of what made it special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, one of Yes’s biggest albums in terms of its impact and iconography was Close to the Edge. And when it came out in vinyl, the cover had the new logo, but the painting was inside. When it came out on CD, there was no painting, it was just a folded sheet of paper inside. It was black and white, no image. And I thought, you know, this is treating the customers with so little respect. It was just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as the industry went into decline, shortly after that, you could see, there was no respect. No respect for the music, for the bands and for the fans. It was their own fault that they were in trouble. The only country where the quality was persistent was Japan. Their CDs were always beautiful. In the West? They were rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Would you say the same was true for games?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: It wasn’t really the size, it was the complete lack of care that really troubled me enormously. I quite like the small versions [of records] that came out in Japan because they were like a kind of bonsai, but everything was there. All the art was there. In fact, Japan had the bonus of having the translation, so you got more than the basic thing. It was good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: Do you follow modern video game art?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: No, I don’t really. People show me stuff and I go, «wow, that’s pretty cool.» But I don’t go out of my way to follow it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tetris, and The Black Onyx part two&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Few games – if any – are more famous than Tetris. We won’t go into the history of this addictive puzzle game; you’ve probably heard it before. But it was the aforementioned Henk Rogers who ended up securing the rights to the game, and he also founded The Tetris Company together with the original Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov. When the time came to create an official Tetris logo in 1997, Roger Dean was the one they contacted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This, however, was not the only collaboration between Dean and Rogers. The other was an ambitious sequel to The Black Onyx that was sadly cancelled before completion. Based on what Dean tells us below, it sounds like a really ambitious project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: You also worked on Tetris.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: I did the Tetris logo. That was just a word, so much less interesting than the Psygnosis logo. But Tetris is a very interesting game…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: You knew Henk Rogers, did he always want you to do the logo?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: That was more than 25 years ago. Yeah, he he wanted me to do it because there were hundreds of versions out there. Not done by him, but by the various companies that’d license it. And people did pirate versions. Everyone had their own version of Tetris. So he wanted only one version of the logo. If someone had a license, they had to use the authorized logo. It was an attempt to put discipline into it, really.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then two or three years ago he handed over the management of Tetris to his daughter, Maya, and she changed the logo again. But it’s the same rules, one logo. Although it’s slightly different to mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: And The Black Onyx?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: A much, much, more lavish version of The Black Onyx was due to come out in the States, and I worked on that. It was my job to put together the team that did the content and the packaging, and that included the story, music, landscapes, costumes, everything. I didn’t do it alone, but I put together the team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: This was actual game development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Yes, this was a full-on role-playing game. A lot of the artwork appears in my book, Dragon’s Dream. But the very big, lavish production never happened, sadly. That was very disappointing. We worked on it for some years, it was good fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Do you know why it didn’t happen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: I’m not a hundred percent sure. It was a huge amount of work. It was a real shame that it never happened, because while the technology has moved on, the design would still be valid today. The music is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: So is there a chance it could see the light of day?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Heh, yeah, I think Henk Rogers would like to see it published. He owns the game, and I own the artwork. The big game was supposed to be called Onyx.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: This was much more advanced than the original?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Way more advanced. Too advanced for it’s time, really. It would have needed 24 CDs for each episode. DVDs arrived in the middle of it, but that would have only divided the number of CDs by three.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Do you remember any game projects that were particularly exciting to work with?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, you know what? Onyx, in the end, was the most exciting. Because that was the first time I got really hands on with the content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as I said, it’s still never seen the light of day. It is very interesting, because two weeks ago I had a visit from Henk Rogers. He’s doing a book called The Perfect Game about Tetris, and he’s doing an audio book. And in that he talks about different projects, including Black Onyx. For Black Onyx, he used some of the music that we created for the project, and it was really good by any standards. It was a great piece of music, not a great piece of game music, but a great piece of music. Even the music should be published. It hasn’t been, but it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: Who did that music?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, we did it in collaboration with two people called Youth and Jaz. Jaz Coleman was orchestral minded, but he was also a singer for a band called Killing Joke. So he had his rock and roll credentials. But he worked with Prague Symphony Orchestra and things like that. Youth (Martin Glover) was very much into electronic music. He had a band called The Orb, and he worked with people like Paul McCartney. Oh, he did all kinds of stuff. But his big interest was electronic music at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between them, one producing, one arranging, they made a lovely soundtrack. And it had people like Steve Howe from Yes performing on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: Is there a chance that we will hear this music in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, I think yes, because we were all listening to it at least two weeks ago, and that’s exactly what everyone was saying. This music has got to be available. It’s got to be out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: I really want to play this game now … but but the artwork for this game will be out in your next book or calendar?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Some of it will, but it’s in my book, Dragon’s Dream, which was published in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Was it ever possible to actually play the game – did it get that far into development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: No. Henk would probably tell me I’m wrong, but I’m not even sure gameplay was ever fully developed. The overall concept had to be because we couldn’t structure what we did without that, but we were filling in a lot of gaps. Too many gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, we did a lot of things which were done for the first time. At the time, I studied kendo, which is Japanese martial art with the sword. And my sensei had studied medieval European sword and pole arm spear techniques. For the sword fighting, it was broken up into kata, which is attack, defend, counterattack – sequences that were from real techniques. In a fight you could put it together and it looks so amazingly convincing, and you could watch it from any angle. And we we recorded it in motion capture. So it was very realistic. And it was not just because the motion capture is realistic, but because these were genuine sword techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: I know The Tetris Company worked with another company [Digital Eclipse] for an «interactive museum» about Tetris, so I was wondering if something could maybe be saved and published in a similar way?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Well, there is something which is possible. We developed a process that Henk called Track and Field. Track was when the characters followed a specific route, and Field was when they could wander wherever you liked. They couldn’t wander over the whole world because they’d get lost and it would be boring. You had to have a mechanism to bring them back, but you needed them to follow a path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you could do it like a movie where there was a sequence that was completely constructed. You could watch it from different angles, but you it was a complete construction, but then you could break off into a game. If for instance it was like Lord of the Rings, they could be climbing the mountain path, but when they’re in the dragon’s lair, then they’d come into the field – the game aspect, where they can wander wherever they want. But once they’re out again, they’re back on the track.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So there’s bits when you can just watch it, it looks great, and then there’s bits when you’re frantically interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: Did you work on any other interesting projects like this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Before I met either Henk or Jonathan Ellis, we worked on an idea for doing a project called Taitan, which was an arcade game [cabinet]. We said we were going to manufacture the machines ourselves, and talked to Taito Electronics about licensing the motherboards from them. But instead, they decided to buy out our business, so that’s how that went.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Henk Rogers also got involved with a virtual reality project with us. He was the first who saw this, and he invested in it. We built maybe a dozen prototypes. But again, we were too far ahead of the technology. Mitsubishi supplied the monitors … they were the size of a small car. We had to cut great chunks out of the pods we were making. They were very elegant, but we had to cut massive amounts out of them just to fit in the monitors. They were bigger behind than the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: How do you view your game art compared to the rest of the work that you’ve done?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: In many ways, it was like returning to roots for me because I never did do fine art at college. I did Canterbury College of Art for four years, Royal College for three. My focus was on architecture. You know, the I studied basically what kind of spaces made us feel good, what kind of spaces made us feel uncomfortable. And my view is very strongly that modern architecture is not good for us. There should have been a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what I’m very interested in and focused on now. We’re looking to build a visitor center and museum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: Where?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: We’re looking at two sites. They’ll be different. One is in England, near here, near where I live, and one is in California.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JF: Thanks a lot for your time. It’s an honor for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: No, it’s an honor for me. And fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HAJ: Thank you for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RD: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ofcom fines 4chan £20K and counting for pretending UK's Online Safety Act doesn't exist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Regulator warns penalties will pile up until internet toilet does its paperwork&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ofcom, the UK's Online Safety Act regulator, has fined online message board 4chan £20,000 ($26,680) for failing to protect children from harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fine could rise by a further £6,000 – £100 per day for a maximum 60 days – if it continues to ignore its duties to comply with the regulator's request for information regarding two separate matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4chan can stop the additional fines by providing copies of its illegal content risk assessments and information about its qualifying worldwide revenue to Ofcom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enforcement action announced today is months in the making after Ofcom first opened an investigation into the notorious image board on June 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It requested the aforementioned risk assessments on April 14, and to this day 4chan still has not complied, the regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When opening the investigation, Ofcom said it was looking to understand whether 4chan has failed, or is failing, to abide by its duties under the Online Safety Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The watchdog also highlighted that the maximum penalties for these failures, as specified in the legislation, are £18 million ($24 million) or 10 percent of an organization's qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Register contacted 4chan for its side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ofcom's fine is the first made under the Online Safety Act since in-scope organizations' illegal content duties came into force on March 17. It also announced two provisional decisions to take action against file-sharing service Im.ge and pornography service provider AVS Group Ltd for similar failures to respond to information requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Im.ge's case, this relates to its duty to implement measures to prevent the circulation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and AVS Group was rapped over its duty to implement age-check mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both organizations have the chance to appeal Ofcom's findings before it makes a final decision on how to reprimand them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another porn provider, Youngtek Solutions Ltd, is also under an expanded investigation over its failure to respond to information requests regarding age-checking requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech secretary Liz Kendall said: "The Online Safety Act is not just law, it's a lifeline. Today we've seen it in action, holding platforms to account so we can protect people across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Services can no longer ignore illegal content, like encouraging self-harm or suicide, circulating online which can devastate young lives and leave families shattered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This fine is a clear warning to those who fail to remove illegal content or protect children from harmful material. We fully back the regulator in taking action against all platforms that do not protect users from the darkest corners of the internet."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, since March 2025, Ofcom has opened 21 investigations into the providers of in-scope apps and websites, and launched five enforcement programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Playing by the rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In brighter news, others under Ofcom investigation have shown improvements, and several of these cases are now closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four file-sharing services under investigation for their child safety measures avoided further action by geo-blocking UK users, much to Ofcom's delight. Krakenfiles, Nippydrive, Nippyshare, and Nippyspace have all blocked British IP addresses instead of following other measures set out in the regulator's codes of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ofcom said it has closed the cases into these sites, and that the measures have "significantly reduced the likelihood that people in the UK will be exposed to any illegal or harmful content."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We will continue to monitor their availability in the UK and reserve the right to reopen our investigations if we have reason to do so. We are pursuing further lines of inquiry against file-sharing services Nippybox and Yolobit, and these investigations remain ongoing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A suicide forum is also now geo-blocking UK IPs after Ofcom began enforcement proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satisfied for now, the regulator said it will keep tabs on the unnamed provider to see whether that block remains in place over the long term, and ensure it does not provide information on how to bypass it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Imgur yanks Brit access to memes as parent company faces fine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Charities warn Ofcom too soft on Online Safety Act violators&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bypassing these measures has been a hot point of discussion since the Online Safety Act's most noticeable rules came into force in July, triggering a surge in VPN subscriptions within days of Brits having to submit their ID cards for age verification purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While platforms are forbidden from guiding users toward these types of workarounds, this alone is unlikely to prevent VPNs being used to bypass geo-blocks and similar measures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They do not appear to be going anywhere either. The UK government has previously stated that it does not wish to ban them, since they have many legitimate purposes. But if platforms promote VPNs and other workarounds to children as a means to access their services, then Ofcom will pursue action against them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;First look at beefed-up requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among Ofcom's proposed amendments to its obligations to platforms was the requirement for in-scope apps and websites to make use of hash-matching technology, which is seen as a more accurate, automated way of preventing the dissemination of illegal content such as CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hash matching involves a system fingerprinting an image and comparing the hash it generates to a database of known harmful images, which are also hashed. If an image's hash matches or shows signs of similarity with one in the database, then it can be removed entirely autonomously and reported to local authorities for follow-up investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ofcom previously identified "serious compliance concerns" with its CSAM enforcement program at 1Fichier.com and Gofile.io, leading to investigations being opened into them both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After constructive engagement with the regulator, both now deploy hash-matching tech and escaped further action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suzanne Cater, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said: "Today sends a clear message that any service which flagrantly fails to engage with Ofcom and their duties under the Online Safety Act can expect to face robust enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We're also seeing some services take steps to introduce improved safety measures as a direct result of our enforcement action. Services who choose to restrict access rather than protect UK users remain on our watchlist as we continue to monitor their availability to UK users." ®&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oct 13 (Reuters) - Data startups Fivetran and dbt Labs will merge in an all-stock deal, creating a combined data infrastructure company with nearly $600 million in annual revenue, the two companies told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deal is structured as an all-stock exchange based on an agreed ratio tied to revenues and growth rates, Fivetran Chief Executive George Fraser said in an interview. The combined entity is worth more than its last private valuation, Fraser said, but added that the valuation will ultimately be determined by the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fivetran was last publicly valued at $5.6 billion in September 2021, while dbt Labs was valued at $4.2 billion in a Series D round in February 2022. The companies share some investors, including Andreessen Horowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon closing, Fraser will serve as CEO of the combined company, while dbt Labs CEO Tristan Handy will become co-founder and president.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transaction, which unites two highly valued venture-backed startups, marks significant consolidation in the data tooling market as enterprises race to adapt infrastructure for artificial intelligence applications, which require organized access to internal data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The thing is really unique about this combination is our emphasis on open infrastructure and interoperability... as everyone is trying to figure out how to use their business data in the context of AI," Fraser said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oakland, California-based Fivetran specializes in automated data movement, helping companies pull information from various sources into a central data warehouse. Philadelphia-based dbt Labs created dbt, an open-source tool for transforming and preparing that data for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Describing the companies' products as complementary, Fraser estimated that 80% to 90% of Fivetran's customers use dbt's tools. The new company will also keep dbt Core, the popular open-source version of dbt Labs' software, available under its current license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to build a more comprehensive platform for enterprises' data needs, Fraser said, with the increased scale and broader platform strengthening its position for a public listing, even though an IPO is not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraser added that the deal is a merger of equals rather than an acquisition as the new company's board will have representation from both Fivetran and dbt Labs, and that the firm will be near cash-flow break-even.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fivetran and dbt Labs expect the deal to close within a year. The Information had earlier reported on talks between the two firms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI and the Future of American Politics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Americans anxious about the forthcoming 2024 presidential election were considering the malevolent force of an election influencer: artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen plenty of warning signs from elections worldwide demonstrating how AI can be used to propagate misinformation and alter the political landscape, whether by trolls on social media, foreign influencers, or even a street magician. AI is poised to play a more volatile role than ever before in America’s next federal election in 2026. We can already see how different groups of political actors are approaching AI. Professional campaigners are using AI to accelerate the traditional tactics of electioneering; organizers are using it to reinvent how movements are built; and citizens are using it both to express themselves and amplify their side’s messaging. Because there are so few rules, and so little prospect of regulatory action, around AI’s role in politics, there is no oversight of these activities, and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Campaigners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Campaigners—messengers, ad buyers, fundraisers, and strategists—are focused on efficiency and optimization. To them, AI is a way to augment or even replace expensive humans who traditionally perform tasks like personalizing emails, texting donation solicitations, and deciding what platforms and audiences to target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an incremental evolution of the computerization of campaigning that has been underway for decades. For example, the progressive campaign infrastructure group Tech for Campaigns claims it used AI in the 2024 cycle to reduce the time spent drafting fundraising solicitations by one-third. If AI is working well here, you won’t notice the difference between an annoying campaign solicitation written by a human staffer and an annoying one written by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But AI is scaling these capabilities, which is likely to make them even more ubiquitous. This will make the biggest difference for challengers to incumbents in safe seats, who see AI as both a tacitly useful tool and an attention-grabbing way to get their race into the headlines. Jason Palmer, the little-known Democratic primary challenger to Joe Biden, successfully won the American Samoa primary while extensively leveraging AI avatars for campaigning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such tactics were sometimes deployed as publicity stunts in the 2024 cycle; they were firsts that got attention. Pennsylvania Democratic Congressional candidate Shamaine Daniels became the first to use a conversational AI robocaller in 2023. Two long-shot challengers to Rep. Don Beyer used an AI avatar to represent the incumbent in a live debate last October after he declined to participate. In 2026, voters who have seen years of the official White House X account posting deepfaked memes of Donald Trump will be desensitized to the use of AI in political communications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategists are also turning to AI to interpret public opinion data and provide more fine-grained insight into the perspective of different voters. This might sound like AIs replacing people in opinion polls, but it is really a continuation of the evolution of political polling into a data-driven science over the last several decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A recent survey by the American Association of Political Consultants found that a majority of their members’ firms already use AI regularly in their work, and more than 40 percent believe it will “fundamentally transform” the future of their profession. If these emerging AI tools become popular in the midterms, it won’t just be a few candidates from the tightest national races texting you three times a day. It may also be the member of Congress in the safe district next to you, and your state representative, and your school board members.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The development and use of AI in campaigning is different depending on what side of the aisle you look at. On the Republican side, Push Digital Group is going “all in” on a new AI initiative, using the technology to create hundreds of ad variants for their clients automatically, as well as assisting with strategy, targeting, and data analysis. On the other side, the National Democratic Training Committee recently released a playbook for using AI. Quiller is building an AI-powered fundraising platform aimed at drastically reducing the time campaigns spend producing emails and texts. Progressive-aligned startups Chorus AI and BattlegroundAI are offering AI tools for automatically generating ads for use on social media and other digital platforms. DonorAtlas automates data collection on potential donors, and RivalMind AI focuses on political research and strategy, automating the production of candidate dossiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, there seems to be an investment gap between Democratic- and Republican-aligned technology innovators. Progressive venture fund Higher Ground Labs boasts $50 million in deployed investments since 2017 and a significant focus on AI. Republican-aligned counterparts operate on a much smaller scale. Startup Caucus has announced one investment—of $50,000—since 2022. The Center for Campaign Innovation funds research projects and events, not companies. This echoes a longstanding gap in campaign technology between Democratic- and Republican-aligned fundraising platforms ActBlue and WinRed, which has landed the former in Republicans’ political crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, not all campaign technology innovations will be visible. In 2016, the Trump campaign vocally eschewed using data to drive campaign strategy and appeared to be falling way behind on ad spending, but was—we learned in retrospect—actually leaning heavily into digital advertising and making use of new controversial mechanisms for accessing and exploiting voters’ social media data with vendor Cambridge Analytica. The most impactful uses of AI in the 2026 midterms may not be known until 2027 or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Organizers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the realm of political consultants driving ad buys and fundraising appeals, organizers are using AI in ways that feel more radically new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hypothetical potential of AI to drive political movements was illustrated in 2022 when a Danish artist collective used an AI model to found a political party, the Synthetic Party, and generate its policy goals. This was more of an art project than a popular movement, but it demonstrated that AIs—synthesizing the expressions and policy interests of humans—can formulate a political platform. In 2025, Denmark hosted a “summit” of eight such AI political agents where attendees could witness “continuously orchestrate[d] algorithmic micro-assemblies, spontaneous deliberations, and impromptu policy-making” by the participating AIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more viable version of this concept lies in the use of AIs to facilitate deliberation. AIs are being used to help legislators collect input from constituents and to hold large-scale citizen assemblies. This kind of AI-driven “sensemaking” may play a powerful role in the future of public policy. Some research has suggested that AI can be as or more effective than humans in helping people find common ground on controversial policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another movement for “Public AI” is focused on wresting AI from the hands of corporations to put people, through their governments, in control. Civic technologists in national governments from Singapore, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland are building their own alternatives to Big Tech AI models, for use in public administration and distribution as a public good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labor organizers have a particularly interesting relationship to AI. At the same time that they are galvanizing mass resistance against the replacement or endangerment of human workers by AI, many are racing to leverage the technology in their own work to build power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some entrepreneurial organizers have used AI in the past few years as tools for activating, connecting, answering questions for, and providing guidance to their members. In the UK, the Centre for Responsible Union AI studies and promotes the use of AI by unions; they’ve published several case studies. The UK Public and Commercial Services Union has used AI to help their reps simulate recruitment conversations before going into the field. The Belgian union ACV-CVS has used AI to sort hundreds of emails per day from members to help them respond more efficiently. Software companies such as Quorum are increasingly offering AI-driven products to cater to the needs of organizers and grassroots campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But unions have also leveraged AI for its symbolic power. In the U.S., the Screen Actors Guild held up the specter of AI displacement of creative labor to attract public attention and sympathy, and the ETUC (the European confederation of trade unions) developed a policy platform for responding to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, some union organizers have leveraged AI in more provocative ways. Some have applied it to hacking the “bossware” AI to subvert the exploitative intent or disrupt the anti-union practices of their managers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Citizens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the tasks we’ve talked about so far are familiar use cases to anyone working in office and management settings: writing emails, providing user (or voter, or member) support, doing research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even mundane tasks, when automated at scale and targeted at specific ends, can be pernicious. AI is not neutral. It can be applied by many actors for many purposes. In the hands of the most numerous and diverse actors in a democracy—the citizens—that has profound implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conservative activists in Georgia and Florida have used a tool named EagleAI to automate challenging voter registration en masse (although the tool’s creator later denied that it uses AI). In a nonpartisan electoral management context with access to accurate data sources, such automated review of electoral registrations might be useful and effective. In this hyperpartisan context, AI merely serves to amplify the proclivities of activists at the extreme of their movements. This trend will continue unabated in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, citizens can use AI to safeguard the integrity of elections. In Ghana’s 2024 presidential election, civic organizations used an AI tool to automatically detect and mitigate electoral disinformation spread on social media. The same year, Kenyan protesters developed specialized chatbots to distribute information about a controversial finance bill in Parliament and instances of government corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, the biggest way Americans have leveraged AI in politics is in self-expression. About ten million Americans have used the chatbot Resistbot to help draft and send messages to their elected leaders. It’s hard to find statistics on how widely adopted tools like this are, but researchers have estimated that, as of 2024, about one in five consumer complaints to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was written with the assistance of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI operates security programs to disrupt foreign influence operations and maintains restrictions on political use in its terms of service, but this is hardly sufficient to deter use of AI technologies for whatever purpose. And widely available free models give anyone the ability to attempt this on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this could change. The most ominous sign of AI’s potential to disrupt elections is not the deepfakes and misinformation. Rather, it may be the use of AI by the Trump administration to surveil and punish political speech on social media and other online platforms. The scalability and sophistication of AI tools give governments with authoritarian intent unprecedented power to police and selectively limit political speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What About the Midterms?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These examples illustrate AI’s pluripotent role as a force multiplier. The same technology used by different actors—campaigners, organizers, citizens, and governments—leads to wildly different impacts. We can’t know for sure what the net result will be. In the end, it will be the interactions and intersections of these uses that matters, and their unstable dynamics will make future elections even more unpredictable than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, the decisions of how and when to use AI lie largely with individuals and the political entities they lead. Whether or not you personally trust AI to write an email for you or make a decision about you hardly matters. If a campaign, an interest group, or a fellow citizen trusts it for that purpose, they are free to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that Congress or the Trump administration will put guardrails around the use of AI in politics. AI companies have rapidly emerged as among the biggest lobbyists in Washington, reportedly dumping $100 million toward preventing regulation, with a focus on influencing candidate behavior before the midterm elections. The Trump administration seems open and responsive to their appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ultimate effect of AI on the midterms will largely depend on the experimentation happening now. Candidates and organizations across the political spectrum have ample opportunity—but a ticking clock—to find effective ways to use the technology. Those that do will have little to stop them from exploiting it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repo is a full-stack implementation of an LLM like ChatGPT in a single, clean, minimal, hackable, dependency-lite codebase. nanochat is designed to run on a single 8XH100 node via scripts like speedrun.sh, that run the entire pipeline start to end. This includes tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and web serving over a simple UI so that you can talk to your own LLM just like ChatGPT. nanochat will become the capstone project of the course LLM101n being developed by Eureka Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fastest way to feel the magic is to run the speedrun script speedrun.sh, which trains and inferences the $100 tier of nanochat. On an 8XH100 node at $24/hr, this gives a total run time of about 4 hours. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like Lambda), and kick off the training script:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bash speedrun.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, since the script runs for 4 hours, I like to launch it like this inside a new screen session &lt;code&gt;speedrun&lt;/code&gt; (and also log output to &lt;code&gt;speedrun.log&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;screen -L -Logfile speedrun.log -S speedrun bash speedrun.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the screen cheatsheet if you are less familiar. You can watch it go inside the screen session, or detach with &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-a d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail speedrun.log&lt;/code&gt; to view progress. Now wait 4 hours. Once it's done, you can talk to your LLM via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run &lt;code&gt;source .venv/bin/activate&lt;/code&gt;), and serve it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python -m scripts.chat_web&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you're on, followed by the port, so for example http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/, etc. Then talk to your LLM as you'd normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it's green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it's a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;code&gt;cat report.md&lt;/code&gt; file which appeared in the project directory and contains the "report card" of the run, i.e. a bunch of evaluations and metrics. At the very end, you'll see a summary table, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Characters: 333,989&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines: 8,304&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Files: 44&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tokens (approx): 83,497&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;-&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total wall clock time: 3h51m&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Your table might be missing the RL number by default). For a lot more information around the speedrun script and what to look for and expect, please refer to the walkthrough that I posted in Discussions of the repo: "Introducing nanochat: The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, $100 is not enough to train a highly performant ChatGPT clone. In fact, LLMs are famous for their multi-million dollar capex. For our purposes, I think there are two more scales of interest. First is the ~$300 tier d26 model (i.e. depth=26) that trains in ~12 hours, which slightly outperforms GPT-2 CORE score. Second is the $1000 tier (~41.6 hours), just because it's a nice round number. But both of these are not yet fully supported and therefore not attached here in the master branch yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, to give a sense, the example changes needed for the speedrun.sh file to train a GPT-2 grade model d26 only involve three changes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;...
# you'll need to download more data shards for pretraining
# get the number of parameters, multiply 20 to get tokens, multiply by 4.8 to get chars,
# divide by 250 million to get number of shards. todo need to improve this...
python -m nanochat.dataset -n 450 &amp;amp;
...
# use --depth to increase model size. to not oom, halve device batch size 32 -&amp;gt; 16:
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_train -- --depth=26 --device_batch_size=16
...
# make sure to use the same later during midtraining:
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.mid_train -- --device_batch_size=16&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it! The biggest thing to pay attention to is making sure you have enough data shards to train on (the code will loop and do more epochs over the same training set otherwise, decreasing learning speed a bit), and managing your memory/VRAM, primarily by decreasing the &lt;code&gt;device_batch_size&lt;/code&gt; until things fit (the scripts automatically compensates by increasing the number of gradient accumulation loops, simply turning parallel compute to sequential compute).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And a bit more about computing environments that will run nanochat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The code will run just fine on the Ampere 8XA100 GPU node as well, but a bit slower.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All code will run just fine on even a single GPU by omitting &lt;code&gt;torchrun&lt;/code&gt;, and will produce ~identical results (code will automatically switch to gradient accumulation), but you'll have to wait 8 times longer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If your GPU(s) have less than 80GB, you'll have to tune some of the hyperparameters or you will OOM / run out of VRAM. Look for &lt;code&gt;--device_batch_size&lt;/code&gt;in the scripts and reduce it until things fit. E.g. from 32 (default) to 16, 8, 4, 2, or even 1. Less than that you'll have to know a bit more what you're doing and get more creative.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most of the code is fairly vanilla PyTorch so it should run on anything that supports that - xpu, mps, or etc, but I haven't implemented this out of the box so it might take a bit of tinkering.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;nanochat is designed to be short and sweet. One big advantage of this is that we can package up all of the files together and copy paste them to your favorite LLM to ask arbitrary questions. As an example, I like to package up the repo using the files-to-prompt utility like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;files-to-prompt . -e py -e md -e rs -e html -e toml -e sh --ignore "*target*" --cxml &amp;gt; packaged.txt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This includes all py, rs, html, toml, sh files, excludes the &lt;code&gt;rustbpe/target&lt;/code&gt; folder, and chooses the cxml output format. Everything is written to the &lt;code&gt;packaged.txt&lt;/code&gt; file, which atm measures ~330KB (i.e. well below ~100K tokens for a state of the art LLM), and ~8K lines of code in 45 files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I recommend using DeepWiki from Devin/Cognition to ask questions of this repo. In the URL of this repo, simply change github.com to deepwiki.com, and you're off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't invested too much here but some tests exist, especially for the tokenizer. Run e.g. as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python -m pytest tests/test_rustbpe.py -v -s&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;nanochat is nowhere finished. The goal is to improve the state of the art in micro models that are accessible to work with end to end on budgets of &amp;lt; $1000 dollars. Accessibility is about overall cost but also about cognitive complexity - nanochat is not an exhaustively configurable LLM "framework"; there will be no giant configuration objects, model factories, or if-then-else monsters in the code base. It is a single, cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally-forkable "strong baseline" codebase designed to run start to end and produce a concrete ChatGPT clone and its report card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The name (nanochat) derives from my earlier project nanoGPT, which only covered pretraining.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nanochat is also inspired by modded-nanoGPT, which gamified the nanoGPT repo with clear metrics and a leaderboard, and borrows a lot of its ideas and some implementation for pretraining.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Thank you Lambda for the compute used in developing this project.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of open source, and that’s one of the reasons I’m drawn to Android. However, new requirements surrounding sideloaded apps, which will start rolling out in October 2025, may be the most anti-consumer move yet by Google. Mandatory enforcement of the requirement will begin in September 2026 (starting with specific countries), marking a turning point where the freedom to install any app comes with conditions set by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve used apps like NewPipe (a media/YouTube client) and Blokada (an ad blocker) for years now. However, these apps aren’t available on the Google Play Store, so I have to obtain them from third-party sources, such as F-Droid. With Google tightening the rules around sideloaded apps, I fear I may lose access to some of the apps I love most on Android because they aren’t verified. Sideloading isn’t going away, but people may seek alternatives because it may feel like the gates are narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Google actually changed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The rules, the timeline, and what “certified” really means&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google's talk around "verified developers" sounds harmless and, in some ways, helpful. As reported on the Android Developer Blog, it is like "an ID check at the airport which confirms a traveler's identity but is separate from the security screening of their bags." Google's analogy, however, may be oversimplified. When this is enforced, the only way a developer’s app will be installable on devices that include Google Mobile Services (GMS) — which typically provide access to the Play Store — is by completing ID verification using government-issued documents or contact information. This will be rolled out globally in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps will be blocked from installing on most mainstream phones if their developer can't complete this verification. However, there are certain devices that will remain unaffected, even though they are just a tiny fraction of the total devices. These categories include all devices that do not pass Google's certification test, primarily custom ROMs or de-Googled phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, Google is not removing sideloading, but it is redefining and limiting participation in the Android ecosystem by creating a mandatory Google-controlled choke point. While this may be a subtle shift, it clearly takes an open source project from anyone being able to participate (including anonymous or pseudonymous distribution) to only those whom Google allows to participate (via centralized developer identity verification).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Security theater or real gain?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Testing Google’s justification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a rational justification for tightening rules around sideloaded apps. It could be framed as user protection against malicious apps or against bad actors who cloak themselves with fake identities. While this is reasonable, the real question is whether it adds significant security for everyday users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a valid question because security checks already exist. Google Play Protect makes Android secure by scanning sideloaded apps. Android flags unsafe installs, and it’s always given us the choice of blocking apps from unknown sources. Even if these are imperfect, they’re defenses that already exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s new move almost feels like it’s based on the assumption that identity equals integrity. Does a verified government-issued identification equate to user safety? This logic is flawed: historically, we've seen malware slip through the Play Store—signed and “verified”—several times. However, what the new rule does is shift the basis of trust away from existing on-device security warnings and your best judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics may even contend that this new rule erodes your right to make informed decisions about your own devices, and that feels more like selective control. Ultimately, many people may view this as Google’s way of shielding itself from criticism over sideloaded malware and protecting the integrity of its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;There will be collateral damage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The ecosystems that depend on openness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may be the most significant anti-consumer move, simply due to its profound impact. It could hit big developers or commercial apps, as well as entire ecosystems built around freely distributed APKs without verification. F-Droid hosts an incredible number of apps not available on the Play Store. Many of these tools exist because they see a need to operate outside the long, controlling arm of Google. This sideloading rule may make them unavailable on mainstream devices even though they’re safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a risk that also affects indie developers and hobbyists. Certain apps can no longer justify the time, effort, or privacy trade-offs required for identity verification. Many one-off projects and apps for niche communities may fall under this category. Ultimately, what we may end up with is a shrunken ecosystem, and if this happens, it will hurt all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, innovation may be the biggest casualty in all of this. Android is great because of its flexibility. It is an ecosystem for everyone. The imposition of a single, centralized gatekeeper will stifle grassroots innovation, as not everyone will be willing or able to contribute, and this will invariably impact the pace and extent of innovation we see on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The new reality for Android users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Google would argue that the intentions behind the new rules for sideloading apps are to protect and secure users, it will likely feel limiting to many Android users, let alone removing the sense of autonomy on our devices. Of course, sideloading will still be possible, but it creates friction for people who use or make apps that aren’t officially available on the Play Store. The fear is that it may be the beginning of the end for independent developers, hobbyists, and niche app communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are workarounds: using non-certified devices, backing up APKs, or exploring alternative app stores. Sadly, the trade-offs for each workaround may range from technical complexity to potential security risks. You should be careful when sideloading apps on Android. However, one thing is clear: Android's openness is closing. What we don’t know is if it will become a completely closed ecosystem someday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A software update to Jeep 4xE models caused major malfunctions over the weekend – leaving many owners stranded and some in danger after their power failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The culprit appears to have been a buggy "over the air" (OTA) software update to the company’s uconnect software on Friday October 10, which “bricked” vehicles if owners installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Jeep customer support representative on a 4XE forum posted Saturday: “Please exercise extreme caution this evening if you have completed the update. If you have NOT completed the update and see the pop-up, please continue deferring..."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posting as “Kori”, they told Jeep customers on the forum that the issue was “a telematics module box update” – and later added that the software update was cancelled the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not before multiple users across the US had updated their vehicles and suffered the immediate consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Jeep software update issue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some described losing power abruptly whilst driving in the wake of the update. One Jeep owner, Kerry Hollis, who works in IT infrastructure at Wells Fargo, told The Stack: “This was a software change that obviously wasn’t tested thoroughly and was dangerous and could have had life safety implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, for me, I lost propulsion while going at low speed in my neighborhood, so I was able to pull over, restart and limp back to my home. I’ve read stories of others that weren’t in that situation, going at highway speeds, and in traffic...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Stellantis reacted quickly but it shouldn’t have happened..."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added: It’s concerning... that most auto manufacturers and new vehicles even have the ability to be disabled by the manufacturer or even worse, someone with a malicious intent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeep describes unconnect as software that “gives you access to the latest available features and enhancements. Updates can be performed over any password-protected Wi-Fi network. Select vehicles with connected service capabilities are eligible for over-the-air updates,” it adds. (The software can also be found in other marques from parent company Stellantis, but it appears only Jeep brands were affected by this update.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another owner, Stephen Gutowski, owner of the reload.com news site, told The Stack: “On Friday night, my 2024 Jeep Wrangler Willys 4xe asked me to run an update when I got back home. I clicked ‘yes’ without really thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"What's the worst that could happen, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He added: “Well, the next morning, I saw posts on the 4xe Facebook group I'm in that the update essentially bricked the 2024 Wranglers. I'm glad I saw that before I went out to my Jeep because I was prepared for something to maybe be wrong and did a test drive in my parking lot …”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sure enough, after driving maybe a half mile around my parking lot, the Jeep killed the gas and told me to put it in park. The dash lit up like a Christmas tree. The check engine light came on. Worse, it refused to go back into drive. It was just dead where it sat… I was [eventually] able to limp it back to my parking spot. I called my local dealership and they said it was a nationwide issue on at least the 2024 Wrangler 4xes…”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"Pretty scary"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gutowski added: “On Sunday morning I saw Jeep's messages in the 4xe forum and the fix was ota’d to my Jeep. So, I let my car run for 15 minutes and did two power cycles. The check engine light went away, and everything seemed to be working normally again. Took it for a test drive around the neighborhood, and it drove like nothing ever happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It seems like it could have been extremely dangerous if I hadn't read about the problem before taking my car out on the road… imagine if it went dead on the highway. Pretty scary. Honestly, this feels like more of a modern car problem. I doubt this will be the last car to get bricked by an ota update. At least they were able to fix it with an ota update in a day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Posting on 4XE Forums, another Jeep owner going by “EmiK” wrote: “I just had to have my 2024 4XE towed to the dealer because it was having problems recognizing the gears, the CEL [check engine light] came on and it wouldn't drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The dealer called me and said 4 others came in this hour.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another angry customer posted on the 4XE forum that “your negligence could have gotten me and a thousand others killed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;“Wranglers are stopping dead on the HIGHWAY. the highway where most of us are doing 60+mph. dealerships are charging us over $200 for this. i am a marine corps wife, and we haven’t gotten paid due to the shutdown, so i can’t even afford to have them “look” at my car—plus, why should we, as owners, pay for your mess up? i would sue if i was in the position to do so. this lazy and unfinished update is leaving thousands of us stranded with a brick instead of a car. if someone dies from this, expect a damn big lawsuit—i’d be joining that.”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Stack could not reach a Jeep dealership for comment.We have also contacted Jeep owner Stellantis for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Don't push to production on a Friday...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company may want to closely read CrowdStrike’s post-mortem after a buggy software update from the cybersecurity company bricked over eight million Windows computers globally in July 2024, causing cancelled flights, hospital outages and banking errors, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike promised after the incident to roll out stronger software release controls/improve quality assurance. Among other pledges, it said it would start to “implement a staggered deployment strategy… in which updates are gradually deployed to larger portions of the sensor base, starting with a canary deployment…”*&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*Editor's note: This is a fairly basic control and it is striking that so many organisations no longer seem to do this in their rush to push out software updates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Environment variables are a legacy mess: Let's dive deep into them&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming languages have rapidly evolved in recent years. But in software development, the new often meets the old, and the scaffolding that OS gives for running new processes hasn’t changed much since Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need to parametrize your application at runtime by passing a few ad-hoc variables (without special files or a custom solution involving IPC or networking), you’re doomed to a pretty awkward, outdated interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Environment variables.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;export SECRET_API_KEY=2u845102348u234&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no namespaces for them, no types. Just a flat, embarrassingly global dictionary of strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what exactly are these envvars? Is it some kind of special dictionary inside the OS? If not, who owns them and how do they propagate?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where do they come from?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: they’re passed from parent to child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    841 ?        00:00:00 sshd
   1520 ?        00:00:00  \_ sshd-session
   1616 ?        00:00:00      \_ sshd-session
   5521 pts/0    00:00:00          \_ bash
   5545 pts/0    00:00:00              \_ nu
   5549 pts/0    00:00:00                  \_ bash
   5560 pts/0    00:00:00                      \_ ps
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Linux, a program must use the &lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt; syscall to execute another program.
Whether you type &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; in Bash, call &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run&lt;/code&gt; in Python, or launch a
code editor, it ultimately comes down to &lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;, preceded by a
&lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;exec*&lt;/code&gt; family of C functions also relies on &lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SYSCALL_DEFINE3(execve,
		const char __user *, filename,
		const char __user *const __user *, argv,
		const char __user *const __user *, envp)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This system call takes three arguments: &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;envp&lt;/code&gt;.
For example, for an &lt;code&gt;ls -lah&lt;/code&gt; invocation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/ls&lt;/code&gt;is the&lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt;(the executable path),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;['ls', '-lah']&lt;/code&gt;is the&lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;array of command line arguments – the implicit first (“zero”) argument is usually the executable name,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;['PATH=/bin:/usr/bin', 'USER=allvpv']&lt;/code&gt;is the&lt;code&gt;envp&lt;/code&gt;array of envvars (typically much longer).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, all envvars are passed from the parent to the child. However, nothing prevents a parent process from passing a completely different or even empty environment when calling &lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;! In practice, most tooling passes the
environment down: Bash, Python’s &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run&lt;/code&gt;, the C library &lt;code&gt;execl&lt;/code&gt;, and
so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is what you expect – variables are inherited by child processes. That’s the point – to track the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which tools do not pass the parent’s environment? For example, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt;executable, used when signing into a system, sets up a fresh environment for its children.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where do they go?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After launching the new program, the kernel dumps the variables on the stack as a sequence of null-terminated strings which contain the envvar definitions. Here is a hex view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    484f 4d45 3d2f 0069 6e69 743d 2f73 6269  HOME=/ init=/sbi

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This static layout can’t easily be modified or extended; the program must copy those variables into its own data structure. Let’s look at how Bash, C, and Python store envvars internally. I analyzed their source code and here is a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bash&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It stores the variables in a hashmap. Or, more precisely, in a stack of hashmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you spawn a new process using Bash, it traverses the stack of hashmaps to find variables marked as exported and copies them into the environment array passed to the child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side note: Why is traversing the stack needed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each function invocation in Bash creates a new local scope – a new entry on the stack. If you declare your variable with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;, it ends up in this locally-scoped hashmap.&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that you can export a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;variable too!&lt;code&gt;function locallyScoped() { local PATH="$PATH:/opt/secret/bin" export PATH env # &amp;lt;- sees the PATH with /opt/scecret/bin } locallyScoped env # &amp;lt;- sees the PATH without modification&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t have learned this without diving into Bash source. My intuitive (wrong) assumption was that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt;automatically makes the variable global – like&lt;code&gt;declare -g&lt;/code&gt;! Super interesting stuff.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The default C library on Linux: &lt;code&gt;glibc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;glibc&lt;/code&gt; exposes a dynamic &lt;code&gt;environ&lt;/code&gt; array, managed via &lt;code&gt;putenv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getenv&lt;/code&gt;
library functions. It uses an array, so the time complexity of &lt;code&gt;getenv&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;putenv&lt;/code&gt; is linear in the number of envvars. Remember – envvars are not a
high-performance dictionary and you should not abuse them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Python&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python couples its environment to the C library, which can cause surprising inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve programmed some Python, you’ve probably used the &lt;code&gt;os.environ&lt;/code&gt;
dictionary. On startup, &lt;code&gt;os.environ&lt;/code&gt; is built from the C library’s &lt;code&gt;environ&lt;/code&gt;
array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But those dictionary values are NOT the “ground truth” for child processes. Rather, each change to &lt;code&gt;os.environ&lt;/code&gt; invokes the native &lt;code&gt;os.putenv&lt;/code&gt; function,
which in turn calls the C library’s &lt;code&gt;putenv&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the propagation is one-directional: modifying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;os.environ&lt;/code&gt;will call&lt;code&gt;os.putenv&lt;/code&gt;, but not the other way around. Call&lt;code&gt;os.putenv&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;os.environ&lt;/code&gt;won’t be updated.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Liberal format&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel is very liberal about the format of environment variables, and so is &lt;code&gt;glibc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, your C program can manipulate the environment – the global &lt;code&gt;environ&lt;/code&gt; array – such that several variables share the same name but have
different values. And when you execute a child process, it will inherit this
“broken” setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t even need an equals sign separating name from value! The usual entry is &lt;code&gt;NAME=VALUE&lt;/code&gt;, but nothing prevents you from adding &lt;code&gt;NONSENSE_WITH_EMOJI 😀&lt;/code&gt;
to the array.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel happily accepts any null-terminated string as an “environment variable” definition. It just imposes a size limitation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single variable: 128 KiB on a typical x64 Intel CPU. This is for the whole definition – name + equal sign + value. It’s computed as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAGE_SIZE * 32&lt;/code&gt;. No modern hardware uses pages smaller than 4 KiB, so you can treat it as a lower bound, unless you need to deal with some legacy embedded systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total: 2 MiB on a typical machine. This limit is shared by envvars and the command line arguments. The calculation is a bit more complicated (see the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;execve(2)&lt;/code&gt;man page):&lt;code&gt;max(32 * PAGE_SIZE, min(MAX_STACK_SIZE / 4, 6 MB))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a typical system, the limiting factor is the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAX_STACK_SIZE&lt;/code&gt;. Remember, initially the envvars are dumped on the stack! To prevent unpredictable crashes, the system allows only 1/4 of the stack for the envvars.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quirks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the fact that you can do something does not mean that you should. For example, if you start Bash with the “broken” environment – duplicated names and entries without &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; – it deduplicates the variables and drops the nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One interesting edge case is a space inside the variable name. My beloved shell – Nushell – has no problem with the following assignment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$env."Deployment Environment" = "prod"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python is fine with it, too. Bash, on the other hand, can’t reference it because whitespace isn’t allowed in variable names. Fortunately, the variable isn’t lost – Bash keeps such entries in a special hashmap called &lt;code&gt;invalid_env&lt;/code&gt; and still passes them to child processes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The standard format&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what name and value can you safely use for your envvar? A popular misconception, repeated on StackOverflow and by ChatGPT, is that POSIX permits only uppercase envvars, and everything else is undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is seriously NOT what the standard says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These strings have the form name=value; names shall not contain the character ‘=’. For values to be portable across systems conforming to POSIX.1-2017, the value shall be composed of characters from the portable character set (except NUL and as indicated below). There is no meaning associated with the order of strings in the environment. If more than one string in an environment of a process has the same name, the consequences are undefined.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Environment variable names used by the utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1-2017 consist solely of uppercase letters, digits, and the &amp;lt;underscore&amp;gt; ( ‘_’ ) from the characters defined in Portable Character Set and do not begin with a digit. Other characters may be permitted by an implementation; applications shall tolerate the presence of such names. Uppercase and lowercase letters shall retain their unique identities and shall not be folded together. The name space of environment variable names containing lowercase letters is reserved for applications. Applications can define any environment variables with names from this name space without modifying the behavior of the standard utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, POSIX-specified utilities use uppercase envvars, but that’s not prescriptive for your programs. Quite the contrary: you’re encouraged to use lowercase for your envvars so they don’t collide with the standard tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only strict rule is that a variable name cannot contain an equals sign. POSIX requires compliant applications to preserve all variables that conform to this rule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in reality, not many applications use lowercase. The proper etiquette in software development is to use &lt;code&gt;ALL_UPPERCASE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My pragmatic recommendation is…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…to use &lt;code&gt;^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$&lt;/code&gt; for names, and UTF-8 for values. You shouldn’t
hit problems on Linux. If you want to be super safe: instead of UTF-8, use the
POSIX-mandated Portable Character Set
(PCS) – essentially
ASCII without control characters.&lt;/p&gt;
