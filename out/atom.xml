    &lt;p&gt;A local device focused AI assistant built in Rust — persistent memory, autonomous tasks, ~27MB binary. Inspired by and compatible with OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;cargo install localgpt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single binary — no Node.js, Docker, or Python required&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local device focused — runs entirely on your machine, your memory data stays yours&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent memory — markdown-based knowledge store with full-text and semantic search&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Autonomous heartbeat — delegate tasks and let it work in the background&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple interfaces — CLI, web UI, desktop GUI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple LLM providers — Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Ollama&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenClaw compatible — works with SOUL, MEMORY, HEARTBEAT markdown files and skills format&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Full install (includes desktop GUI)
cargo install localgpt

# Headless (no desktop GUI — for servers, Docker, CI)
cargo install localgpt --no-default-features&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Initialize configuration
localgpt config init

# Start interactive chat
localgpt chat

# Ask a single question
localgpt ask "What is the meaning of life?"

# Run as a daemon with heartbeat, HTTP API and web ui
localgpt daemon start&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm generally pretty pro-AI with one major exception: agentic coding. My consistent impression is that agentic coding does not actually improve productivity and deteriorates the user's comfort and familiarity with the codebase. I formed that impression from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every time I use agentic coding tools I'm consistently unimpressed with the quality of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;my experiences interviewing candidates&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I allow interview candidates to use agentic coding tools and candidates who do so consistently performed worse than other candidates, failing to complete the challenge or producing incorrect results1. This was a huge surprise to me at first because I expected agentic coding to confer an unfair advantage but â¦ nope!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;research studies&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Studies like the Becker study and Shen study show that users of agentic coding perform no better and sometimes worse when you measure productivity in terms of fixed outcomes rather than code velocity/volume.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't believe agentic coding is a lost cause, but I do believe agentic coding in its present incarnation is doing more harm than good to software development. I also believe it is still worthwhile to push on the inadequacies of agentic coding so that it empowers developers and improves code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, in this post I'm taking a different tack: I want to present other ways to leverage AI for software development. I believe that agentic coding has so captured the cultural imagination that people are sleeping on other good and underexplored solutions to AI-assisted software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The master cue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to design tools and interfaces from first principles rather than reacting to industry trends/hype and I've accrued quite a few general design principles from over a decade of working in DevProd and also an even longer history of open source projects and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of those design principles is my personal "master cue", which is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A good tool or interface should keep the user in a flow state as long as possible&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This principle isn't even specific to AI-assisted software development, and yet still highlights why agentic coding sometimes misses the mark. Both studies and developer testimonials show that agentic coding breaks flow and keeps developers in an idle/interruptible holding pattern more than ordinary coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Becker study took screen recordings and saw that idle time approximately doubled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe we can improve AI-assisted coding tools (agentic or not) if we set our north star to âpreserve flow stateâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calm technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calm technology is a design discipline that promotes flow state in tools that we build. The design principles most relevant to coding are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;tools should minimize demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Interruptions and intrusions on our attention break us out of flow state.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;tools should be built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A tool is not meant to be the object of our attention; rather the tool should reveal the true object of our attention (the thing the tool acts upon), rather than obscuring it. The more we use the tool the more the tool fades into the background of our awareness while still supporting our work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;tools should create and enhance calm (thus the name: calm technology)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A state of calm helps users enter and maintain flow state.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-LLM examples of calm technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers already use âcalmâ tools and interfaces as part of our work and here are a couple of examples you're probably already familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inlay hints&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IDEs (like VSCode) can support inlay hints that sprinkle the code with useful annotations for the reader, such as inferred type annotations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These types of inlay hints embody calm design principles because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they minimize demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They exist on the periphery of our attention, available for us if we're interested but unobtrusive if we're not interested.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they are built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They don't replace or substitute the code that we are editing. They enhance the code editing experience but the user is still in direct contact with the edited code. The more we use type hints the more they fade into the background of our awareness and the more the code remains the focus of our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they create and enhance calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They promote a sense of calm by informing our understanding of the code passively. As one of the Calm Technology principles puts it: âTechnology can communicate, but doesn't need to speakâ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;File tree previews&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools like VSCode or GitHub's pull request viewer let you preview at a glance changes to the file tree, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might think to yourself âthis is a very uninteresting thing to use as an exampleâ but that's exactly the point. The best tools (designed with the principles of calm technology) are pervasive and boring things that we take for granted (like light switches) and that have faded so strongly into the background of our attention that we forget they even exist as a part of our daily workflow (also like light switches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;File tree previews:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;minimize demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They're there if we need the information, but easy to ignore (or even forget they exist) if we don't use them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;are built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When we interact with the file tree viewer we are interacting directly with the filesystem and the interaction between the representation (the viewer) and the reality (the filesystem) feels direct, snappy, and precise. The more we use the viewer the more the representation becomes indistinguishable from the reality in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;create and enhance calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We do not need to constantly interact with the file tree to gather up-to-date information about our project structure. It passively updates in the background as we make changes to the project and those updates are unobtrusive and not attention-grabbing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chat-based coding agents are not calm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can think about the limitations of chat-based agentic coding tools through this same lens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they place high demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user has to either sit and wait for the agent to report back or do something else and run the LLM in a semi-autonomous manner. However, even semi-autonomous sessions prevent the user from entering flow state because they have to remain interruptible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they are not built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chat agents are a highly mediated interface to the code which is indirect (we interact more with the agent than the code), slow (we spend a lot of time waiting), and imprecise (English is a dull interface).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they undermine calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user needs to constantly stimulate the chat to gather new information or update their understanding of the code (the chat agent doesn't inform the user's understanding passively or quietly). Chat agents are also fine-tuned to maximize engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prior art for calm design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inline suggestions from GitHub Copilot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the earliest examples of an AI coding assistant that begins to model calm design principles is the OG AI-assistant: GitHub Copilot's support for inline suggestions, with some caveats I'll go into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does one thing really well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;it's built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user is still interacting directly with the code and the suggestions are reasonably snappy. The user can also ignore or type through the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, by default these inline suggestions violate other calm technology principles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they demand our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By default Copilot presents the suggestions quite frequently and the user has to pause what they're doing to examine the output of the suggestion. After enough times the user begins to condition themselves into regularly pausing and waiting for a suggestion which breaks them out of a flow state. Now instead of being proactive the user's been conditioned by the tool to be reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they undermine calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GitHub Copilot's inline suggestion interface is visually busy and intrusive. Even if the user ignores every suggestion the effect is still disruptive: suggestions appear on the user's screen in the center of their visual focus and the user has to decide on the spot whether to accept or ignore them before proceeding further. The user also can't easily passively absorb information presented in this way: understanding each suggestion requires the user's focused attention.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦ buuuuut these issues are partially fixable by disabling the automatic suggestions and requiring them to be explicitly triggered by &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;.  However, unfortunately that also disables the next feature, which I like even more:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Next edit suggestions (also from GitHub Copilot)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next edit suggestions are a related GitHub Copilot feature that display related follow-up edits throughout the file/project and let the user cycle between them and possibly accept each suggested change. They behave like a âsuper-charged find and replaceâ:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These suggestions do an amazing job of keeping the user in a flow state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they minimize demand on the user's attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cognitive load on the user is smaller than inline suggestions because the suggestions are more likely to be bite-sized (and therefore easier for a human to review and accept).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they're built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just like inline suggestions, next edit suggestions still keep the user in close contact with the code they are modifying.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they create and enhance calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suggestions are presented in an unobtrusive way: they aren't dumped in the dead center of the user's attention and they don't demand immediate review. They exist on the periphery of the user's attention as code suggestions that the user can ignore or focus on at their leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI-assisted calm technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe there is a lot of untapped potential in AI-assisted coding tools and in this section I'll sketch a few small examples of how we can embody calm technology design principles in building the next generation of coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Facet-based project navigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could browse a project by a tree of semantic facets. For example, if you were editing the Haskell implementation of Dhall the tree viewer might look like this prototype I hacked up2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal here is to not only provide a quick way to explore the project by intent, but to also improve the user's understanding of the project the more they use the feature. "String interpolation regression" is so much more informative than &lt;code&gt;dhall/tests/format/issue2078A.dhall&lt;/code&gt;3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, the above video is based on a real tool and not just a mock. You can find the code I used to generate that tree of semantics facets here and I'll write up another post soon walking through how that code works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Automated commit refactor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could take an editor session, a diff, or a pull request and automatically split it into a series of more focused commits that are easier for people to review. This is one of the cases where the AI can reduce human review labor (most agentic coding tools create more human review labor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is some prior art here but this is still a nascent area of development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;File lens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could add two new tools to the user's toolbar or context menu: âFocus onâ¦â and âEdit asâ¦â.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âFocus onâ¦â would allow the user to specify what they're interested in changing and present only files and lines of code related to their specified interest. For example, if they want to focus on âcommand line optionsâ then only related files and lines of code would be shown in the editor and other lines of code would be hidden/collapsed/folded. This would basically be like âZen modeâ but for editing a feature domain of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âEdit asâ¦â would allow the user to edit the file or selected code as if it were a different programming language or file format. For example, someone who was new to Haskell could edit a Haskell file âas Pythonâ and then after finishing their edits the AI attempts to back-propagate their changes to Haskell. Or someone modifying a command-line parser could edit the file âas YAMLâ and be presented with a simplified YAML representation of the command line options which they could modify to add new options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is obviously not a comprehensive list of ideas, but I wrote this to encourage people to think of more innovative ways to incorporate AI into people's workflows besides just building yet another chatbot. I strongly believe that chat is the least interesting interface to LLMs and AI-assisted software development is no exception to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Getting the correct output wasn't even supposed to be the hard part of the coding challenge. The standard interview challenge provided the candidate with a golden output that their program needed to match and despite that agentic coders would not only fail to match the golden output but sometimes not even realize their program didn't match the golden output because they hadn't even run their agentically coded solution to check if it was correct. The actual hard part of the coding challenge was supposed to be follow-up questions about the journey to production, which vibe coders also performed worse on. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cluster labeler still needs work but you get the idea. â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That's on me since I named the file ð . â©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminals, however, are in many cases based on general purpose architectures, just lashed to restrictive firmware — a good example would be the DEC VT220 which is controlled by our old friend the Intel 8051 — and game consoles likewise fall naturally in this category. Plus, there's a third group of computer-adjacent devices that qualify as well: the video titlers.&lt;/p&gt;Video titlers (also known as character generators) are exactly what they sound like: devices that stamp bitmap data, usually text, on top of a video signal, like this typical example from a 1992 demo video for the consumer-oriented Videonics Video Titler. Distinct from what you might do as part of an editing system, many of these machines operate in real-time and over live video input such as the classic Chyron systems. Today's titlers are usually add-on boards controlled by a standard desktop computer, but for much of their existence they came as standalone devices with their own CPUs and video hardware, and that means they can be potentially hardware-hacked like anything else.&lt;p&gt;Well, Canada, you have your own indigenous video titlers as well, and here's one designed and manufactured in beautiful Montréal: the Scriptovision Super Micro Script, circa 1985.&lt;/p&gt;The Super Micro Script was one of several such machines this company made over its lifetime, a stylish self-contained box capable of emitting a 32x16 small or 10x4 large character layer with 64x32 block graphics in eight colours. It could even directly overlay its output over a composite video signal using a built-in genlock, one of the earliest such consumer units to do so. Crack this unit open, however, and you'll find the show controlled by an off-the-shelf Motorola 6800-family microcontroller and a Motorola 6847 VDG video chip, making it a relative of contemporary 1980s home computers that sometimes used nearly exactly the same architecture.&lt;p&gt;More important than that, though, it has socketed EPROMs we can theoretically pull and substitute with our own — though we'll have to figure out why the ROMs look like nonsense, and there's also the small matter of this unit failing to generate a picture. Nevertheless, when we're done, another homegrown Canadian computer will rise and shine. We'll even add a bitbanged serial port and write a MAME emulation driver for it so we can develop software quickly ... after we fix it first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding filmed art and transparencies, early static television titles were generated by monoscopes, modified cathode ray tubes that fired their electron guns at embedded plates marked with a metallized image. These units then assimilated the reflected particles into a sharp monochrome video signal. Related devices like the 1953 Hughes Typotron or 1954 Convair Charactron used a double-deflection system where an electron beam was first used to illuminate selected glyphs in a perforated stencil anode and then onto the desired position on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;The union of the monoscope with these techniques yielded hybrids like the 1966 Raytheon CK1414 and 1969 RCA 4560, which could produce a display character by character by having a monoscope repeatedly scan subsections of a plate "font" under computer control. The resulting signal was then used to generate each display frame on a second CRT. Although crude and sometimes flickery, these methods yielded sharp clean characters that were clearly more flexible than fixed monoscope images or labouriously creating superimposable high-contrast art with stencils and Letraset sheets. Simultaneously, solid state systems equipped with what we would now call bitmap images, stored in core memory, could string them together on the fly to generate simple fixed-width font displays. In 1970 CBS Laboratories expanded on this technology with the Vidifont, the first video title generator capable of proportional characters. It was sold openly until CBS shuttered the CBS Laboratories division and the Vidifont was further internally refined into a colour-capable version exclusively used for CBS News broadcasts. (CBS later won an Emmy in 1992 for the Vidifont's development.) Meanwhile, Systems Research Corporation, a contractor who provided the Vidifont's "Vidiloop" tape storage system used for creating text off-line before running it on-air, spied an opportunity and got into the market themselves. Their first product in 1971, the Chiron [sic], used the competing 1967 AB Dick Videograph 990 with an improved monospace font and colourized text, supporting creation of full-frame and lower-thirds displays that could be recorded and retrieved. The name was later changed to Chyron due to an existing trade name in California, and renaming themselves after their flagship product, the Chyron Corporation became virtually synonymous with broadcast TV graphics. One of SRC's original founders was Francis Mechner, a research psychologist who had recently sold his company to Xerox and was SRC/Chyron's initial investor, and whose eldest son Jordan Mechner went on to develop games like Karateka and Prince of Persia. Such devices generally produced their output using large and complex assemblies made from discrete components, which also made them prohibitively expensive outside of the studio. Although multi-chip assemblies could generate bit patterns using early types of MOS ROM, the first complete character generator "on a chip" wasn't introduced until 1969, the TMS2400JC series from Texas Instruments. (The earlier Fairchild 3250 character generator could only emit numbers.) Presented with an input — which could come directly from the data bus — these chips would emit a 5x7 character from an internal mask array selectable by row, suitable for conversion to a video signal, with its simultaneous sibling TMS4100JC and TMS4880JC series offering alternative character matrix sizes. This chip family became one of a long series of TI character generators and was used in devices like the Alphacom Terminal Computer, though their output was not sufficiently high quality for general broadcast use. An evolved version of the concept appeared in the 1972 Signetics 2513, best known as the character generator in the original Apple I.&lt;p&gt;By 1980 a number of relatively inexpensive video display chips were available on the open market, all capable of basic text output and even some simple graphics, including the Signetics 2637 Universal Video Interface (UVI), the Texas Instruments TMS9918 Video Display Processor (VDP) and the Motorola 6847 Video Display Generator (VDG). Videotape recording had also gotten less expensive in the meantime, putting it within reach of a sufficiently determined (or financially irresponsible) enthusiast, and these were certainly the very same people who wanted to do their own character work just like the TV studios. It's not exactly clear what would qualify as the first home video titler, and many early home computers were likely used for such a task, but one Canadian company in particular surely has a strong claim.&lt;/p&gt;Scriptovision was founded in Montréal, Québec by Michel and Robert Champagne in 1981. Their inagural product was developed that same year and a strong contender to be our landmark first: the Micro Script, a handheld character generator with a blister keypad that could produce 32x16 text simultaneously with simple 64x32 colour block graphics over composite video. I can find no obvious references to a similar prosumer product prior to theirs, so I proffer it as the winner. The Champagnes produced both fully assembled units and kit parts, with a complete ready-to-go unit available for US$169 [in 2026 dollars about $580] "plus 4.7% import duty" if shipped to the United States. Michel Champagne wrote a two-part article for Radio-Electronics in April and May 1982 discussing its internals and its operation, including a full schematic and images of the printed circuit board. The Micro Script did not have a built-in genlock (short for "generator lock"), which is to say it could not overlay its own output over another video signal, though this also made it less electronically complex and therefore cheaper. Its simple display was nevertheless amenable to being used in that fashion with an external genlock or similar device, such as this still from a YouTube video that employed a slightly later Micro Script Model II. A user could create up to two "pages" of artwork and flip between them instantly, though the device was intended for immediate use as the Micro Script had no facility for saving or reloading its contents. To a certain class of (Tandy or Dick Smith) user, the font in that grab will have given away exactly what was producing the image: a Motorola 6847 ("MC6847") Video Display Generator. The Micro Script is very close to Motorola's reference design, pairing a 6800-family CPU — in this case a Motorola 6802 microcontroller, incorporating an on-chip oscillator and 128 bytes of RAM — with the VDG and two 2114 static RAMs providing the two 512-byte pages of display memory (i.e., 1K). The VDG's Y-Pb-Pr output lines are then connected to a Motorola 1372 ("MC1372") video modulator which in this application directly generates the device's composite output, though the MC1372 can also produce RF for connection to a standard-definition TV. Both the VDG and the MC6802 are driven by a standard 3.58MHz crystal (i.e., 315/88, the NTSC colourburst subcarrier frequency), which the CPU internally divides by four to yield its nominal clock rate of 0.89MHz (315/352).&lt;p&gt;The VDG is a nearly autonomous chip which generates an image from connected memory independently of the CPU. It does not map anywhere in memory per se and it has no external registers for a CPU to manipulate. Forcing a particular mode such as bitmap graphics requires controlling chip lines, which in machines with software-controllable video modes must be provided by extra hardware. On every screen refresh, the MC6847 reads memory and creates a frame based on its option inputs; since character attributes are also selected by chip lines instead of registers, the data bus lines for certain bits are often wired to these lines so that each character cell can have its own attributes, which the chip will consult as it fetches. Here, this is accomplished by wiring bit 6 to both the VDG's data bus and to its Alphanumeric/Semigraphics line, and bit 7 to both the data bus and the VDG's inverse video line. Other mode control lines are hardwired to +5V or ground, limiting this application to the internal character ROM and "semigraphics 4" mode (four blocks per character cell), selectable by cell — interestingly, the 6847's CSS line, selecting one of two text colour palettes, is instead controlled globally using one of the keypad buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the VDG and the CPU must access the same RAM for display, there is an inevitable risk of collision, even with CPUs like the MOS 6502 that are off the bus for much of their machine cycle. Unlike systems like the Tandy Color Computers, the Micro Script has nothing like the 6883 SAM to arbitrate between the CPU and the VDG; the Micro Script's small 2K ROM instead keeps its working data and processor stack in the CPU's internal RAM, only using the 2114 SRAMs for storing characters and semigraphics for display. Two 74LS367 tri-state hex buffers and a 74LS245 octal bus transceiver serve as bus arbitrators, protecting the 6802 from the 6847's bus activity and suppressing the VDG on its MS pin when the CPU accesses the SRAMs (gated via a 74LS138 used for address decoding). Although the MC6847 can generate a signal on its FS pin when it finishes drawing a frame, which in many systems is wired to the CPU's interrupt line, here the CPU's halt, IRQ and NMI (and memory ready, incidentally) lines are all hardwired high. Instead, the 6847's FS line runs to one of the 74LS367s and then to the data bus which the CPU can busy-read as a single bit. The Micro Script's ROM constantly checks this bit, waiting for the precise time it goes low, after which the CPU is guaranteed 32 scan lines where the VDG will not interfere. This period equals 32 times the NTSC horizontal scan time of (1/(13500/858)) milliseconds (~2.03ms), or approximately 440 cycles at the MC6802's clock speed. This number will become important later.&lt;/p&gt;The Micro Script is a very simple architecture, but categorical home computers have been built on designs nearly as uncomplicated. The 1979 APF Imagination Machine paired a 6800 with a 6847, both at the same speed as the Micro Script, and a simple one-channel sound generator. The base unit, the 1978 APF MP1000, was a cartridge game console with built-in controllers sold for a similar price to the Micro Script, and designed to compete against the Atari 2600 with 1K of built-in RAM — which the Micro Script also has. Note that this is not sufficient memory for the VDG's bitmap modes, so to enable better graphics the MP1000 has additional hardware which effectively allows a custom character set to be defined in one 512 byte half and displayed as text from the other. The Imagination Machine accepts the MP1000 and adds a cassette deck, keyboard, more RAM, and expansion options (the unreleased Imagination Machine II consolidated the MP1000 into the chassis). Or how about the VTech Laser 200, perhaps best known in its Australian rebadge as the Dick Smith VZ200 Personal Colour Computer? One of the cavalcade of super-low-end 1983 home systems, this machine pairs up the VDG with a Zilog Z80 instead, though both still ran at the same 3.58MHz speed (despite the PAL locality for AU/NZ). The base 8K VZ-200/Laser 200 system devoted 2K of its built-in RAM to the VDG, just enough for a 128x64 bitmap mode in four colours and the standard text/semigraphics mode, and also used a 74LS245 to gate CPU access to this specific tract of memory. A cheap and well-supported entry to home computing down under, the VZ200 and the upgraded VZ300 were beloved in their adopted home country and we'll be looking at these computers in a future article. Or what about Radio Shack? Tandy, never one to let anyone else define the bottom of the market, had a system like this of their own that was even cloned in France — the TRS-80 MC-10 Micro Color Computer, another low-binned 1983 system that was "new for 1984" in the RSC-10 catalogue. Superficially a stripped-down Color Computer, the MC-10 actually uses a different CPU — the MC6803, more closely related to the 6800 (and 6802) than the CoCo's 6809, and also at 0.89MHz from a 3.58MHz crystal. There's no SAM in the MC-10 to arbitrate the bus either, just another 74LS245 controlling access to its 4K of RAM. Although the 6803 has a serial port which the 6802 lacks, the on-board RS-232 is in fact bitbanged because the 3.58MHz crystal cannot be used to generate any standard baud rate with an integer divider. The machine was hobbled by its intentional design limitations and the poor quality (and quantity) of available software, and after reviewers mercilessly savaged it Tandy slashed the price and discontinued it about a year later. Nevertheless, the MC-10 survived briefly in an alternative French form as the cherry-red Matra Alice, another competitor for the French Plan Informatique pour Tous ("computing for all") school initiative alongside the Exelvision and Thomson systems. Similarly unsuccessful, it nevertheless spawned two direct successors which added more RAM and replaced the MC6847 VDG with a Thomson EF9345, as used in Minitel terminals.&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the Micro Script, other than its ROMs, was not that far divorced in either architecture or capability from contemporary home computers and even some later ones. Indeed, that goes just as much for its follow-on, which is our victim of the day.&lt;/p&gt;The Micro Script and Micro Script II sold well enough (certainly as kits, but based on surviving examples more so as fully-assembled units) for the Champagnes to design a successor, though this time as a fully commercial product for prosumers: the 1985 Scriptovision Super Micro Script, introduced at just under $500 [in 2026 dollars about $1500]. Popular Photography in their October 1985 issue called it "the lowest-priced character generator in a separate unit that we have seen." Sold in a handsome compact custom enclosure with wood trim, it supported the same eight-colour palette and generated two font sizes, with the larger font in any of the eight colours. It also introduced an internal genlock for overlaying output on a connected video signal, a battery backup (with two AAs) for maintaining the contents of RAM, and a separate port for an external RF modulator which could mix the final video output with an audio signal. It must have been a success for the small company, because in this 1987 advertisement they were still selling it, then reduced to $350 [$980], and advertisements for the product continued to run as late as 1989. Since their previous address appears to now be a private residence, I have censored it from this image. A demonstration videotape was available for $10, though I have yet to see it, and it appears no one has digitized it. The Super Micro Script was sold openly, both direct from Scriptovision and through various distributors. While I surmise the Videonics Video TitleMaker family was the best cumulatively selling titler in this class, a conclusion purely based on the number still offered for sale on eBay, the Super Micro Script seems to have sold widely enough to be at least as common today as its ancestor the Micro Script and perhaps even more so. I spotted one a couple months back for cheap because the seller said it wasn't working, and I figured it might make a nice little project enclosure if I couldn't fix it: it has a 5x8 (40 key) keypad which was a bit grimy, a slide fader for controlling the opacity of the generated text overlay, multiple RCA jacks, and power and genlock switches. It came with its wallwart power adapter but no manual or other paraphernalia. Later I found a second example while I was doing the write-up which was fully operational, though it was sold untested since it didn't even come with the wallwart.&lt;p&gt;At the time it arrived, I had no knowledge of the device's architecture or function other than it was an early character generator, and I had yet to find Michel Champagne's complete technical description of its ancestor until I started on the historical research for this article. I'll throw in some "notes from the future" as we go through it, but I'll write this teardown of the Super Micro Script — which I'll abbreviate periodically as the SMS — mostly as I had previously performed it unaided at the time, and it has some unique attributes of its own that we'll have to unravel ourselves anyway.&lt;/p&gt;On the rear are its ports. New on the SMS is a 5-pin DIN port for connecting an external RF modulator, the pinout of which we'll determine shortly. (Keeping the RF modulator external might have also helped them avoid explicitly having to obtain FCC Part 15 certification, which in those days was notoriously strict; see also the Apple II Sup'R'Mod.) However, its native output is still composite, which it provides on both a preview output — the only output the Micro Script provided — and a fully mixed output incorporating the genlock. Video input, audio input and the external power connector complete the set. The serial number is #268910; my second unit is serial #270209. The main assembly is within a sturdy steel sheet-metal case, which surely did well for reducing interference both to and from the unit. I could also hear something rattling inside as I moved it around, so let's get it open. It is released from its moorings on the bottom by unscrewing the feet and lifting the top of the unit off. You can then flip back the top portion with the controls, to which the mainboard is bolted, and then lift the whole thing off the base plate. Immediately the rattling was revealed: the old, old alkaline batteries had come out from their holder. (On my second unit, the batteries had leaked and actually corroded off their own negative lead!) Fortunately, due to the way the mainboard is mounted, they would not have been easily able to leak onto the electronics as long as the unit remained right way up — which is more than I can say for some Apple systems I've encountered. The mainboard PCB is double-sided but only one side has components, so we will concentrate on the other side for the rest of this entry. The Super Micro Script mainboard is about half again as large as the Micro Script's. Although the metal on the PCB carries the legend "SMS 6000 iss[ue] 1A," most of the markings on the board are silkscreened on, including "MICRO SCRIPT" in the lower right corner — but despite this appellation and being evolved from the earlier design, the board bears little resemblance to the original Micro Script PCB even though their IC designations largely match. While the board itself was clearly mass-produced, the hand-numbered UV EPROMs (both apparently 4K D2732As or equivalent) and the appearance of the solderwork suggest final assembly was done manually. (Proudly manufactured in Canada!) This unit must also have been relatively early given the 1983 and 1984 production dates on most of its chips. The 3.579545MHz crystal is the shiny "can" under the EPROM marked "2."&lt;p&gt;Later Scriptovision started using a green consolidated board. This is the one in my second unit and is marked "SMS 6000 iss[ue] 3." We'll come back to this board when we start talking about the Super Micro Script's various obfuscations. I don't know how many board versions there ultimately were.&lt;/p&gt;The CPU is marked AMI S68B02P, a 68B02 in a plastic DIP manufactured by American Microsystems as a second source. The 68B02 is rated to 2.0MHz and substitutes directly for the 68A02 (top clock speed 1.5MHz) and original MC6802 (1.0MHz). Its primary advantage over the original 6800, besides its 128 bytes of on-chip RAM, is an integrated internal oscillator that generates both clock phases from a single source instead of the two inputs required by the 6800. What is almost certainly the main program ROM is next to it, a 4K NEC D2732A marked with the number "1." A small set of jumpers next to it go both to the ROM and to the 74LS138, which suggests they are involved with where it maps in memory, so I left them alone. We'll come back to the 74LS273 and 74LS244 chips above the CPU in this picture when we get to adding a serial receive port; these chips handle much of the system's memory-mapped I/O, including the keyboard lines. On a small daughtercard on the other side of the board sits the VDG, here an MC6847P in a plastic DIP also. The daughtercard is for providing the VDG an external font ROM (marked "2"), a higher quality font than the default one built into the 6847, assisted by the 74LS161 to generate each character's row addresses. This ROM is expected to carry some reasonable number of 8x12 glyphs (stored as 8x16), though the presence of the D2732A main ROM suggested this one was probably one too and therefore would have 256 glyphs to equal 4Kbytes. (We'll confirm later that this is in fact the case.) The daughtercard looks like a factory upgrade, with the VDG's pinout appearing to match the socket it is installed in, but the daughtercard is in there very tight and I didn't want to damage it with a hasty extraction. Also, although the wiring indicates the board could either accept a VDG by itself or a VDG on the font ROM daughtercard, only this unit has a daughtercard — the later issue 3 device consolidates it into the logic board. The Micro Script and Micro Script II don't seem to have supported an external font ROM, so this was new for the Super Micro Script.&lt;p&gt;On the mainboard under the daughtercard we also see the same Motorola MC1372 we saw in the Micro Script, which I already knew was undoubtedly generating the composite output, and was high on my list of suspects if the seller was right about its inability to emit a picture.&lt;/p&gt;Also under the daughtercard are the two 74LS367s we saw in the Micro Script, though at this point I didn't know their exact purpose. However, next to those are what looked like two SRAM chips piggybacked on each other in a most unusual fashion which also appear to be hand-soldered. I couldn't get a light probe on its top to see what it was, but later we'll find out this machine has 4K of RAM and thus these would likely be 2116 or 6116 SRAMs. No other RAMs are visible on the board, so apart from the 6802's internal RAM this dagwood RAM sandwich is all it's got. How we actually deal with its atypical RAM configuration will become a major topic in the second half of this article. Up near the back are the various wires going to the rear ports. The board appears to accept a single +9V DC input, plus ground, video in, video out and +3V from the battery compartment. Although the 6802 has a standby feature that preserves part of its internal RAM with low power from one of its pins, this wouldn't be enough to power the RAM sandwich, so the AA batteries preserve the entire contents of the external RAM instead of the 6802's standby RAM. The rear jacks are here. Notice there are few explicit grounds: instead, the ground portion of the power input and most of the RCA jacks is simply soldered to the sheet metal, the portions around them having the enamel paint scratched off, making the entire case one big common ground. Another set of ground wires goes from the RF modulator to the negative pole of the battery compartment and from the sleeve of the video input. This last one is bolted onto the metal top of a 7805 voltage regulator which is also secured to the sheet metal, making the case an oversized heatsink at the same time.&lt;p&gt;With this view we can now derive the pinout for the RF modulator. If we orient the notch to the top (i.e., have the unit upside down) while we look at the female rear port, numbering the pins from left to right, pin one is audio, pins two and three are tied together to ground, pin four is video and pin five is +9V from the logic board. Except for the voltage, this would match things like a Commodore VIC-20 RF modulator (+6V) or the TI 99/4A's (+12V).&lt;/p&gt;The wallwart that came with the unit is nominally 9V, tip positive (1/8" TRS). However, it's an old unregulated thing and the multimeter read +12V off it, though the voltage might get pulled down to +9V depending on how much current the device draws, so I decided to put it on a bench supply first. Fortunately the power input terminals are easy to access. At +9V it powers on and pulls about half an amp, which would easily reduce the +12V unregulated output into the rated range. I concluded the wallwart was probably fine. But the screen wasn't. Now, I have no manual for this, so I had no idea precisely what I was expecting to see, but no amount of adjustment on our trusty Commodore 1702 monitor would generate a stable picture even though I could see what looked like letters. Eyeballing it, it looked like the horizontal sync was totally shot, and both the preview out and video out jacks generated the same distorted image. On the other hand, the fact I could see recognizable, sensible text strongly suggested the CPU and probably the VDG were both okay. Interestingly, if I messed with the genlock switch enough, I could glitch it into a much better picture — colours were probably wrong and it still flickered, but this gave me hope that possibly even the MC1372 was fine and the real problem lay in the output stage from there, perhaps a bad cap or something. The main menu also responded to me pressing 4 on the keypad to display the colour palette, though this didn't match at all what I would expect from a 6847 nor the example palette painted on the SMS case. But it's alive! We have a pulse and it's talking to us!&lt;p&gt;There was still an outside chance that the MC1372 was bad, but it so happens that for any system with a 6847/1372 combo there's an easy way of finding out, and it can even be installed without altering the logic board: put in a Color Computer composite modification, like the Mark Data Universal Video Driver or one of its modern clones. Now, wait, I hear you say, doesn't the Super Micro Script have composite output already? It does indeed, but the idea is that if the problem is in one of the downstream components between the MC1372 and the video out port, then the comp mod will act as a bypass and generate a proper image on its own output. On the other hand, if the MC1372 or the VDG are at fault, then the picture from the composite mod board will also be bad. Either way we'll be better able to narrow down what broke.&lt;/p&gt;The theory of hooking up the comp mod (this particular one was an eBay purchase; I am not affiliated with this seller or any other) would be the same as for a regular CoCo; we just have to find equivalent points for it on the SMS. The black clip for audio can be immediately dispensed with since this board does not generate sound and the "silver" one for ground (though this clip is more like blue) can go right on one of the copper ground wires. The other clips will need proper board points, though the clips used here are kind of big for getting around the SMS' chip legs, so I buzzed out pin connections for discrete components I could better attach to instead. The red clip for +5V went on the edge side of the R12 resistor where I found a nice strong voltage reading, and the green clip for the MC1372's chroma output, from the chip's pin 7, went on the ports-side of R15.&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I didn't find a component I could attach the yellow clip to for the luma output from the 6847 and I could not get the yellow clip easily around its leg. For the purposes of testing, I got one of my smaller test clips and put that on, and clipped the yellow clip from the comp mod to its wire. I then plugged the 1702 into the output from the comp mod, and ...&lt;/p&gt;... we have a good image! I got out the USB composite capture device and indeed we have beautiful output from the composite board. (The screen grabs in this article have been corrected and cropped to the proper 4:3 aspect ratio but are otherwise unretouched.)&lt;p&gt; While the VDG offers two text colour palettes, green on dark green and orange on dark orange, most computers based on the MC6847 (like the Tandy Color Computers, Samsung SPC-1000, Dragon 32/64, etc.) use the first one. The SMS, on the other hand, exclusively uses the orange palette. This choice is controlled with the CSS pin which the majority of such sysytems — though not the original Micro Script, which made this choice selectable, nor the APF or NEC TREK — hardwire to a unchangeable fixed logic level. As semigraphics and text can coexist in this screen mode, the SMS ROM then uses an all-black &lt;del&gt;rugby team&lt;/del&gt; semigraphics character to extinguish the background around the text, which is why the entire screen isn't dark orange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with this board bypassing everything between the MC1372 and the rear ports, what about the genlock? If I flick on the genlock, the picture — from the comp mod, remember, not from the rear jacks — disappears. After some puzzlement, I realized this could only happen if the genlock switch turns out to change the path of the video signal on the board.&lt;/p&gt;For yuks, I dug out my Emerson VHS deck — yes, for the first time in an Old VCR article, but probably not the last, we're going to use an actual old VCR. This generates a nice clean composite signal of its own as shown on the 1702. I plugged it into the SMS' video input jack and hit the genlock switch once more. Now we actually have a screen again — though remember that this display is coming from the comp mod, not the rear jacks. It's somewhat warped and the character colours have become more desaturated, but we have sync between the VCR and the SMS, and that sync seems to be getting picked up by the mod. Although this implies some portion of the genlock is working, we'll come back to this presently.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, since we're getting really nice low-noise frame captures, let's have a look around. Again, I have no manual for this, so everything I'll demonstrate here was discovered by simple trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;The Micro Script had no main menu, but the SMS does, which pops up immediately on power on. Although seven screens are officially available, this menu itself must surely count as a screen too, so eight times 512 equals our 4096 bytes of RAM. From here you can start a slideshow ("page cycling") or a bottom-line crawl, though these modes are generated from the same set of screens. The speed and content range are all selectable with the number keys, using the up and down arrows to change the value. The asterisk key on the keypad toggles between the main menu and the screen editor. The screens are not cleared when you turn on the machine — because if you have functional batteries installed, you'll just go right back into whatever screens you were designing earlier.&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the screen a little mode line periodically flashes. This tells you, in order, whether you are entering text or semigraphic characters, whether the cursor moves horizontally or vertically, and which of the seven pages is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;To clear the screen, hold down the CLEAR key on the keypad; this will clear the screen to black characters, leaving just the blue cursor and the mode line. This only affects the current page, so to clear other pages you must switch to them first. You could do so by starting a slide show and hitting asterisk when you get to the one you want, or you could also just go directly to a page by number by pressing the PAGE key on the keypad and then the page number (1-7). Regular text is entered by simply typing it on the keypad. There is no lowercase with the default font ROM, so the SHIFT key handles things like punctuation symbols and even numbers. Text only appears in the basic orange-on-not-so-bright-orange colour scheme, even if the COLOR key is pressed; there is no "inverse" capability even though the VDG is perfectly capable of displaying it. Notably, the ERASE key doesn't place a space on screen (if it did, it would be dark orange): instead, it uses the semigraphics 4 character that is entirely black. By pressing the ZOOM key, enlarged 3x4 characters can be generated. These may appear in multiple colours selected by the COLOR key because they are in fact semigraphics 4 as well. Since 32 is not evenly divisible by three, characters on the far edge will wrap, and this is almost treated like a feature as the device will let you place a character at a "subcharacter" location for precise positioning. The cursor is yuuuge in this mode, but the cursor and the flashing status line may be temporarily quelled with the CURSOR ON OFF key. It is also possible to manually select and place semigraphic characters directly with CHAR/GRAPHIC. When in this mode, ZOOM cycles through the available characters and COLOR through the available colours. The ability to generate a slide show by placing content on multiple screens should be obvious, and the ROM supports this, but it's less obvious how this works with the bottom crawl mode. We'll put some more big text here to show you how that looks since it can crawl both regular and zoomed characters. Interestingly, while the slide show has no problem with all seven available screens, you may not use the seventh one in crawl mode, probably for buffering purposes. (The menu occupies the remaining eighth screen.) We'll retract it to screen six and then start the scroll. Scroll speed is also adjustable using the delay setting, the same one used for the delay between screens, which can be from one (fastest) to thirty (slowest). The scroll routine runs text from the top of each screen, left to right, top to bottom. It is also smart enough to know the difference between regular and zoomed characters: if it detects what it thinks are semigraphics, it will take it as a four-row block. This mostly works for other kinds of graphics, even if the art doesn't exactly match those dimensions. The scroll continues through all the screens you specify, even if they contain junk (in that case they undoubtedly have semicharacters in them and get taken as four-row blocks too). We'll stop it here. It is possible to lay down vertical strips of characters with HOR./VERT., but these don't rotate the actual glyphs, of course. This is less useful in the scroll mode because how many characters of a vertical strip end up in the scroll depends on whether the routine sees semigraphics there or not: ... but it's still handy for certain types of slide displays.&lt;p&gt;The next two orders of business would be to dump the ROMs for posterity and hopefully study, and then to see what we could do with the genlock.&lt;/p&gt;Being vanilla 2732A EPROMs, the two internal ROM chips can be read in pretty much anything, and I got good reliable dumps of both. Since we're most interested in the main code, we'll now rig up a ROM emulator so that we can modify it. I am not affiliated with My Geeky Hobby, but he makes a very nice Arduino-based open-source ROM emulator kit. This can take a binary (for testing purposes, our dump) and present it in multiple configurations as if it were an actual ROM. It includes a probe that replaces the ROM itself. To get the probe to clear the nearby wires and components without contacting them, I put a strip of electrical tape over the exposed sections and then mounted the probe in another socket to give it a little extra height. Since the 2732A is only 24 pins, the remaining four (the probe is 28-pin) dangle. The emulator runs fine this way except it can't draw +5V from the board, meaning it must always be connected to USB power (which for our purposes is no problem). Starting the system up with no ROM image loaded intentionally to make sure there were no shorts. The CPU is just reading open bus and the RAM is full of garbage, but we have a picture, so we probably didn't kill anything. Loading our ROM 1 dump into the emulator and resetting the SMS, we get the menu, so we are now in fully working order. Next, let's see if we can get the genlock running. I took two snapshots from my crappy handheld oscilloscope of the output from the internal preview out (top) and the composite bypass (below). The bottom signal from the bypass shows a decent NTSC composite waveform: the sync tip (drop), followed by the colourburst, the black level (flat), and then the horizontal lines. By contrast, the internal video isn't generating anything recognizeable as vertical sync and the horizontal lines seem to have abnormally small amplitude. For all that, though, when we connect the monitor to the genlocked output using our VCR again as the composite signal, we do get a picture. It's distorted and not fully stable, but it's legible. Interestingly, it is also entirely monochrome — the colour is not in fact overlaid, suggesting this is entirely being generated solely by the luminance output from the VDG and not the chroma information. The MC6847 emits these signals on separate pins. This also means that the output of the VDG used for the genlock is likely a completely parallel pathway from the preview output and we'll need to deal with them separately.&lt;p&gt;I have no schematics for this board and while it is certainly derived from the Micro Script, the Super Micro Script has of course moved some components around, some are difficult to access because of the font daughterboard, and obviously I have no documentation of the genlock side. I did some work figuring out where signal paths went and left some notes to myself on the PCB. However, it was straightforward to determine the composite signal from the MC1372 is eventually funneled into a large capacitor at the top before it feeds the preview output.&lt;/p&gt;Since we know the bypass generates a nice picture, I decided to simply use it for the preview output (and, when the genlock is off, the main video output) instead of potentially making a mess by attempting to repair the board directly. I also didn't want to make any irreversible modifications either, but the capacitor has nice long leads and makes a good point to splice in the output from the bypass, so I clipped the input side to isolate it since even a dolt like me could solder that much back together if needed. There isn't much length on the bypass output to wire that directly to the preview output, so I chopped up a cable with enough length. Next, I got out the soldering iron, soldered the other end of the cable from the bypass to the preview jack, and also cleaned up the wiring from the luminance pin so we didn't need the "double clip" anymore. However, there is nothing here that can't be easily undone either. To ensure this can all fit back into the enclosure, I moved the bypass inside of the metal exterior under the jacks and looped the internal cable back around to the top. The signal got a bit noisier after that. The internal cable admittedly ended up being longer than it needed to be (which can make it into a big antenna), and there might also be some additional RF interference from the board components since the bypass is now jammed inside an effective Faraday cage with them. Here's a comparison grab from the issue 3 unit which we'll use as an example of the machine's intended quality. There's still a bit of fringing, although the issue 3 board is more consolidated, so it may well have better components (I'll show you a picture of the internals a little later). But I'd say for now our repair is good enough and everything fits within the box. Doing some more buzzing out of interconnections, the genlock path turns out to run through several adjustment points. The most important two seemed to be R27, a largish variable resistor which controlled the strength of the VDG luminance signal (distinct from the fader slide), and C15, a variable capacitor. I'm not sure what that one exactly does to the signal but tweaking it did stabilize the picture at the expense of compressing the VDG output a bit horizontally. (Later I compared this with the working issue 3 and found that its genlock overlay also doesn't quite match the geometry of the preview output, so perhaps this is something about the circuitry.) Nevertheless, with these adjusted, you can compare the width of the display to the non-genlocked version above. To avoid any takedown notices by using actual movie grabs in this blog — except for the absolutely necessary SCTV joke earlier, rest in peace, Catherine O'Hara — I pulled out one of our family home VHS movies from when we went to Universal Studios Hollywood in 1990 and stuck that in the VCR. Here the fader slide is all the way down, so you just see the video. This was the Animal Actors' Stage live show which closed in 2023. And here it is with the fader back up. There's no shadowing or emphasis around the letters, unfortunately, so they can get blown out in bright portions of the picture. Here is your humble author attempting to shake hands with Frankenstein's monster. He won. And here are the colour bars as they appear with genlock on and off. Our blue and red strips have a bit of artifact colouration in the genlock view, though this may be because of the horizontal compression. I think this is as good as we can get at repairing it without a schematic to make additional guesses.&lt;p&gt;Back to the firmware. Since we have a known good dump of the ROM, let's try to hack it — and that's where the real fun starts. Here are the last 128 bytes of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;00000f80 52 9f e1 cf 81 bb 7e 72 61 08 7b 82 a4 01 cf ff |R.....~ra.{.....| 00000f90 c9 61 84 04 9c 60 49 32 49 1f ff 01 de e9 d1 c0 |.a...`I2I.......| 00000fa0 90 5a 46 ff 9c 64 00 32 e1 71 71 04 39 f8 b1 2c |.ZF..d.2.qq.9..,| 00000fb0 64 28 b1 2a 7e e1 e7 82 08 d4 cf a2 9f c0 52 ff |d(.*~.........R.| 00000fc0 76 76 6c ff 55 1f 65 81 a0 7e 8c 82 00 84 10 ff |vvl.U.e..~......| 00000fd0 ec 5f 84 01 99 64 18 01 b3 10 bd a2 00 f1 01 b0 |._...d..........| 00000fe0 61 18 84 ff cf 11 c3 08 99 00 7b c2 84 f0 40 3e |a.........{...@&amp;gt;| 00000ff0 76 98 ee 04 bd a8 64 4a 08 10 a4 59 42 bd 1f 0e |v.....dJ...YB...|&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very odd. The reset vector at $fffe-f appears to be $1f0e (the 6800 is big-endian), which is plausible, because it's possible the ROM could be mapped at multiple locations. However, the other vectors for IRQ, software interrupts and NMIs are bogus. Plus, when we try disassembling the putative reset routine from offset $0f0e (following the assumption the ROM is also visible at $1000), we get gibberish:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% ../f9dasm/f9dasm -6802 -offset 1000 sms1.bin [...] Z1F0E ADCB $FF,X ;1F0E: E9 FF '..'

CMPA M01BD ;1F2A: B1 01 BD '...'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way this would do anything useful because the X register and stack pointer haven't been initialized to a predictable value before they're used. Plus, we end up executing an undefined opcode ($7b) right in our code path, which likely is treated the same as DEC, but makes no sense with the bytes after it. Most of the ROM is in fact this same sort of gibberish; nothing looks clearly executable. Also, we don't see any strings corresponding to the menu text in any obvious encoding. For example, we would reasonably expect to find a byte sequence like $13, $05, $14 plus some offset (e.g., $53, 45, $54) to match "SET" somewhere, but we don't. Yet the dump must be good, because the ROM verifies and works when we run it through the ROM emulator.&lt;/p&gt;Arcade game hackers have already guessed: the ROM must be encrypted somehow. Indeed, it looks like Scriptovision themselves were quite concerned about knockoffs; the later issue 3 board in my second Super Micro Script has all the chip markings blotted out (quite a few arcade boards did this too, as it happens), and our adjustment points have also been potted with some sort of glue to discourage any mucking around. If you didn't know what chips were there — and didn't have access to back issues of Radio-Electronics to try to match the silkscreened IC numbers — you'd have very few clues to guess at what the ROMs should contain. There would have been a good chance if I'd ended up first with this later unit that you'd be reading a droll and shorter article about the new enclosure I made out of a video titler instead.&lt;p&gt;Still, this is 1985, where things like public key cryptography in hardware of this sort would be unheard of, and there are no chips visible on either board that would plausibly store an encryption key for something like XOR. There is only this ROM and the font ROM. Otherwise, all the visible logic and ICs are off-the-shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if it's not a chip on the board that does the decryption, what about the board itself doing the decryption? The most obvious technique would be to scramble the address and/or data lines between the ROM and the CPU, and this method was not uncommon either in devices of the era: for example, several Commodore 64 cartridges do this, as do certain cartridges for the Neo Geo. This doesn't prevent someone from doing a bitwise copy of the ROM(s), which is what we did, but it does prevent using them in another board where the address and data lines aren't swizzled around in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;Lo and behold, the same thing has occurred here. I did some checks with my continuity tester, theorizing that since the CPU and the main ROM are next to each other they would be directly connected to each other without any intervening components, and indeed they are — but not on the pins I was expecting. Using a silver Sharpie to mark my findings, both the address and data bus lines between ROM 1 and the CPU are swizzled in multiple places (only the lowest 12 address pins need be checked, though, since the ROM is only 4K). I wrote a simple-minded Perl script to unscramble the binary bitwise and looked at the output. The most immediately interesting part is the last 192 bytes.&lt;quote&gt;00000e40 0b 53 45 54 2d 55 50 20 50 41 47 45 17 31 80 80 |.SET-UP PAGE.1..| 00000e50 80 80 43 48 41 4e 47 45 20 44 45 4c 41 59 20 20 |..CHANGE DELAY | 00000e60 20 20 20 20 17 32 80 80 80 80 53 45 4c 45 43 54 | .2....SELECT| 00000e70 20 46 49 52 53 54 20 50 41 47 45 20 17 33 80 80 | FIRST PAGE .3..| 00000e80 80 80 53 45 4c 45 43 54 20 4c 41 53 54 20 50 41 |..SELECT LAST PA| 00000e90 47 45 20 20 17 34 80 80 80 80 44 49 53 50 4c 41 |GE .4....DISPLA| 00000ea0 59 20 43 4f 4c 4f 52 20 42 41 52 20 17 35 80 80 |Y COLOR BAR .5..| 00000eb0 80 80 53 54 41 52 54 20 50 41 47 45 20 43 59 43 |..START PAGE CYC| 00000ec0 4c 49 4e 47 17 36 80 80 80 80 53 54 41 52 54 20 |LING.6....START | 00000ed0 43 52 41 57 4c 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 05 50 52 45 |CRAWL .PRE| 00000ee0 53 53 02 54 4f 0e 46 49 52 53 54 20 50 41 47 45 |SS.TO.FIRST PAGE| 00000ef0 3a 80 80 80 0e 4c 41 53 54 20 20 50 41 47 45 3a |:....LAST PAGE:| 00000f00 80 80 80 09 44 45 4c 41 59 3a 80 80 80 12 49 4e |....DELAY:....IN| 00000f10 56 41 4c 49 44 20 53 45 4c 45 43 54 49 4f 4e 21 |VALID SELECTION!| 00000f20 1e 49 4e 56 41 4c 49 44 20 46 49 52 53 54 2f 4c |.INVALID FIRST/L| 00000f30 41 53 54 20 50 41 47 45 20 4e 55 4d 42 45 52 10 |AST PAGE NUMBER.| 00000f40 4e 4f 20 44 41 54 41 20 54 4f 20 43 52 41 57 4c |NO DATA TO CRAWL| 00000f50 15 55 53 45 20 55 50 20 4f 52 20 44 4f 57 4e 20 |.USE UP OR DOWN | 00000f60 41 52 52 4f 57 53 1f 50 41 47 45 20 37 20 43 41 |ARROWS.PAGE 7 CA| 00000f70 4e 4e 4f 54 20 42 45 20 55 53 45 44 20 46 4f 52 |NNOT BE USED FOR| 00000f80 20 43 52 41 57 4c ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | CRAWL..........| 00000f90 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |................| 00000fa0 02 04 fe 4c 02 05 fe 64 02 06 fe 7c 02 08 fe 94 |...L...d...|....| 00000fb0 02 09 fe ac 02 0a fe c4 0a 00 fe 40 00 02 fe dc |...........@....| 00000fc0 0d 02 fe e2 04 0c fe e5 04 0d fe f4 14 0c ff 03 |................| 00000fd0 ff 1b 0c 00 02 10 0c 00 00 10 0d 00 01 ff ff 0d |................| 00000fe0 ff 20 ff 3f ff 50 ff 66 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |. .?.P.f........| 00000ff0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff f9 99 ff ff f1 d0 |................|&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see our menu strings, so we must have descrambled it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would Scriptovision do this? My guess is because it's all off-the-shelf components, this prevents a competitor from using their ROM code in anything but another Super Micro Script unit or exact clone. It doesn't prevent reading the ROM but it does make it more difficult to modify or rip it off completely, and though I don't claim to be an expert in copyright law (let alone Canadian copyright law), it might also provide them with a plausible case of infringement if a competitor, failing to grok the scrambling mechanism, nevertheless manufactured a functional copy of the unit with the same ROM in it because the ROM can be copyrighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now that we understand the process, I created a scrambler that reverses the process, ran the scrambler on the unscrambled binary, confirmed the hashes matched, and sent the re-scrambled version to the ROM emulator. The SMS worked just the same as it did before, so the machine is now fully pwned. We can write arbitrary code, scramble it and have the SMS run it. Yee haw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that solved, let's analyze the code further to see what we can make the hardware do. The reset vector points to $f1d0 and the software interrupt vector to $f999. The other IRQ and NMI vectors are nonsense, so we assume that like the Micro Script there are also no IRQs or NMIs in this system. Disassembling from $f1d0, the reset code is now much more sensible. It starts off like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;hdlr_RST LDS #M007F ;F1D0: 8E 00 7F '...' CLR &amp;gt;M000F ;F1D3: 7F 00 0F '...' JSR ZF4F0 ;F1D6: BD F4 F0 '...' LDAB M0005 ;F1D9: D6 05 '..'

[...]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sets the stack pointer to $007f, which is at the end of the 6802's built-in RAM, and then proceeds to do some opaque calls and tests we don't understand at the moment. We'll come back to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept and basic primitive we should first figure out how to write to the display. The VDG uses its own private access to RAM to draw the screen, but this says nothing about where that RAM is mapped in the CPU's memory map, and the reset routine at $f1d0 is not immediately informative because we don't know what most of it does yet. However, we do know where in ROM our menu strings are, and that gives us a critical clue: the only place our set-up page string at $fe40, assuming the first byte is a length byte, is referenced is at $ffba (the 6800 is big-endian). This pointer is surrounded by what is obviously data, not 6800 assembly, but we can guess from the position of SET-UP PAGE on the screen that the two bytes before it are the X,Y coordinate. If so, then it must be part of that larger block of multiple such "records" starting at $ffa0 and bordered on both ends by $ff bytes. This block would be undoubtedly referenced somewhere by the X register, so we should look for where X gets explicitly set to that value, and we find it occurs in two places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% grep LDX disas.txt | grep FFA0 ZFCCE LDX #ZFFA0 ;FCCE: CE FF A0 '...'

We can surmise this because it is alternating between two values for X, one stored at $0014 (since this is loaded from, it must be the string in ROM) and the other at $0018 (since this is stored to, it must be the pointer to video memory). This loop uses B as a counter, set to the length of the string by $fcf1. The pointer at $0018 is initialized by the two calls at $fceb to $f38b and $f399:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ZF38B PSHB ;F38B: 37 '7' CLRB ;F38C: 5F '_' ASLA ;F38D: 48 'H' ASLA ;F38E: 48 'H' ASLA ;F38F: 48 'H' ASLA ;F390: 48 'H' ASLA ;F391: 48 'H' ROLB ;F392: 59 'Y' STAA M003A ;F393: 97 3A '.:' STAB M0039 ;F395: D7 39 '.9' PULB ;F397: 33 '3' RTS ;F398: 39 '9' ZF399 LDAA M003A ;F399: 96 3A '.:' ORAA M003B ;F39B: 9A 3B '.;' STAA M0019 ;F39D: 97 19 '..'

RTS ;F3A5: 39 '9'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;$f38b does a 16-bit shift of A by 5 (to A and B), which of course is multiplying it by 32, since it's the Y coordinate and the video matrix is 32x16. $f399, which is called immediately after, takes the result that $f38b stored in memory and logical-ORs its low byte with the X coordinate (stored at $fce9) and its high byte with $80. The high byte and low byte populate that store pointer at $0018. This suggests our video memory must start at $8000, or at least it does when the menu is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is enough to make a tiny driver in MAME to see how it actually executes. Initially I did this largely based on the Tandy MC-10 driver (of course) but also with some study of the VDG implementation in the Samsung SPC-1000 and Dragon drivers. You can get this from this article's Github project. There is a draft for each stage of the evolution of the Super Micro Script MAME driver, so you can use this as a means to learn how to write your own MAME driver.&lt;/p&gt;To my disappointment, but not really surprise, I didn't get anything on the screen initially (this is in draft1.cpp). However, I could see in the MAME debugger that if we write manually to $8000, characters show up. I could also see that the ROM did start but quickly settled into an infinite loop within this routine before writing anything:&lt;quote&gt;ZF8C7 PSHA ;F8C7: 36 '6' ZF8C8 LDAA M6000 ;F8C8: B6 60 00 '.`.'

In fact, our string display routine above at $fcf7 calls this routine (at $fcf4) just before it starts writing to our presumed video memory, which strongly suggests we are waiting for the VDG to signal we can write there without interference. As I did most of this work before I found the Micro Script article, I didn't know how that system (or this one) implemented this flag. While the Motorola datasheet says the signal (called the "negative field sync") would typically be hooked up to the IRQ line, we know the Super Micro Script can't support hardware IRQs because its IRQ vector is bogus. Instead, this code shows that it too simply busy-waits. We'll program our MAME driver to map changes to the FS line into this location's flag bit, and with that sorted out (draft2.cpp), we have a menu!&lt;/p&gt;The colours are wrong, though, and we're not using our font ROM, which (surprise!) also needs to be unscrambled. The problem here is that only the data lines from the ROM actually go to the VDG. The VDG instead relies upon a separate chip to generate the row addresses for the lower four bits (in this system and in the Motorola datasheet a 74LS161 4-bit counter is used), and display memory itself indexes the remaining eight: the VDG's own address lines are only ever used for talking to video RAM. I worked out the transposed data lines with the continuity tester, but I could only figure out the four lines to the 74LS161, especially since getting to the RAM (which may itself have scrambled lines, so no guarantees anyway) would require removing the stuck daughterboard. Consequently, this process would have been easier on the unified issue 3 board in my second SMS, but I hadn't bought it yet.&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have an alternative: unlike the main ROM, where we didn't know exactly what we would see, we know the bit pattern the ROM generates for letters because it displays them onscreen, so we can work out the patterns that we should see. The character data is stored "horizontally" like the font ROM in the Dragon 200E (i.e., line one for each glyph followed by line two, etc., instead of all lines for a single glyph followed by the next). If we rearrange them into that more familiar "vertical" format, we see distorted shapes which are nonetheless recognizeable as letters, numbers and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;** |60 ***** * |fa * ** * |9a ***** * |fa * ** * |9a * ** * |9a ********|ff ********|ff **** |f0 * ** * |9a * ** * |9a ***** * |fa * ** * |9a |00 ********|ff ********|ff **** * |f2 * ** * |9a ***** * |fa ***** * |fa * ** * |9a **** * |f2 ********|ff ********|ff ***** * |fa * ** * |9a **** * |f2 * ** * |9a ***** * |fa |00 ********|ff ********|ff&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives us enough visual clues, combined with our tests of the data lines, to descramble the font ROM as well. It turned out only the data lines and the 74LS161 lines were scrambled; the lines back to the display memory were not. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character set does have some gaps in it. These gaps are for characters that can't be entered on the keypad (specifically @, [, \, ], ↑, ←, &amp;amp;, *, ;, &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;). Rather than creating glyphs for them that would never be shown except in uninitialized RAM, Scriptovision instead simply chose to make them solid blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to make sure we weren't dealing with different versions or boards, I pulled and dumped the ROMs from my later issue 3 device and to my great relief its main and font ROMs have identical hashes to my original issue 1a unit. I suspect they kept them the same likely because it would have required the overhead of stocking different ROMs for each board revision.&lt;/p&gt;While adding font ROM support I also made sure the CSS bit was being set for each character and that we were using semigraphics 4 for graphics. At this point we now have an emulator appearance approximately like our display (draft3.cpp). Still, the colours are a wee bit different, so let's sort out the keypad next so we can bring up the colour bars for comparison. After the menu comes up the ROM ends up kicking around in this loop:&lt;quote&gt;ZF81F LDX #M2500 ;F81F: CE 25 00 '.%.' ZF822 LDAA #$1F ;F822: 86 1F '..' ORAA M0003 ;F824: 9A 03 '..'

RTS ;F832: 39 '9'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this was prior to my finding that article, so I had to derive things by hand with the knowledge that a common way of decoding a switch matrix, which of course keypads and keyboards are, is to energize each row or column as a group and then see what result you get. I don't know yet what $03 is doing (this is part of the 6802's internal RAM) but our theory then is $2000 is the I/O register for picking a group and $4000 is the result. During this routine $03 is set to $c0. If we look at the call stack (we know from our reset routine that this starts in 6802 internal RAM at $007f and grows down), this routine got called from $fb27, which is very near where the menu got drawn at $fb21 (calling $fcce, which we dissected above) and just after another screen routine at $fd15:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ZFB1E JSR ZF858 ;FB1E: BD F8 58 '..X' ZFB21 JSR ZFCCE ;FB21: BD FC CE '...'

JMP ZFCC2 ;FB34: 7E FC C2 '~..'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keypad is 5x8. Because we're apparently using a mask of $1f (from $f822, i.e., bottom-most five bits set) and looking at the entire 8-bit result in $4000 (the coma instruction at $f82c would complement every single bit), we are most likely either selecting every column or no column, at which point the byte is read. That means the routine at $f81f could either be waiting for a keypress or making sure there isn't one; at this point I couldn't tell yet for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we can guess that the normal situation if no key is pressed is all bits set because we complement A and re-enter the loop at $f82c if not equal to zero. Following this theory, if we alter our driver to presumably always say no key is pressed (i.e., always return $ff when $4000 is read from) and use the MAME debugger to set a watchpoint on $2000 (wpset 0x2000,1,w), we see this sequence from startup: $c0 (at $f45f) twice, then $df repeatedly in the loop at $f81f until the countdown terminates, then a repeating $cf $d7 $db $dd $de from yet another routine at $f311 that appears to do the actual keyscan. Do you see the pattern? Put more plainly,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% perl -e 'foreach (0xcf,0xd7,0xdb,0xdd,0xde){print unpack("B8",pack("C", $_))."\n";}' 11001111 11010111 11011011 11011101 11011110&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... the column is selected by whichever of the lowest five bits is zero. (This means the routine at $f81f is actually waiting for no keys to be pressed because $df shouldn't energize any columns.) This suffices for draft4.cpp. Now the only guess left is in which direction the key bits and column bits go.&lt;/p&gt;As a very lucky first guess, if we return 254 (i.e., 11111110) when there is a zero in the second column from the right (i.e., 11011101), the menu persistently thinks the two key is being pressed. So now we can simulate a keypress of 4 by returning 254 when there is a zero in the second column from the left (11010111), and this finally displays our colour bars (draft5.cpp): This clearly doesn't match what we saw previously, so we'll manually sample the palette on our video captures both here and in the menu and wedge in a custom palette for the MAME VDG driver. At last we have an accurate screen, so let's finish hooking up the keys. This requires creating INPUT_PORTs in MAME which is tedious but in the end "just works" combined with a simple function to query those input port keymappings based on the column in $2000 and push the correct bits to $4000. It isn't apparently possible to have multiple PORT_CODEs in our MAME ports definition, so we define alternate rows with the numbers for convenience and query those at the same time as the letters. This suffices for a complete keyboard but also yields an initial set-up menu that works like you think it should (draft6.cpp).&lt;p&gt;The last frontier is page flipping. We have eight pages, so we'll need more than just the single bit the original Micro Script twiddles. The VDG merely fetches the lower 12 bits of the address bus; the higher bits are set externally. Although our other memory mapped I/O locations neatly fell on large binary boundaries ($2000, $4000, $6000, $8000), a pleasingly simple addressing scheme, we don't see any other access at $a000, $c000 or $e000, so our paging register for what shows up onscreen must be either elsewhere or consolidated into one of the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of the disassembly shows that only $2000 is ever stored to; the others (our RAM at $8000 notwithstanding) appear to be read-only. But there is the matter of those upper three bits in $2000 which didn't change while in the menu, and three bits is just enough for eight pages of memory. Lo and behold, if we watchpoint $2000 with wpset 0x2000,1,w,(wpdata &amp;amp; 0xc0) != 0xc0 and press */ESC to jump into the first page, it changes to ... $20! And so does the value in $03. If we change our watchpoint to $03 this time, start cycling the screens and wait for any change to that register (wpclear and then wpset 0x03,1,w), we get the repeating sequence $20, $60, $a0, $e0, $00, $40, $80. Or, in binary,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% perl -e 'foreach(0xc0,0x20,0x60,0xa0,0xe0,0x00,0x40,0x80){print unpack("B3",pack("C", $_))."\n";}' 110 001 011 101 111 000 010 100&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a predictable binary pattern, but there are two things worth noting: the value is always an even multiple of 32, and no matter what that value is, the title editor still writes to $8000. (This is how we can see the page hasn't flipped, or at least not the one onscreen.) I suspect this is so that the general architecture could be more quickly adapted to any potential number of memory pages, say for a future "Super-Duper Micro Script" or something.&lt;/p&gt;There is also a bit of garbage that gets written to the first few bytes of $8000 at the same time when we enter the editor ... but carefully checking the timing in the MAME debugger shows these are written with $03/$2000 set to $c0. If we look carefully, we can see this on the real system too.&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that $8000 is just a window into RAM and this bitset determines what tract of memory is seen there (and thus the VDG just goes on fetching from the same place regardless of the current page too). However, if so, then one wonders what the actual page size is. Let's run with this theory, since we know we can execute code on the CPU now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;org $f000 ; init stack pointer, set page to default start sei clc lds #$7f ldaa #$00 staa $2000 ; wait for VDG wait1 ldaa $6000 anda #$40 beq wait1 wait2 ldaa $6000 anda #$40 bne wait2 ; clear screen to black ldx #$8000 ldaa #$80 ; black clrl staa 0,x inx cpx #$8200 bne clrl ; put different characters at $8000 $8100 $8200 $8300 ; and then read them back ldaa #$01 staa $8000 inca staa $8100 inca staa $8200 inca staa $8300 ldaa $8000 staa $8040 ldaa $8100 staa $8041 ldaa $8200 staa $8042 ldaa $8300 staa $8043 clc bcc * ds ($fffe-*) dw start&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This little program, when assembled (using the Macroassembler AS, which is what we will be using for all of our assembly code snippets in this article), then scrambled and uploaded to the ROM emulator, will clear the screen and put what should be an A at $8000, a B at $8100, a C at $8200 and a D at $8300. It then tries to read them back. We know the window must be at least 512 bytes long because the screen must be at least 512 bytes long (32x16), given that the VDG can't cope with anything smaller. If the memory window is a full 1K (or more), we should see ABCD. If the window is only 512 bytes and the 512 bytes are repeated in each half of the 1K zone, then we would see CDCD because the memory is mirrored and the subsequent writes to $8200 and $8300 obliterate $8000 and $8100. If the window is only 512 bytes and not mirrored, then we would see AB and then whatever reading open bus looks like.&lt;/p&gt;And it looks like a 512 byte window with mirroring. (By contrast, the original Micro Script kept both pages in memory at once at $2000 and $2200.) This is kind of a bummer because it means apart from the 6802's internal RAM, we can only access the main RAM in 512 byte pages and whatever page we choose ends up displayed on-screen whether we want it to or not — except perhaps during the vertical blank, which gives us an idea, so hold that thought.&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we can finish the basic components of the driver: we'll use the register at $2000 as an offset into the RAM pool, set up lambdas on that range so that the editor keeps on writing to $8000-$81ff and have our VDG read routine reference the same register so that it sees the right page as well. To speed this up a bit we'll cache the bank offset and the RAM pointer in our driver.&lt;/p&gt;This is a good time to explore memory further. For this I wrote up a primitive live monitor program I dubbed "SMSBUG" that is aware of the current "video bank" (page). Moving through the address space,&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;there is open bus from $0080 to $1fff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$2000 is mirrored through $3fff, and only ever reads $ff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$4000 is mirrored through $5fff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$6000 is mirrored through $7fff, but only bit 4 (the rest is open bus)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$8000-$81ff is mirrored in 512-byte windows through $9fff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$a000-$dfff is open bus&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$e000 is a mirror of $f000&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's try to program it like a home computer. There's not a lot of room in the 6802's built-in low memory and you have to share those 128 bytes besides with the stack and whatever the system ROM is using. Fortunately, because the wiring allows the CPU to push the VDG off the bus whenever it wants, it is absolutely possible to run machine code from the RAM sandwich. The problem with doing so is that the page your program occupies must be banked in, so unless you call "external code" (air quotes) to show some other page until the VDG enters the border and vertical blank (VBL), your code — which is probably not very nice looking — must be displayed. In this respect, programming the original Micro Script would have been easier because you could simply run your code from whatever page wasn't onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example of that kind of "external code" I wrote a few primitive helpers into SMSBUG to evaluate how practical writing machine code was; I didn't find it particularly so, but I left the primitives in there for you to try if you want. SMSBUG has a concept of the page you want to display — we'll call it the S-bank, for "screen bank" — and the page you want to execute from — we'll call it the U-bank, for "user bank." The U-bank is that hex digit in the screenshot before addresses, while the S-bank is in fact whatever is onscreen at that time. These primitive helpers, accessible from a jump table at $ff00 in the SMSBUG ROM, let you wait for the next VBL with the S-bank visible, scan or wait for a key, read or write a byte in the S-bank, fill memory in the S-bank, or specify an address in another page and jump to it as the new U-bank. The helpers handle banking your program out, doing the task, and banking it back in plus-minus waiting for the vertical blank again to keep the screen clean. This works about as well as can be expected, though you need to be constantly aware of your code's cycle count because overstaying the VBL (i.e., exceeding that ~440 cycle count) will make the display ugly quickly, and having to call at least one helper routine every screen refresh is a bit obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other home computers that exist with only a small amount of "real" RAM and keep the rest of it tied up in the video controller, which is effectively our present situation. The most (in)famous of these would probably be the Texas Instruments 99/4A, which in the unexpanded state has only the 256-byte scratchpad RAM directly accessible to the CPU, and its advertised 16K is entirely controlled by the 9918 VDP. It's possible to run tiny programs directly from scratchpad RAM, but that's about it. However, BASIC programs can be run from VDP memory because the TI ROM has an interpreter for a middle-level language called GPL, for Graphic Programming Language. This interpreter knows how to pull bytes in and out of VDP RAM, and TI BASIC is written in GPL, so it can use its facilities to (more slowly) access VDP RAM like regular RAM. We can do something similar. For simplicity we'll put together a tiny VM that happens to use bytecode the same as various 6800 instructions. It runs a subset of them and has its own A, B, P and X registers, plus some larger macro-operations for running small sections of native code and easier handling of the screen. By using this VM we can abstract away much of having to manage which page is displayed and which page is executing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how we actually write the programs, though, we'll need to be able to load those programs into it. And, with just a couple clips in the right places, we can do that too!&lt;/p&gt;The 74LS273 is an 8-channel ("octal") flip-flop. It energizes the five keypad columns, and because it's octal, it also appears that the three video banking bits go here too (i.e., this chip is what is decoded to $2000-$3fff). The 74LS244 next to it, a tri-state octal buffer driver, accepts the eight row outputs from the keypad ($4000). After some careful experiments with the multimeter, each of these outputs have pull-up resistors to +5V and ground their output when the button is pushed. Since we know we can completely de-energize the keypad, this is the ideal place to wire in, and all we need for a serial port is a single bit. We'll choose the input from row 0 (pin 2), which is wired to the low bit, and hook up one more test clip to anywhere we can get a ground level.&lt;p&gt;Borrowing some code from SMSBUG, as a proof of concept we'll now write a simple loop that will display the value received from the key rows when no column is selected (all column bits set to one). This should avoid any interference with the keypad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;org $f000 start sei clc lds #$7f loop ldaa #$df staa $2000 ldaa $4000 tab jsr hexnyh sta $8000 tba jsr hexny sta $8001 bra loop ; convert nybble in a to storable value ; 48-57 (0-9) and then 1-6 (a-f) hexnyh ; enter here if in high nybble rora rora rora rora hexny anda #15 ; enter here if in low nybble cmpa #10 bge hexnya adda #48 rts hexnya suba #9 rts ds ($fffe-*) dw start&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we're necessarily bitbanging — did I mention the Radio Shack MC-10? — we need to be precise about the timing, though in this system with no interrupts or NMIs that should be pretty easy to do. We already know our clock speed is the "standard" 3.58MHz (i.e., 315/88) internally divided by 4 (i.e., 315/352) to yield 894,886.3636... cycles per second. To sample and store each bit would be something like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ldaa $4000 rora ror 0,x&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;which rotates the low bit into carry, then rotates the carry into the current byte pointed to by the X register (recall that RS-232 transmits bits little-endian first). That's a total of 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 cycles per bit. For 57600bps at this clock speed we could take no more than 15.5 cycles per bit, so we could achieve it potentially by requiring an extra stop bit, but there's not a lot of room for error. 38.4kbps or 19.2kbps are more forgiving; we would need to be under 23.3 or 46.6 cycles per bit, though we're not transferring a lot of data, so let's go for the slower rate to give us plenty of margin. It's okay to be a little faster sampling bits as long as we're never slower, and we'll use the start bit (the transmission will be 8-N-1, i.e., 8 data bits, no parity and one stop bit) to resynchronize anyway.&lt;/p&gt;Of course, you always have to make sure you're sampling at the right point within each bit time. Each of these test bytes I sent should be advancing a single one bit (RS-232 is little endian). Pop quiz: can you see what I did wrong with my first attempt?&lt;p&gt;Pencils down. In each block of eight bits, I came off the start bit (always zero) too fast, so I got an extra zero at the beginning — and then an extra spurious character of all-ones because it saw the last zero as the start bit of another character followed by the line staying high. With that fixed, I can type (using control characters) a HELLO WORLD! ...&lt;/p&gt;... and see it onscreen!&lt;p&gt;Since we're not sending back any information to the transmitting side, we'll devise a simple format for encapsulating a page with a checksum. It will always be 514 bytes, padded with nulls, starting with a simple 16-bit big-endian short sum of the following 512 bytes of data (meaning the null padding won't invalidate the checksum). This is more than sufficient for a fast local transmission because it's not like we're using noisy copper POTS lines here. SMSBUG will then read that fixed 514 bytes, noting the checksum and storing the 512 bytes of data trailing it into the selected page, then verify the checksums match and display an error if they do not. I created a simple file of all byte values from 0-255, wrote a Perl script to pad, sum and tag it, and then sent it from the MacBook Air using picocom and ascii-xfr through the receive routine I wrote for SMSBUG.&lt;/p&gt;Success! — and also the entirety of the character set, for posterity. Let's add this support to our eighth and last revision for MAME, now the final draft in smicros.cpp. This requires specifying the serial port's speed and characteristics and the type of device it represents (in our case the closest equivalent is a simple null modem, not a full-blown terminal), then adjusting our keyboard read routine to check and incorporate the receive line from the virtual RS-232.&lt;p&gt;What we would like is to run that emulated null modem on a TCP socket and blast data at it with something like netcat. This can be done with MAME, but MAME nowadays expects to connect to an existing socket, like emulating a terminal to connect to some other listening process; it doesn't create a listening socket itself. Happily it's simple enough to create a receive-only pipe that MAME can connect to and that we can also push data to, which is all we need for our homebrew SMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate window somewhere (I'm doing this on macOS but it also works on Linux, *BSD and other Unixy things, and Windows folks can do something similar or identical in e.g. WSL), start up the pipe and leave it running for the duration of your session. Essentially we want to listen on two sockets at once but take data from one of the ports and feed it to the other, and two socats lashed together can do this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% socat -s -d0 tcp-listen:5555,bind=127.0.0.1,fork STDOUT | socat -s -d0 STDIN tcp-listen:4444,bind=127.0.0.1,fork&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The -s -d0 options make it more bulletproof and suppress warnings.) There is a shorter alternative with netcat:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;nc -lk 5555 | nc -lk 4444&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, note that as written this listens on all interfaces, not just localhost as the socat version does, which can be dangerous on a public network. Some versions or forks may let you change the listen address with -s 127.0.0.1. Either way, with this pipe running MAME will duly connect to the listener on port 4444, but programs we squirt into port 5555 will get passed over the shell pipe to the listener process on port 4444 and thus be transparently sent to MAME. This link isn't bidirectional, but we don't need it to be since our hacked SMS can't transmit anyway, so I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other consideration is that if you reset the emulator, you may lose the link because MAME closes the connection and opens a new socket which will be a different process. I found it simplest just to quit and restart MAME manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the MAME ROMs. Since most of you aren't going to have a real Super Micro Script, you can get the SMSBUG ROM from the Github project. Create a directory called smicros in your MAME ROMs folder, and then put smsbug.rom in it. To replace the font ROM with a less encumbered alternative, I added another ROM entry for the default 6847 font but with the unused characters blanked out as they are in the regular SMS font; this file is called 6847font.rom, is also in the Github project, and goes in the same directory. (If you do have real SMS ROMs, unscramble them using descramble and deframble, then rename the main ROM to smicros.rom and the font ROM to font.rom and place them in the same roms/smicros directory.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, build MAME. In the source tree under src/mame, create scriptovision/ and put smicros.cpp in it, then edit src/mame/mame.lst to include the following, keeping it in alphabetical order and making sure there are blank lines between it and the other stanzas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;@source:scriptovision/smicros.cpp smicros&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can either do a full build at this point or a single-driver build, which is what I use (on my M1 MacBook Air, I do make SUBTARGET=sms SOURCES=scriptovision/smicros.cpp REGENIE=1 -j8 which yields a binary called sms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we'll start the emulator. Here I'm using that single-driver build but the rest of the command line is the same if you compiled it into a full MAME binary. If you have no real SMS ROMs, use BIOS smsbugf for SMSBUG and the 6847 font ROM both on Github. Otherwise, you can also request BIOS factory for the factory ROMs, or smsbug for SMSBUG but using the factory SMS font ROM (my personal preference). The other options after selecting the BIOS set up a "bitbanger" serial port which connects to TCP port 4444 and internally routes the data it receives to the driver's emulated null modem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;./sms smicros -bios smsbugf -rs232 null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:4444&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, after you skip through the MAME info screens you'll be in SMSBUG on your very own emulated homebrew Super Micro Script, here using the 6847 internal font:&lt;/p&gt;By default you'll be in SMSBUG's memory monitor and U-bank 0 (the hex digit before each address). Page through memory with the up and down cursor keys; type slowly when interacting with the emulator, as the ROM is designed for a real SMS with the blister keypad, and those need a lot of debouncing. To look at different U-banks (this only matters when viewing the $8000-$9fff range), press U (a "U" will appear) and then press any even numbered hex digit. 0-9 are the numbers 0-9, but since these are doubled with A-J on the keypad, use K-P to generate A-F. You can jump to any address by typing a full four digits (press ESC, mapped to *, to cancel).&lt;p&gt;As a test of our network bitbanger, let's attempt to load one of the checksummed binaries. Press R ("receive") to accept a transmission to $8000 in the current U-bank and the screen will change to bright orange, indicating SMSBUG is ready for data. We'll choose my inexpertly rendered Canadian flag screen. In another terminal window,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;nc localhost 5555 &amp;lt; cflag.chk&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll see a flash of the flag and then, assuming you don't get a checksum ERROR, be returned to the SMSBUG monitor. Press TAB (mapped to PAGE) and you should see one sorry-looking maple leaf.&lt;/p&gt;De rien, Canada. The ESC/* key will return you to SMSBUG. But before we look at some other programs for our homebrew SMS, let's also get this working on our real Super Micro Script.&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have already placed the two serial clips on, next we need to burn this to a real ROM so I can use the ROM emulator for something else. The 2732 EPROM is a little bit of a problem child, though: some of the very common Xgecu programmers cannot generate the necessary voltage without modification, and it's just my luck to have one of those. Plus, UV-erasable EPROMs aren't nearly as convenient as flash anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution came, of all places, from the automotive tuning enthusiast community. It turns out 2732s were used a lot on various older engine control units and our gearhead friends have ways to replace them. C.A.T.S. sells a passive conversion board called the G2 EPROM Adapter for $35 at time of writing which takes a more typical SST27SF512 64K flash chip and reroutes the signals (not affiliated, just satisfied). You program the 27SF512, then plunk it in the adapter and install it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the generated file smsbug.rom, we repeat it 16 times to ensure that we get the same bundle of bits no matter how it gets programmed, and then flash the entire thing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% perl -e 'print "smsbug.rom " x 16' smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom % cat smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom &amp;gt; main512.rom % minipro -p SST27SF512@DIP28 -w main512.rom [...] Erasing... 0.21Sec OK Writing Code... 17.84Sec OK Reading Code... 1.10Sec OK Verification OK&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% minipro -p 2732A@DIP24 -r test.rom [...] Reading Code... 0.13Sec OK % md5sum smsbug.rom 53d5311edb14b992a137e445cb0fa884 smsbug.rom % md5sum test.rom 53d5311edb14b992a137e445cb0fa884 test.rom&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure it's aligned properly in the adapter for the check read; it will overhang the ZIF socket slightly because its pins are shifted back. (Hashes only current as of this writing, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;Out goes the probe and in goes the flash. I also put in a green clip for our serial wire instead of red since I decided I liked that colour better. Now SMSBUG is running independently on the real Super Micro Script as well. Programs are loaded into it the same way, using a TTL-to-USB serial dongle and any terminal program at 19.2kbps (e.g., picocom -b19200 /dev/path/to/your/serial/port --send-cmd="ascii-xfr -snv"). And to prove it's reproducible and reversible, I went ahead and did the same mod to my working issue 3, using a blue serial jumper so I can tell them apart without looking at the serial numbers. Yes, you too can make your own homebrew SMS with just two clips and a new ROM. Fired up and working and testing the genlock with this fun little composite test pattern generator that runs on an M5StickC-Plus2.&lt;p&gt;Let's explore the other demonstrations I put together. Along with cflag.chk you've also already seen charset.chk; that was our sample image of all 256 character glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;When creating the VM I didn't really have a systematic way of selecting which opcodes to support; I decided just to create a few simple programs and see what was efficient to do. Since we only have 4K of ROM to work with, I already knew it wasn't possible to emulate every single 6800 opcode, and some opcodes would have to be unique to or modified for the SMS (for example, I repurposed the otherwise useless WAI and RTI instructions as key-wait and return-to-SMSBUG opcodes). Opcodes "internal" to the emulated CPU or that don't require banking pages out are stacked back-to-back up to approximately the maximum number of cycles available in the vertical blank; otherwise, opcodes that modify the screen automatically force a VBL wait where appropriate.&lt;p&gt;A simple game is always a good first project, so I put together an SMS version of Paper-Scissors-Rock (Rock Paper Scissors, whatever). SMSBUG VM programs are primarily interpreted, but may contain small sections of native code which are copied into a 32-byte buffer in the low internal RAM of the 6802 and executed from there. While VM-based programs are still assembled with the Macroassembler AS, there is a include file that sets all the proper modes and provides macros for the emulated opcodes. Paper-Scissors-Rock primarily tests screen and character handling and the built-in random number generator (a simple PRNG based on Xorshift), with some of the decision logic written in native code blocks to make it more compact. Gameplay is self-explanatory. Load psr.chk with the (R)eceive key and then e(X)ecute it (with the X key). The eXecute option will automatically run the VM for addresses between $8000 and $8fff. The source code is in psr.a68.&lt;/p&gt;For comparison, here is the Hello World I created for testing native machine code (the source is mltest.a68). It's slower than it should be, mostly because it has to call into SMSBUG or create small low-memory routines to do anything with the S-bank, which also makes any aspiring demo screen effects a lot more complicated. Sure, you could create a whole bunch of support routines and call them to handle common tasks, but then you might as well just make those calls into opcodes for compactness, right? Receive mltest.chk, but instead of immediately eXecuting it, enter 9000 to move the monitor to $9000, and then eXecute. This memory range mirrors $8000, but SMSBUG treats anything outside of $8000-$8fff as native code instead of VM code, setting the U-bank before it jumps into it. Press any key to return to SMSBUG.&lt;p&gt;Wait, you still want to use it as a video titler too? Hey, we got yer back.&lt;/p&gt;For slides, I wrote up a simple slide show system that goes through the other pages and displays them, a la what the original SMS menu did. Receive slides.chk into U-bank 0 and your other screens into the next ones (remember, U changes the U-bank; R will load to whatever the current U-bank is). For this example, Receive cflag.chk into U-bank 2 and charset.chk into U-bank 4.&lt;p&gt;Now go back to U-bank 0 where the slides code is. Look at the bytes at $8003 and $8004 (as shown in the screenshot). This is the total number of screens (here two) and the number of VBLs to wait between screens (200, roughly 3 seconds or so). The default is fine for our two screens, but if you want to change them, enter the address (either 8003 or 8004) and then the S key (Set), and then type hex bytes which will be stored; press ESC/* when you're done. Either way, when ready, ensure you're in U-bank 0 at address $8000 and eXecute the program. The screens are shown from last to first and cycle in that order endlessly. Hold down ESC/* to exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of implementing the slideshow feature as a runnable VM program, besides saving space in ROM, is now you can have it do more than just flip pages: you could alter the code to animate screens, change colours, place text on them, you name it. The source code is in slides.a68. I should parenthetically note here that it isn't possible to Receive to U-bank E from the SMSBUG monitor because the monitor uses that page as its S-bank (so it gets overwritten immediately), which limits you to six slides (2, 4, 6, 8, A and C). However, page E is free for use once your program is executing.&lt;/p&gt;Horizontal scrolling, however, is one thing that the VM is not well-suited for, and even a native code scroller loaded into the RAM sandwich would have to do a lot of fancy footwork between pages. I decided this one I would implement in SMSBUG. As an example of the scroller in action, Receive scroll.chk into the current U-bank, than press T. A scroll appears on the bottom of the screen and repeats endlessly until you press ESC/*. Here I have it genlocked with the composite video generator.&lt;p&gt;The first byte in the U-bank ($8000) is the speed between characters, again measured in VBLs. Change this with the Set option. The scroll routine doesn't do multiple pages nor zoomed characters, but you can have multiple scroll texts in different U-banks and switch between them by changing the U-bank before starting the scroll. The scroller uses S-bank E like the SMSBUG monitor, permitting up to seven scroll strings in the other U-banks. The Perl script genscroll.pl takes a string of up to 446 ASCII characters on standard input and creates a checksum file, converting the characters to screen codes and padding it with black spaces on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally what passes for a demo, or at least an advertisement: a fully animated "store demo" for the homebrew Super Micro Script. This video is of a real SMS. It pushes the VM fairly close to its limits and there is some "snow" during scrolling because not all of the byte moves get done before the 6847 starts fetching again, but I still think it came out pretty good for a hack thrown together over a weekend. It uses the VM primitives for screen scrolling and filling to generate the colour bar effects, and string display for the informational text boxes. Receive ad.chk and eXecute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's finish the story of Scriptovision before we conclude.&lt;/p&gt;The Super Micro Script was succeeded in 1990 by the Micro Script IV, a radically different unit. Three fonts were included, with upper and lower case letters in sixteen sizes and seven colours with proportional spacing. The slideshow and scroll/crawl modes were now complemented by slide and cycle modes, up to 32 screens were supported, the genlock remained standard equipment, and it additionally provided an RS-232 port for input. It sold for $895 [about $2185 in 2026 dollars], plus $23 shipping. Inflation had hit the demo tape as well: it was now $15.&lt;p&gt;While it's not clear what the architecture was, we know this was a small business that used chips from off-the-shelf, and the presence of a PC keyboard suggests it may well have been ... an embedded x86 PC. Indeed, seven colours could be an EGA palette if they only used one brightness and didn't count black, but this is mere conjecture on my part. The Micro Script IV was succeeded by the Micro Script V in the mid-1990s, though I can't find any information on it, and it appears to be the last of the line. Scriptovision also developed a duplication system in 1997 called (surprise!) Duplicator, also with apparently no surviving documentation, and to date I've found no further record of any later products the company made. Nevertheless, it was not officially dissolved until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall I'm pretty happy with how this homebrew "Canadian home computer" came out, and we solved some mysteries about the hardware in the process. Scriptovision clearly didn't intend this machine to be used in this fashion and for 1985 it would not have been a cutting-edge general purpose computer by any means, but it was certainly comparable to other low-end machines and at the right price it might have found sufficient interest. Indeed, the built-in genlock would certainly have been a unique feature in a home system. I look forward to other people using this article to convert the next Super Micro Script they run across on eBay, or devise a simpler version for the Micro Script, and then start writing their own programs. The Great White North deserves no less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not done a pull request to the MAME team for the SMS MAME driver. I don't know if they'd be interested in a video titler (and a hacked one at that), nor have I closely audited what I wrote for adherence to their code policy. However, if you know this is something the MAME project would want, let me know in the comments or on Github.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the programs in this article, including the ROM scramblers and unscramblers, the SMSBUG source code, and the sample programs, along with full documentation of the SMSBUG VM opcodes and system calls, are in the Github project. They are provided to you under a BSD 3-clause license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to share some thoughts on my recent experience with OpenClaw. Over the past year, I’ve been actively using Claude Code for development. Many people believed AI could already assist with programming—seemingly replacing programmers—but I never felt it brought any revolutionary change to the way I work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, agentic coding tools like Claude Code and Cursor have made writing code easier, but at the end of the day, I was still the one writing. It might look like the AI is doing the work, but “writing” is a broad term—writing is execution. As the person making code happen, I’m the one writing code. Whether I’m editing line by line, copy-pasting, or telling an AI what I want and letting it finish—it’s still me “writing.” My role as the programmer responsible for turning code into reality hasn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My productivity did improve, but for any given task, I still had to jump into the project, set up the environment, open my editor and Claude Code terminal. I was still the operator; the only difference was that instead of typing code manually, I was typing intent into a chat box. That only changed one dimension. Testing, debugging—most of it still fell on me. There was some change, sure, but it wasn’t mature, and there was no fundamental shift. I still had to stay deeply involved and monitor everything. And it was exactly this deep involvement that kept me stuck in the role of code executor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then OpenClaw came along, and everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once discussed with my wife: in the age of AI, should you aim to be a “super individual” or build a “super team”? My answer is: become a “super manager.” A super individual who can juggle multiple threads and coordinate numerous AI tools is essentially demonstrating great management skills. Being a super individual means using AI tools to lift yourself from a basic executor to a higher-level one, and eventually into a manager. So even if you’re going the super individual route, you need solid management awareness and methods to keep everything running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw gave me the chance to become that super manager. After a few rounds of practice, I found that I could completely step away from the programming environment and handle an entire project’s development, testing, deployment, launch, and usage—all through chatting on my phone. That’s something Claude Code simply can’t do, or rather, it was never designed to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a general-purpose agent, OpenClaw interacts through messaging apps via voice, accurately understands what I mean, works independently for extended periods, and has solid memory—it can persist the methods and rules it picks up during work, gradually evolving through use. These are the capabilities that make it the real turning point for replacing me as the code executor. The biggest change is this: I just need to express my intent, and it automatically creates the project, writes up a plan for me to review. I can discuss changes with it by voice, and then it executes—even directing Claude Code to do the actual coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It replaced the “me” that used to write code, truly stepping into the programmer role and freeing me to act as a manager. A manager shouldn’t get bogged down in the specifics—they should focus on the higher-level, abstract work. That’s what management really is. You could even flip it around: you’re only a true manager when you can get things done purely through communication. Before, Claude Code alone couldn’t get you there. But when you have a dedicated machine running 24/7, set up with all your tools, and an agent that understands your intent sitting at the computer writing and debugging code for you—that’s when things truly change. That’s when the revolution arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the biggest shift OpenClaw has brought—it completely transformed my workflow. Whether it’s personal or commercial projects, I can step back and look at things from a management perspective. It’s like having a programmer who’s always on standby, ready to hop into meetings, discuss ideas, take on tasks, report back, and adjust course at any time. It can even juggle multiple roles, like having several programmers working on different projects simultaneously. Meanwhile, I can be the tech lead keeping tabs on specific project progress, or the project manager steering the overall schedule and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has truly freed up my productivity, letting me pursue so many ideas I couldn’t move forward on before. I feel like my life genuinely changed at this moment. I used to have way too many ideas but no way to build them all on my own—they just kept piling up. But now, everything is different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s like I suddenly have a team, achieving the dream scenario I always imagined: owning a company, hiring people to bring my ideas to life, while I just focus on product design and planning. I’m closer than ever to that dream state. Before, that required serious capital. Without money, you can’t hire anyone, and you can’t just be the idea person. Unless you’re some trust fund kid doing it for fun, you’re stuck bouncing between “indie developer who wants to build multiple projects” and “solo hustler just trying to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now, I can finally break out of that trap and move toward actually having a team. It keeps all my projects moving forward at any time. It’s not perfect yet, but I’ve taken the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you, OpenClaw. Thank you, AGI—for me, it’s already here. The gears of fate are turning in directions I never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Matchlock is a CLI tool for running AI agents in ephemeral microVMs - with network allowlisting, secret injection via MITM proxy, and everything else blocked by default. Your secrets never enter the VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents need to run code, but giving them unrestricted access to your machine is a risk. Matchlock lets you hand an agent a full Linux environment that boots in under a second - isolated, disposable, and locked down by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When your agent calls an API the real credentials are injected in-flight by the host. The sandbox only ever sees a placeholder. The network is sealed by default and nothing gets out unless you say so. Even if the agent is tricked into running something malicious your keys don't leak and there's nowhere for data to go. Inside the agent gets a full Linux environment to do whatever it needs. It can install packages and write files and make a mess. Outside your machine doesn't feel a thing. Every sandbox runs on its own copy-on-write filesystem that vanishes when you're done. Same CLI and same behaviour whether you're on a Linux server or a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original Game (1982) by Atari, Inc.&lt;lb/&gt; Original Designer: Howard Scott Warshaw&lt;lb/&gt; Disassembly &amp;amp; Analysis: Dennis Debro &amp;amp; Halkun (That's me!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repository contains the fully reverse-engineered and commented source code for the Atari 2600 classic, Raiders of the Lost Ark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project has been reorganized for a clean development workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt;: Contains the main assembly source (&lt;code&gt;raiders.asm&lt;/code&gt;) and header files (&lt;code&gt;tia_constants.h&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt;: Contains build tools (DASM) and emulator executable (Stella).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;out/&lt;/code&gt;: Destination for compiled binaries (&lt;code&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt;), symbol files (&lt;code&gt;.sym&lt;/code&gt;), and listing files (&lt;code&gt;.lst&lt;/code&gt;). (auto generated at compile time)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;make.bat&lt;/code&gt;: Windows batch script to compile the project.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;run.bat&lt;/code&gt;: Windows batch script to launch the compiled game.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows OS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DASM: &lt;code&gt;dasm.exe&lt;/code&gt;must be in the&lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt;folder.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stella: &lt;code&gt;Stella.exe&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;SDL2.dll&lt;/code&gt;must be in the&lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt;folder (optional, for running).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the build script from the root directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make.bat&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch the compiled ROM in Stella:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;run.bat&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game uses a 2-bank ROM (8KB total) with bank-switching via strobes at &lt;code&gt;BANK0STROBE&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$FFF8&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;BANK1STROBE&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$FFF9&lt;/code&gt;). Bank switching is done through a self-modifying code technique whare opcodes are written into zero-page RAM variables and executed in-place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bank 0 (&lt;code&gt;BANK0TOP&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;$D000&lt;/code&gt;): Contains game logic — collision handling, inventory management, room event handlers, scoring, movement, input processing, and sound.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bank 1 (&lt;code&gt;BANK1TOP&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;$F000&lt;/code&gt;): Contains the display kernels, sprite data, playfield graphics, room handler dispatch, and music frequency tables.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like all Atari 2600 games, the program is structured around the NTSC television signal — one complete pass through the loop produces one frame of video (~60 fps). The frame is divided into four phases: VSYNC, VBLANK, Kernel (visible picture), and Overscan. Game logic is split across VBLANK and Overscan to stay within the CPU time budgets of each phase, and the two ROM banks are switched in and out at specific points every frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entry point: &lt;code&gt;startNewFrame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU asserts the VSYNC signal for exactly 3 scanlines, during which it performs lightweight housekeeping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Scanline&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Work&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Assert VSYNC. Clamp weapon position — if &lt;code&gt;weaponPosY&lt;/code&gt; ≤ &lt;code&gt;$50&lt;/code&gt;, center &lt;code&gt;weaponPosX&lt;/code&gt;. Increment &lt;code&gt;frameCount&lt;/code&gt;; every 64th frame (&lt;code&gt;and #$3f&lt;/code&gt;) increments &lt;code&gt;timeOfDay&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;eventTimer&lt;/code&gt; is negative, decrement it (paralysis/cutscene countdown).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Check for game restart — if &lt;code&gt;arkRoomStateFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set (endgame state) AND the RESET switch is pressed, jump to &lt;code&gt;startGame&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;De-assert VSYNC. Arm the VBLANK timer: &lt;code&gt;TIM64T = VBLANK_TIME&lt;/code&gt; (44). This gives 44 × 64 = 2,816 cycles ≈ 37 scanlines of CPU time for game logic.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All game logic runs while the TIA outputs a blank screen. Work is spread across both ROM banks with two bank switches during this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the largest block of game code, executing in order every frame:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Label&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;frameFirstLine&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Game-over check: if &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; overflows to 0, call &lt;code&gt;getFinalScore&lt;/code&gt; and transition to the Ark Room.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkShowDevInitials&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ark Room / title screen: if in the Ark Room, play Raiders March, check Yar bonus for HSW initials easter egg. Otherwise skip.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(Ark Room only)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Pedestal elevator: slowly lower Indy to his score height. Check fire button for restart. Set &lt;code&gt;arkRoomStateFlag&lt;/code&gt; to enable RESET.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;HandleEasterEgg&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cutscene check: if &lt;code&gt;screenEventState&lt;/code&gt; bit 6 is set, advance the Arkbreveal sequence.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;advanceArkSeq&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Snake AI: every 4th frame, grow snake sprite, steer toward Indy using &lt;code&gt;snakePosXOffsetTable&lt;/code&gt;, update &lt;code&gt;ballPosX&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ballPosY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernelRenderState&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;configSnake&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Snake kernel setup: load &lt;code&gt;kernelDataPtrLo/Hi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernelDataIndex&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;snakeMotionTable&lt;/code&gt; for the wiggling ball sprite.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkMajorEventDone&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set (death in progress), skip to &lt;code&gt;finishedScrollUpdate&lt;/code&gt; — bypass normal input.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkGameScriptTimer&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If &lt;code&gt;eventTimer&lt;/code&gt; is negative (Indy paralyzed/frozen), force standing sprite and skip input.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;branchOnFrameParity&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Frame parity split: even frames run full input processing. Odd frames skip to &lt;code&gt;clearItemUseOnButtonRelease&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;gatePlayerTriggeredEvent&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Weapon aiming: joystick moves the weapon crosshair (missile 1) with boundary clamping.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;handleIndyMove&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Movement: read &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;getMoveDir&lt;/code&gt; → move Indy → check room boundary override tables (&lt;code&gt;CheckRoomOverrideCondition&lt;/code&gt;) → trigger room transitions if a boundary is crossed.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;HandleIInventorySelect&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Left controller: fire button cycles through inventory slots. Handles item drop, bullet reload (+3), and shovel placement.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clearItemUseOnButtonRelease&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Clears &lt;code&gt;USING_GRENADE_OR_PARACHUTE&lt;/code&gt; flag on right fire button release.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;handleItemUse&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Right controller: fire button dispatches the selected item — grenade throw/cook timer, parachute deploy, grapple hook launch, shovel dig, Ankh warp, revolver fire, whip strike. This is the largest single block in VBLANK.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;updateIndyParachuteSprite&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sprite selection: choose Indy's current sprite pointer — parachute sprite, standing sprite, or walk-cycle animation (advances frame on a timer).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;handleMesaScroll&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Vertical scrolling: in Mesa Field or Valley of Poison, shift the camera offset (&lt;code&gt;roomObjectVar&lt;/code&gt;) and adjust all object Y positions to scroll the world.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At &lt;code&gt;finishedScrollUpdate&lt;/code&gt;, the code writes &lt;code&gt;selectRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt; as the target address and jumps through the &lt;code&gt;jumpToBank1&lt;/code&gt; trampoline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;selectRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt; dispatches via &lt;code&gt;roomHandlerJmpTable&lt;/code&gt; — each room has its own handler that runs room-specific AI and physics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Sets mesa landing bonus, then shares thief-movement code&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All handlers exit via &lt;code&gt;jmpSetupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt;, which bank-switches back to Bank 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;setupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt; prepares the TIA for display:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;screenInitFlag&lt;/code&gt;≠ 0, call&lt;code&gt;updateRoomEventState&lt;/code&gt;(one-shot room initialization), then clear the flag.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;NUSIZ0&lt;/code&gt;from the per-room&lt;code&gt;HMOVETable&lt;/code&gt;entry.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;CTRLPF&lt;/code&gt;from&lt;code&gt;roomPFControlFlags&lt;/code&gt;(playfield reflection/priority/ball size).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;COLUBK&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLUPF&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLUP0&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLUP1&lt;/code&gt;from per-room color tables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If in the Thieves' Den or Well of Souls, initialize 5 thief HMOVE positions from table data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then &lt;code&gt;setObjPosX&lt;/code&gt; positions all 5 TIA objects (P0, P1, M0, M1, Ball) using the coarse/fine HMOVE technique. This consumes 6 scanlines (one WSYNC per object + one for HMOVE).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;waitTime&lt;/code&gt; spins on &lt;code&gt;INTIM&lt;/code&gt; until the VBLANK timer expires, then bank-switches to Bank 1 for &lt;code&gt;drawScreen&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entry point: &lt;code&gt;drawScreen&lt;/code&gt; (Bank 1)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first few visible lines set up the display state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear horizontal motion registers (&lt;code&gt;HMCLR&lt;/code&gt;) and collision latches (&lt;code&gt;CXCLR&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write initial PF0/PF1/PF2 from per-room playfield tables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable TIA output (&lt;code&gt;VBLANK = 0&lt;/code&gt;), zero the&lt;code&gt;scanline&lt;/code&gt;counter.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disable the Ball sprite in the Map Room (used for the sun position mechanic).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt;→ set&lt;code&gt;REFP1&lt;/code&gt;for Indy sprite reflection (skipped during death/Ark Room).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Three WSYNC+HMOVE pairs to settle object positions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dispatch to the appropriate kernel via RTS-trick: push return address from &lt;code&gt;kernelJumpTable&lt;/code&gt;indexed by&lt;code&gt;KernelJumpTableIndex&lt;/code&gt;for the current room, then&lt;code&gt;rts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel index table maps each room to one of four kernels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Kernel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Rooms&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Scanline Method&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0–5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2 scanlines/iteration, 80 iterations&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6–10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2 scanlines/iteration, 80 iterations&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11–12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;State machine, variable per thief zone&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1 scanline/iteration, ~160 lines&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Treasure Room, Marketplace, Entrance, Black Market, Map Room, Mesa Side):
Two scanlines per loop. Scanline 1: HMOVE, check snake/ball draw range, enable missiles M0 (web/swarm) and M1 (weapon) by comparing against their Y positions. Scanline 2: draw P0 sprite — bit 7 of the graphics data encodes inline TIA register writes (color/HMOVE) instead of shape data, allowing P0 to change color or position mid-frame. Enable the ball by scanline comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Temple Entrance, Spider Room, Shining Light, Mesa Field, Valley of Poison):
Two scanlines per loop with playfield scrolling. On each iteration, the scanline is compared to &lt;code&gt;p0DrawStartLine&lt;/code&gt; — above that boundary, the kernel indexes &lt;code&gt;(pf1GfxPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;(pf2GfxPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; with a scroll offset (&lt;code&gt;roomObjectVar&lt;/code&gt;) to render the scrolling wall. Below that boundary, &lt;code&gt;dynamicGfxData&lt;/code&gt; renders destructible dungeon wall segments or cleared passages. Both paths draw P0 and P1 (Indy) by scanline–vs–Y comparison. The ball object is driven through &lt;code&gt;(kernelDataPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; for the snake wiggle animation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Thieves' Den, Well of Souls):
Displays 5 enemy thieves using a single P0 hardware sprite, repositioned between each thief's zone (~32 scanlines each). Operates as a state machine via &lt;code&gt;kernelRenderState&lt;/code&gt;: positioning phase (bit 7) uses a coarse/fine delay loop to place RESP0, drawing phase (bit 6) streams &lt;code&gt;(p0GfxPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(kernelDataPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; for sprite and color data across 16 lines. Between thief zones, P1 (Indy) is drawn using the PHP/stack trick — &lt;code&gt;txs&lt;/code&gt; redirects the stack pointer so that &lt;code&gt;php&lt;/code&gt; writes directly to TIA enable registers (&lt;code&gt;ENABL&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ENAM1&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ENAM0&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;$1F&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;$1E&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;$1D&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Ark Room — title and ending screen):
Single-height scanlines (1 WSYNC per line). Lines 0–14: draw the Ark top/wings sprite with rainbow color cycling (only in win state). Lines 15–28: draw the Ark body with alternating gold patterns. Lines 29–143: draw Indy's standing sprite at the pedestal height determined by &lt;code&gt;adventurePoints&lt;/code&gt; — above Indy is empty, below is the diamond-pattern &lt;code&gt;PedestalLiftSprite&lt;/code&gt;. Lines 144–159: draw the pedestal base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All four room kernels converge at &lt;code&gt;drawInventoryKernel&lt;/code&gt;, which draws the bottom-of-screen inventory strip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 lines: Clear all sprites, fill PF1/PF2 solid (separator bar).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 lines: Set &lt;code&gt;NUSIZ0&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;NUSIZ1&lt;/code&gt;to 3-copies-close mode, enable VDEL for both players, position P0/P1 for 48-pixel-wide multiplexed rendering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 line: HMOVE to fine-position, set inventory item colors (gold), position ball (selection cursor).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 line: Clear playfield, set &lt;code&gt;COLUBK&lt;/code&gt;to black.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5 lines: Burgundy background border.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8 lines: &lt;code&gt;drawInventoryItems&lt;/code&gt;— render 6 inventory item sprites using the 48-pixel GRP0/GRP1 VDEL technique (write P0, P1, P0, P1, P0, P1 in rapid succession each line).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4 lines: Clear sprites, reset VDEL/NUSIZ, draw selection cursor ball.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4 lines: Final separator lines and overscan preparation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately after the inventory kernel, the TIA is blanked (&lt;code&gt;VBLANK = $0F&lt;/code&gt;) and the overscan timer is armed: &lt;code&gt;TIM64T = OVERSCAN_TIME&lt;/code&gt; (36). This gives 36 × 64 = 2,304 cycles ≈ 30 scanlines. The stack pointer is also reset to &lt;code&gt;$FF&lt;/code&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Label&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;updateSoundRegisters&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Process both TIA audio channels (X=1, then X=0). Set AUDC, AUDV, AUDF. Dispatch to &lt;code&gt;playRaidersMarch&lt;/code&gt; (effect &lt;code&gt;$9C&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;playFluteMelody&lt;/code&gt; (effect &lt;code&gt;$84&lt;/code&gt;) for sustained music playback.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;finishUpdateSound&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If holding the Timepiece: toggle open/closed sprite on right fire press. If holding the Flute: activate Snake Charmer song.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;updateEventState&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If &lt;code&gt;screenEventState&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set: animate the on-screen event (move object toward target via &lt;code&gt;updateMoveToTarget&lt;/code&gt;), update timepiece graphics pointer for the snake reveal animation.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;UpdateInvItemPos&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Position 3 inventory display objects (X=2,3,4) via &lt;code&gt;UpdateInvObjPos&lt;/code&gt; — converts item slot sprite pointers into on-screen X positions.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(death check)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Death dissolve sequence: if &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set, shrink &lt;code&gt;indySpriteHeight&lt;/code&gt; by 1 line every 16 frames with a descending sound effect. At height &amp;lt; 3 (hat only), rotate the flag and pause for 60 frames. At frame 120: respawn with full height, decrement &lt;code&gt;livesLeft&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;livesLeft&lt;/code&gt; goes negative, set &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag = $FF&lt;/code&gt; (triggers game-over on the next frame's overflow check).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;invItemSelectCycle&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If not in the Ark Room: read &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt; left/right to cycle inventory selection. Handle hourglass → grapple initialization in Mesa Field. Drive the grapple state machine (incrementing stages, position alignment checks).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At &lt;code&gt;jmpObjHitHandeler&lt;/code&gt;, the code bank-switches to Bank 0 and enters the collision dispatch chain. This reads the TIA collision registers that were latched during the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXM1P&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Weapon (M1) hit player/thief → flip thief direction, clear weapon, apply &lt;code&gt;thiefShotPenalty&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

          &lt;code&gt;CXM1FB&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Weapon hit playfield → destroy dungeon wall segment (modify &lt;code&gt;dynamicGfxData&lt;/code&gt; bitmask).&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkMesaSideExit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXM0P&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Mesa Side: M0 collision enters Well of Souls; falling off (Indy Y ≥ &lt;code&gt;$4F&lt;/code&gt;) enters Valley of Poison.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkPlayerCollision&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXPPMM&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Player-player collision → dispatches to room-specific handlers via &lt;code&gt;playerHitJumpTable&lt;/code&gt; for pickups and interactions (whip, key, baskets, shovel, parachute landing, etc.).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;playerHitDefault&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXP1FB&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Secondary dispatch → &lt;code&gt;playfieldHitJumpTable&lt;/code&gt; for wall/boundary collisions and idle room logic.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkMissile0Hit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXM0P&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;M0-player collisions (spider web capture, tsetse swarm death), grenade detonation timer check.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the collision chain completes, execution falls through to &lt;code&gt;newFrame&lt;/code&gt;, which spins on &lt;code&gt;INTIM&lt;/code&gt; waiting for the overscan timer to expire — and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both banks contain a symmetric trampoline routine (&lt;code&gt;jumpToBank1&lt;/code&gt; in Bank 0, &lt;code&gt;JumpToBank0&lt;/code&gt; in Bank 1). The trampoline writes self-modifying code into zero-page RAM (&lt;code&gt;temp0&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;temp5&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;temp0: LDA $FFF8/$FFF9    ; reading the strobe address switches banks
temp3: JMP &amp;lt;target&amp;gt;        ; then jumps to the target address
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The caller sets &lt;code&gt;temp4&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;temp5&lt;/code&gt; to the target address before jumping to the trampoline. Executing &lt;code&gt;jmp temp0&lt;/code&gt; reads the bank strobe (switching ROM) and immediately jumps to the target label in the new bank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bank switches per frame (in execution order):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Direction&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Trigger&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Target&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 0 → 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;finishedScrollUpdate&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;selectRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt; (room-specific handler)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 1 → 0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;jmpSetupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;setupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt; (pre-kernel color/position setup)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 0 → 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;jmpDisplayKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;drawScreen&lt;/code&gt; (visible kernel + overscan)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 1 → 0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;jmpObjHitHandeler&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;checkWeaponPlayerHit&lt;/code&gt; (collision dispatch)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bank 1 also has a safety stub (&lt;code&gt;BANK1Start&lt;/code&gt;) at its reset vector entry — it immediately reads &lt;code&gt;BANK0STROBE&lt;/code&gt; to switch back to Bank 0 if Bank 1 is entered on power-on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Title / Ark Room: The Ark Room (&lt;code&gt;ID_ARK_ROOM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$0D&lt;/code&gt;) serves double duty as the title screen and the endgame screen. On cold boot, &lt;code&gt;startGame&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;currentRoomId = ID_ARK_ROOM&lt;/code&gt; and fills inventory with copyright text sprites. The VBLANK Ark Room logic plays the Raiders March, runs the pedestal elevator animation (lowering Indy to his score height), and checks the fire button for restart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death Sequence: Setting &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 triggers the death dissolve during overscan. Indy's sprite height shrinks by one line every 16 frames. Once only the hat remains (height &amp;lt; 3), the flag is rotated and the sprite disappears for 60 frames. At frame 120, Indy respawns at full height and &lt;code&gt;livesLeft&lt;/code&gt; is decremented. If lives drop below zero, &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;$FF&lt;/code&gt; — on the next frame, the VBLANK overflow check catches this and transitions to the Ark Room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Room Transitions: Triggered by the boundary override system in &lt;code&gt;handleIndyMove&lt;/code&gt;. When Indy crosses a room edge (checked via &lt;code&gt;CheckRoomOverrideCondition&lt;/code&gt; against per-room boundary tables), &lt;code&gt;currentRoomId&lt;/code&gt; is changed and &lt;code&gt;initRoomState&lt;/code&gt; reinitializes all per-room state — sprites, playfield pointers, object positions, and event flags. Special transitions include: Mesa Side fall into Valley of Poison (Y position check), M0 collision into Well of Souls, blown-open wall alignment into the Temple, and Ankh warp directly to Mesa Field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game uses 4 different scanline kernels selected via &lt;code&gt;KernelJumpTableIndex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernelJumpTable&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Kernel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Rooms&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Treasure Room, Marketplace, Entrance Room, Black Market, Map Room, Mesa Side&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Temple Entrance, Spider Room, Shining Light, Mesa Field, Valley of Poison&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt; (thiefKernel)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Thieves' Den, Well of Souls&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ark Room (title/ending)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each kernel handles TIA register writes differently to accommodate the visual needs of those rooms — the thief kernel manages multiple P0 objects across scanlines, while the playfield kernel handles scrolling dungeon walls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;: P0's data stream is dual-purpose — bit 7 encodes direct TIA register writes (color/HMOVE) instead of graphics. Simplest kernel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt;: Full PF1/PF2 rendering from pointer tables, dynamic dungeon wall segments, conventional P0/P1 drawing, ball object for timepiece. Supports scrollable rooms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;: P0 is repositioned and redrawn multiple times per frame via coarse timing loops — classic scanline multiplexing to display several enemies from one hardware sprite.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt;: Single-purpose kernel for the title/ending screen — draws the Ark sprite and Indy on a height-adjustable pedestal.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 14 rooms defined as constants (IDs &lt;code&gt;$00&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;$0D&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;ID&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Constant&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ID_TREASURE_ROOM&lt;/code&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ID_WELL_OF_SOULS&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Well of Souls&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;$0D&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ID_ARK_ROOM&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ark Room (Title/End)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Room transitions call &lt;code&gt;initRoomState&lt;/code&gt; which loads per-room data from tables: &lt;code&gt;roomBGColorTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;roomPFColorTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PFControlTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;objectPosXTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;roomObjPosYTable&lt;/code&gt;, playfield graphics pointers, and sprite data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each room has a handler dispatched from &lt;code&gt;roomHandlerJmpTable&lt;/code&gt; (Bank 1), which runs room-specific logic every frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The player can carry up to 6 items (&lt;code&gt;MAX_INVENTORY_ITEMS&lt;/code&gt;). Each slot is a pair of zero-page pointers (&lt;code&gt;invSlotLo&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;invSlotHi&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;invSlotLo6&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;invSlotHi6&lt;/code&gt;) that point directly to 8-byte sprite data in the &lt;code&gt;inventorySprites&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Item IDs are computed at assembly time as offsets from the sprite table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ID = (spriteLabel - inventorySprites) / HEIGHT_ITEM_SPRITES
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key items and their IDs include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Item&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ID_INVENTORY_EMPTY&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Shovel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ID_INVENTORY_SHOVEL&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selection uses the left joystick. &lt;code&gt;selectedItemSlot&lt;/code&gt; tracks the cursor position (byte offset 0,2,4,6,8,10 into the slot array), and &lt;code&gt;selectedInventoryId&lt;/code&gt; holds the current item's ID. Items are added via &lt;code&gt;placeItemInInventory&lt;/code&gt; and removed via &lt;code&gt;removeItem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Item Tracking Bitmasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game tracks which items have been collected using two separate bitmasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;basketItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;— Tracks spawnable items found at fixed world locations. In the Marketplace, these are the three literal baskets that contain the Key, Grenades, and Revolver. In the Treasure Room, the term "basket" is a code abstraction — it simply means the item is in its original, non-picked-up state (P0 displays the cycling item, and touching it picks it up). These items can respawn when dropped.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pickupItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;— Tracks unique items that exist as one-of-a-kind objects in the world: Whip, Shovel, Head of Ra, Timepiece, Hourglass, Ankh, and Chai. Once collected, their world placement changes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;itemIndexTable&lt;/code&gt; determines which bitmask applies to each item: even indices use &lt;code&gt;basketItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;, odd indices use &lt;code&gt;pickupItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;. The helper routines &lt;code&gt;showItemAsTaken&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setItemAsNotTaken&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;isItemAlreadyTaken&lt;/code&gt; handle the bit manipulation transparently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The score (&lt;code&gt;adventurePoints&lt;/code&gt;) starts at &lt;code&gt;INIT_SCORE&lt;/code&gt; (100) and is modified in &lt;code&gt;getFinalScore&lt;/code&gt;. Lower is better — bonuses are subtracted and penalties are added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonuses (subtracted):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Shot the thief&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final value determines Indy's pedestal height in the Ark Room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implemented in &lt;code&gt;playerHitInWellOfSouls&lt;/code&gt;. All three conditions must be true:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;indyPosY &amp;gt;= $3F&lt;/code&gt;— Indy is deep enough in the Well&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;diggingState == $54&lt;/code&gt;— dirt fully cleared via shovel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;secretArkMesaID == activeMesaID&lt;/code&gt;— correct mesa (discovered via Map Room)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When all three are met, &lt;code&gt;arkRoomStateFlag&lt;/code&gt; is set positive, triggering the endgame sequence in &lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt; which shows the Ark above Indy's pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calculated in &lt;code&gt;calculateMesaGrapple&lt;/code&gt; — converts the hook's pixel position to a grid ID:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RegionY = ((HookY - 6) + ScrollOffset) / 16
RegionX = (HookX - 16) / 32
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;mapRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt;, when Indy holds the Head of Ra and the sun (driven by &lt;code&gt;timeOfDay&lt;/code&gt;) is at the correct position, a beam reveals the Ark's mesa using data from &lt;code&gt;mapRoomArkLocX&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;mapRoomArkLocY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;timeOfDay&lt;/code&gt; increments every ~63 frames (roughly once per second), driven in the VBLANK section. It controls the timepiece display, treasure room rotation, sun position, and Head of Ra timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handled in &lt;code&gt;handleMesaScroll&lt;/code&gt; — the camera offset &lt;code&gt;roomObjectVar&lt;/code&gt; shifts all object positions when Indy nears screen edges, bounded by &lt;code&gt;MESA_MAP_MAX_HEIGHT&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$50&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two channels with effect timers (&lt;code&gt;soundChan0Effect&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;soundChan1Effect&lt;/code&gt;). The Raiders March plays from &lt;code&gt;raidersMarchFreqTable&lt;/code&gt; when triggered with &lt;code&gt;RAIDERS_MARCH&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$9C&lt;/code&gt;). The flute melody uses &lt;code&gt;snakeCharmFreqTable&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;SNAKE_CHARM_SONG&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$84&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Triggered via &lt;code&gt;HandleEasterEgg&lt;/code&gt; — finding Yar on the Flying Saucer Mesa sets &lt;code&gt;yarFoundBonus&lt;/code&gt;. When combined with a high enough score, Howard Scott Warshaw's initials (&lt;code&gt;devInitialsGfx0&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;devInitialsGfx1&lt;/code&gt;) appear in the inventory strip at &lt;code&gt;checkShowDevInitials&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Right joystick: Movement + action button (use items/weapons)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Left joystick: Inventory selection + drop button&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input is read from &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;$0280&lt;/code&gt;) and&lt;code&gt;INPT5&lt;/code&gt;(fire buttons)&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Curating a Show on My Ineffable Mother, Ursula K. Le Guin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would never have proposed this exhibition in her lifetime. This is, after all, a writer who said in an interview, “Don’t shove me into your damn pigeonhole, where I don’t fit, because I’m all over.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PORTLAND — Under an acrylic case in an exhibition I curated about my mother, the writer Ursula K. Le Guin (1929–2018), sits the first typewriter she purchased. Compact and impossibly heavy, the machine comes from an era of word production so distant as to feel alien. The keyboard has no exclamation point. To create the favorite punctuation of tyrants and optimists, one must type an apostrophe, then backspace and type a period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Underwood waited in my parents’ attic for decades as Ursula and the world moved on to electronic typewriters and eventually to computers. I hoped visitors to A Larger Reality, at Oregon Contemporary through February 8, could experience a little of the residual magic that I find clings to it, pecking out whatever they please, taking home the original and leaving a carbon copy for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m happiest when the case is removed and the gallery is filled with the sound of metal meeting paper. Visitors who’ve never used a manual typewriter, or who don’t touch type, peck tentatively. Others engage physically, producing the familiar percussive clack-clack sound of my childhood. Either way, I feel I’m sharing not just a machine but a sacred trust with strangers who love my mother’s writing and words in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People type poetry, memoir, fiction, epistles, articles, political statements, and fan mail on the Underwood. Some offer short tributes to Ursula or variations on “I can’t believe I’m typing on Ursula K. Le Guin’s typewriter.” Others compose prose or poetry on the spot. A few write nothing, go home to draft several pages, and return later to type something polished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One visitor’s letter wondered how Ursula would feel knowing that her writing and cultural presence are no longer her own after death. The question is apt for me as curator and literary executor. Even a very private writer, while she is alive, exercises a restraining influence on people’s ability to misinterpret her words or life story. I can take comfort in my mother’s respect for the agency and necessity of readers in creating literature. For many years, her stock fan mail reply was a thank-you note, in her handwriting, acknowledging that “a book is just a box of words until a reader opens it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I’ve experienced cycles of grief and joy as I pored over my mother’s letters, manuscripts, and drawings to exhibit. I listened to hours of her voice, recreated an oak tree from her childhood and the room she wrote in from my childhood home. Curating an exhibition about your parent is a strange experience. Many visitors intuit this; the most common question I’m asked about the exhibition is what my mother would think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I have no idea. I’ve learned not to second-guess my decisions by constantly asking myself, “What would Ursula do?” I would never have proposed this exhibition in her lifetime, for fear that she might see it as reductionist. This is, after all, a writer who said in an interview, “Don’t shove me into your damn pigeonhole, where I don’t fit, because I’m all over. My tentacles are coming out of the pigeonhole in all directions.” Biographical and retrospective exhibitions exist in large part to assert and codify who an artist is. That is, at some level, a type of pigeon-holing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This icon-production takes various forms, from hagiography to “objective” centrism to critique. True, if anyone is going to codify my mother, I prefer it to be me. I’m granted an advantage due to proximity and memory. But my version of Ursula is just one version. Even her version of herself was not authoritative. My mother remade herself, through her art, constantly and over decades. She revised everything from her early centering of male characters, to her use of he/him as the default pronoun in an imagined ambisexual world, to her critique of a Kazuo Ishiguro novel. Rather than worship an immutable icon, we should aspire to her willingness to learn and change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a technical, curatorial perspective, however, the mandate of narrative was my greatest hindrance. We’ve had it drummed into us that humans learn through stories, so anyone in an educative role must tell a story. For biographical exhibitions, however, linearity flattens the subject and condescends to the audience. I would go so far as to say this may be true for linearity imposed on any kind of exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother had something useful to say on this subject. Her essay The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction (1986), long a touchstone for writers, has recently become one for curators as well. Ursula posits, to simplify, that the reduction of narrative to linear, techno-heroic stories of conflict and conquest doesn’t serve us well. The hero’s journey remains a default model for storytelling in our culture, including for exhibitions. Ursula argues that the carrier bag, a humble yet capacious tool for gathering, is a better model for storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exhibitions can be superb carrier bags for culture and knowledge. Few experiences offer so many chances for discursion and recursion, negative space and introspection. A carrier bag can expand to make room for the needs of the moment, for participation, spectacle, and immersion. In a carrier bag, none of these qualities, in balance, is antithetical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For my part, releasing myself from the need to tell a tidy story about my mother led to an exhibition that is wordy, baggy, and inconclusive — but also, I believe, engaging and true to the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;(AI) Slop Terrifies Me&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🦔 🦔 🦔&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if this is as good as software is ever going to be? What if AI stops getting better and what if people stop caring?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if this is as good as AI gets. If this is where it stops, you'd still have models that can almost code a web browser, almost code a compiler—and can even present a pretty cool demo if allowed to take a few shortcuts. You'd still get models that can kinda-sorta simulate worlds and write kinda-sorta engaging stories. You'd still get self-driving cars that almost work, except when they don't. You get AI that can make you like 90% of a thing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;90% is a lot. Will you care about the last 10%?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm terrified that you won't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm terrified of the good enough to ship—and I'm terrified of nobody else caring. I'm less afraid of AI agents writing apps that they will never experience than I am of the AI herders who won't care enough to actually learn what they ship. And I sure as hell am afraid of the people who will experience the slop and will be fine with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a woodworking enthusiast I am slowly making my peace with standing in the middle of an IKEA. But at the rate things are going in this dropshipping hell, IKEA would be the dream. Software temufication stings much more than software commoditization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Claude and friends can help with crafting good software and with learning new technologies and programming languages—though I sure as hell move slower when I stop to learn and understand than the guy playing Dwarf Fortress with 17 agents. But at the same time AI models seem to constantly nudge towards that same median Next-React-Tailwind, good enough app. These things just don't handle going off the beaten path well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mind you, it's not like slop is anything new. A lot of human decisions had to happen before your backside ended up in an extremely uncomfortable chair, your search results got polluted by poorly-written SEO-optimized articles, and your brain had to deal with a ticket booking website with a user interface so poorly designed that it made you cry. So it's a people problem. Incentives just don't seem to align to make good software. Move fast and break things, etc, etc. You'll make a little artisan app, and if it's any good, Google will come along with a free clone, kill you, then kill its clone—and the world will be left with net zero new good software. And now, with AI agents, it gets even worse as agent herders can do the same thing much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers aside, there's also the users. AI models can't be imaginative, and the developers can't afford to, but surely with AI tools, the gap between users and developers will be bridged, ChatGPT will become the new HyperCard and people will turn their ideas into reality with just a few sentences? There's so many people out there who are coding without knowing it, from Carol in Accounting making insane Excel spreadsheets to all the kids on TikTok automating their phones with Apple Shortcuts and hacking up cool Notion notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if those people are an aberration? What if this state of tech learned helplessness cannot be fixed? What if people really do just want a glorified little TV in their pocket? What if most people truly just don't care about tech problems, about privacy, about Liquid Glass, about Microsoft's upsells, about constantly dealing with apps and features which just don't work? What if there will be nobody left to carry the torch? What if the future of computing belongs not to artisan developers or Carol from Accounting, but to whoever can churn out the most software out the fastest? What if good enough really is good enough for most people?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm terrified that our craft will die, and nobody will even care to mourn it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you use an Apple silicon Mac I’m sure you have been impressed by its performance. Whether you’re working with images, audio, video or building software, we’ve enjoyed a new turn of speed since the M1 on day 1. While most attribute this to their Performance cores, as it goes with the name, much is in truth the result of the unsung Efficiency cores, and how they keep background tasks where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see what I mean, start your Apple silicon Mac up from the cold, and open Activity Monitor in its CPU view, with its CPU History window open as well. For the first five to ten minutes you’ll see its E cores are a wall of red and green with Spotlight’s indexing services, CGPDFService, mediaanalysisd, BackgroundShortcutRunner, Siri components, its initial Time Machine backup, and often an XProtect Remediator scan. Meanwhile its P cores are largely idle, and if you were to dive straight into using your working apps, there’s plenty of capacity for them to run unaffected by all that background mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s this stage that scares those who are still accustomed to using Intel Macs. Seeing processes using more than 100% CPU is terrifying, because they know that Intel cores can struggle under so much load, affecting user apps. But on an Apple silicon Mac, who notices or cares that there’s over a dozen mdworker processes each taking a good 50% CPU simultaneously? After all, this is what the Apple silicon architecture is designed for. Admittedly the impression isn’t helped by a dreadful piece of psychology, as those E cores at 100% are probably running at a frequency a quarter of those of P cores shown at the same 100%, making visual comparison completely false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is nothing new. Apple brought it to the iPhone 7 in 2016, in its first SoC with separate P and E cores. That’s an implementation of Arm’s big.LITTLE announced in 2011, and development work at Cray and elsewhere in the previous decade. What makes the difference in Apple silicon Macs is how threads are allocated to the two different CPU core types on the basis of a metric known as Quality of Service, or QoS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with so much in today’s Macs, QoS has been around since OS X 10.10 Yosemite, six years before it became so central in performance. When all CPU cores are the same, it has limited usefulness over more traditional controls like Posix’s &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; scheduling priority. All those background tasks still have to be completed, and giving them a lower priority only prolongs the time they take on the CPU cores, and the period in which the user’s apps are competing with them for CPU cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the experience gained from its iPhones and other devices, Apple’s engineers had a better solution for future Macs. In addition to providing priority-based queues, QoS makes a fundamental distinction between those threads run in the foreground, and those of the background. While foreground threads will be run on P cores when they’re available, they can also be scheduled on E cores when necessary. But background threads aren’t normally allowed to run on P cores, even if they’re delayed by the load on the E cores they’re restricted to. We know this from our inability to promote existing background threads to run on P cores using St. Clair Software’s App Tamer and the command tool &lt;code&gt;taskpolicy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why, even if you sit and watch all those background processes loading the E cores immediately after starting up, leaving the P cores mostly idle, macOS won’t try running them on its P cores. If it did, even if you wanted it to, the distinction between foreground and background, P and E cores would start to fall apart, our apps would suffer as a consequence, and battery endurance would decline. Gone are the days of crashing mdworker processes bringing our Macs to their knees with a spinning beachball every few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If seeing all those processes using high % CPU can look scary, the inevitable consequence in terms of software architecture might seem terrifying. Rather than building monolithic apps, many of their tasks are now broken out into discrete processes run in the background on demand, on the E cores when appropriate. The fact that an idle Mac has over 2,000 threads running in over 600 processes is good news, and the more of those that are run on the E cores, the faster our apps will be. The first and last M-series chips to have only two E cores were the M1 Pro and Max, since when every one has had at least four E cores, and some as many as six or eight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Efficiency cores get the background threads off the cores we need for performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;From: "Cherry, Hei Yui WONG" &amp;lt;cherry.heiyui@keio.jp&amp;gt; Date: Sun, 8 Feb 2026 11:06:40 +0900 Subject: Sad news: Dave Farber has passed away&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are heartbroken to report that our colleague -- our mentor, friend, and conscience -- David J. Farber passed away suddenly at his home in Roppongi, Tokyo. He left us on Saturday, Feb. 7, 2026, at the too-young age of 91.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To his son Manny, he was simply ???Dad???, his bedrock whom he will miss immeasurably. They spoke almost daily by video throughout his time in Japan, and shared special times on numerous visits. He is survived by son Manny Farber and daughter-in-law Mei Xu, daughter-in-law Carol Hagan and grandsons Nate Farber and Sam Farber. He was preceded in death by his wife Gloria (G.G.) and son Joe Farber.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dave???s career began with his education at Stevens Institute of Technology, which he loved deeply and served as a Trustee. He joined the legendary Bell Labs during its heyday, and worked at the Rand Corporation. Along the way, among countless other activities, he served as Chief Technologist of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; became a proficient (instrument-rated) pilot; and was an active board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil-liberties organization.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;His professional accomplishments and impact are almost endless, but often captured by one moniker: ???grandfather of the Internet,??? acknowledging the foundational contributions made by his many students at the University of California, Irvine; the University of Delaware; the University of Pennsylvania; and Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2018, at the age of 83, Dave moved to Japan to become Distinguished Professor at Keio University and Co-Director of the Keio Cyber Civilization Research Center (CCRC). He loved teaching, and taught his final class on January 22, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At CCRC, one of his most enjoyable activities was co-hosting the IP-Asia online gathering, which has met every Monday for more than five years and has addressed many aspects of the impact of technology on civilization. Dave thrived in Japan in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We, the IP-Asia community, will gather for an online remembrance of Dave at the usual time and place, 2100 JST on Monday, February 9, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It???s impossible to summarize a life and career as rich and long as Dave???s in our few words here. And each of us, even those who knew him for decades, represent just one facet of his life. But because we are here at its end, we have the sad duty of sharing this news. Further information and a more formal obituary are forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With condolences to Manny and the rest of the family,&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Sun 08 February 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Networking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;#freebsd, #bgp, #networking, #ipv6, #frr, #pf, #tunneling&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running your own Autonomous System on the public internet sounds like something reserved for ISPs and large enterprises. It’s not. With sponsoring LIRs making AS numbers and IPv6 prefixes accessible to individuals, and FreeBSD providing the routing tools to make it work, you can announce your own address space to the Default-Free Zone from a single virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article walks through the complete setup: obtaining resources from RIPE via a sponsoring LIR, configuring a FreeBSD BGP router with FRR, building GRE/GIF tunnels to distribute prefixes to remote servers, and solving the routing challenge that arises when a server needs to speak from two different IPv6 address spaces simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note on addresses: All provider-assigned IP addresses, hostnames, and management IPs in this article have been replaced with RFC 5737 / RFC 3849 documentation ranges. My own AS number (AS201379) and prefix (2a06:9801:1c::/48) are public BGP resources and shown as-is. The upstream AS numbers (AS34927, AS209735) are equally visible in public routing tables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Run Your Own AS?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provider-assigned IPv6 addresses are tied to that provider. Move to a different hoster and your addresses change - along with DNS records, firewall rules, reputation, and every system that references them. With your own AS and prefix, your addresses follow you. Migrate a server, update a tunnel endpoint, and traffic flows again without touching a single service configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also less practical reasons. Understanding BGP transforms how you think about internet routing. Watching your prefix propagate through the DFZ and appear on looking glasses worldwide is genuinely satisfying. And if you run services across multiple providers, having provider-independent addressing simplifies the architecture considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Obtaining Resources&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To announce prefixes on the internet, you need two things from a Regional Internet Registry (in Europe, that’s RIPE NCC):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An AS number - your identity in BGP. Mine is AS201379.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An IPv6 prefix - the address space you’ll announce. I received 2a06:9801:1c::/48.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an individual, you don’t need to become a RIPE member (which involves fees and bureaucracy). Instead, you work with a sponsoring LIR - an existing RIPE member who sponsors your resource registration. Several LIRs cater to hobbyists and small operators. The process typically involves:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filling out a request form with your intended use case&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating the appropriate RIPE database objects (aut-num, inet6num, route6)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setting up RPKI ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations) to cryptographically bind your prefix to your AS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the paperwork is done, you need upstream connectivity - someone willing to carry your BGP sessions and announce your routes to the rest of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup involves two tiers: a BGP router that peers with upstream providers, and downstream servers that receive tunneled subnets from the router’s /48.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BGP router (&lt;code&gt;router01&lt;/code&gt;) announces 2a06:9801:1c::/48 to two upstream providers and maintains a blackhole route for the aggregate. Individual /64s (and a /62 for my Colocation datacenter) are tunneled to downstream servers via GIF tunnels (IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation). Each server receives real, globally routable addresses from my prefix while keeping its existing provider-assigned IPv6 fully operational.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The BGP Router&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The router runs on a FreeBSD VM at a colocation facility with direct connectivity to two upstream networks. Let’s walk through each layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few things worth explaining:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The blackhole route (&lt;code&gt;-reject&lt;/code&gt;for the /48) is essential. Without it, traffic for unassigned subnets within your prefix would follow the default route back to the upstream, creating a routing loop. The blackhole ensures unrouted traffic is dropped locally.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Point-to-point tunnel addresses use /128 prefixes on the &lt;code&gt;2a06:9801:1c:ffff::/64&lt;/code&gt;link subnet. Each tunnel gets a pair of addresses from this range.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Downstream routes point specific subnets at the far end of each tunnel. The /64 for the VPS and /62 for the datacenter are routed to their respective tunnel endpoints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GRE vs GIF: The iFog peering uses GRE because that’s what the provider requires. The downstream tunnels use GIF (protocol 41, IPv6-in-IPv4) which is simpler and has less overhead.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FRR Configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FRR (Free Range Routing) handles the BGP sessions. The configuration lives at &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/frr/frr.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot happening here. Let me break down the key design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Prefix Lists&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two prefix lists control what gets sent and received:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PL-MY-NET: Matches only our /48. Used in outbound route-maps to ensure we only ever announce our own prefix.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PL-BOGONS: A comprehensive bogon filter for inbound routes. This rejects non-routable address space (link-local, ULA, multicast, documentation ranges), our own prefix (to prevent loops), and anything more specific than a /48 or less specific than a /8. The final &lt;code&gt;permit ::/0 le 48&lt;/code&gt;at the end accepts everything that survived the deny rules.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bogon filter deserves emphasis. Accepting bad routes from peers can cause anything from black-holed traffic to becoming an unwitting participant in route hijacks. Filter aggressively on inbound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Route Maps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each peer gets its own pair of inbound/outbound route maps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outbound to iFog (&lt;code&gt;RM-IFOG-OUT&lt;/code&gt;): Announces our /48 with BGP communities&lt;code&gt;34927:9501&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;34927:9301&lt;/code&gt;. These are iFog-specific communities that control route propagation - in this case, requesting announcement to specific peering partners.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outbound to Lagrange (&lt;code&gt;RM-LAGRANGE-OUT&lt;/code&gt;): Announces our /48 with AS-path prepending (adds our ASN twice). This makes the Lagrange path appear longer to the rest of the internet, steering inbound traffic to prefer the iFog path. Useful for traffic engineering when one upstream has better connectivity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inbound from both: Apply the bogon filter to reject garbage routes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;BGP Session Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;no bgp default ipv4-unicast&lt;/code&gt;: We’re IPv6-only. Don’t activate IPv4 address family by default.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ttl-security hops 1&lt;/code&gt;: GTSM (Generalized TTL Security Mechanism) - reject BGP packets with TTL less than 254. This prevents remote attacks on the BGP session since only directly connected peers can send packets with TTL 255.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;soft-reconfiguration inbound&lt;/code&gt;: Store received routes before applying filters. This lets you change inbound policy without resetting the BGP session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;maximum-prefix 250000 90 restart 30&lt;/code&gt;: Safety valve. If a peer sends more than 250,000 prefixes (or 90% of that as a warning), tear down the session and retry after 30 minutes. Protects against route leaks from upstream.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Firewall on the Router&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BGP router’s PF configuration protects the control plane while allowing data plane forwarding:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The firewall cleanly separates control plane (SSH, BGP sessions) from data plane (forwarded traffic). The control plane rules are strict: BGP is locked to known peer addresses, SSH to trusted management IPs. The data plane rules are simpler since the router just needs to forward packets between upstreams and downstream tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;block in quick on $ext_if from { &amp;lt;bogons&amp;gt;, $my_network_v6 }&lt;/code&gt; rule is important - it drops packets claiming to come from our own prefix arriving on the external interface. If someone on the internet spoofs a source address from our range, this catches it before it enters the forwarding path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the per-tunnel MSS clamping in the scrub section. Each tunnel has different overhead (GRE adds more headers than GIF), so the MSS values differ. Getting this wrong causes mysterious connection stalls with large packets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Downstream Server: Dual-Stack with Policy Routing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where things get interesting. The VPS (&lt;code&gt;vps01&lt;/code&gt;) already has provider-assigned IPv6 from its hoster. Jails on this server use addresses from both address spaces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Provider IPv6 (2001:db8:200:0:1000::/68) - the hoster’s addresses, NATed to the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BGP IPv6 (2a06:9801:1c:1000::/64) - our own prefix, routed natively via the GIF tunnel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Private IPv4 (10.254.254.0/24) - NATed to the host’s public IPv4&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge: when a jail sends traffic from its BGP address (2a06:…), that traffic must exit through the GIF tunnel to the BGP router - not through the default route to the VPS provider, where it would be dropped as spoofed. But traffic from the provider address must continue using the normal default route.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is dual-FIB policy routing - FreeBSD’s implementation of multiple routing tables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Dual-FIB Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD supports multiple routing tables called FIBs (Forwarding Information Bases). Each FIB is an independent routing table with its own default route and entries. Interfaces and PF rules can assign traffic to a specific FIB, and the kernel consults the appropriate table when forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;FIB 0 (default):
  default --&amp;gt; vtnet0 --&amp;gt; VPS provider upstream
  Used by: host traffic, provider-addressed jail traffic

FIB 1:
  default --&amp;gt; gif0 --&amp;gt; BGP router (router01)
  Used by: BGP-addressed jail traffic (2a06:9801:1c::/48)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Network Configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the relevant portion of the server’s &lt;code&gt;/etc/rc.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;hostname="vps01.example.com"

route_bgplink="-6 2a06:9801:1c:1000::/64 -interface bastille0 -fib 1"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GIF tunnel configuration deserves a closer look:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ifconfig_gif0="fib 1 tunnel 203.0.113.10 198.51.100.10 tunnelfib 0"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This single line contains two critical directives:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fib 1&lt;/code&gt;: The tunnel interface itself lives in FIB 1. Traffic arriving on gif0 and traffic routed out gif0 consults routing table 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tunnelfib 0&lt;/code&gt;: But the outer IPv4 encapsulation (the 203.0.113.10 —&amp;gt; 198.51.100.10 wrapper) uses FIB 0. This is essential - the IPv4 path to the BGP router goes through the provider’s default route in FIB 0. Without&lt;code&gt;tunnelfib 0&lt;/code&gt;, the encapsulated packets would try to use FIB 1’s default route (which points at gif0 itself), creating a recursive loop.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three static routes in FIB 1 complete the picture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fib1default&lt;/code&gt;: Default route in FIB 1 exits through gif0 to the BGP router&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;jailleak&lt;/code&gt;: Tells FIB 1 that the provider’s jail subnet is reachable via bastille0 (without this, return traffic in FIB 1 for jails’ provider addresses would try to exit through gif0)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;bgplink&lt;/code&gt;: Same for the BGP jail subnet - FIB 1 needs to know these addresses are local on bastille0&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PF: The Routing Glue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PF is where the address-based routing decision happens. When a jail sends a packet from a BGP address, PF assigns it to FIB 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# BGP-addressed jail traffic --&amp;gt; force into routing table 1 (exits via gif0)
pass in quick on bastille0 inet6 from $bgp_net to any rtable 1 keep state
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rtable 1&lt;/code&gt; directive is the key. It tells PF to route matching packets using FIB 1 instead of the default FIB 0. Since FIB 1’s default route points out gif0 to the BGP router, these packets get encapsulated and sent to router01, which then forwards them to the internet with the correct source address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For traffic arriving on the tunnel destined for jails, PF uses &lt;code&gt;reply-to&lt;/code&gt; to ensure return traffic takes the same path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Inbound BGP traffic - reply-to ensures responses exit via gif0
pass in quick on $tun_if reply-to ($tun_if $bgp_hub_ip) inet6 \
    from any to $bgp_net keep state

# BGP ICMPv6 - also needs reply-to for correct return path
pass in quick on $tun_if reply-to ($tun_if $bgp_hub_ip) inet6 proto ipv6-icmp \
    from any to $bgp_net \
    icmp6-type { echoreq, echorep, toobig, timex, paramprob } \
    keep state
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without &lt;code&gt;reply-to&lt;/code&gt;, the kernel would consult FIB 0 for return traffic (since the jail itself isn’t in FIB 1), and replies to BGP-addressed connections would exit through vtnet0 with the wrong source routing - getting dropped as spoofed by the provider. The &lt;code&gt;reply-to&lt;/code&gt; directive forces PF to send reply packets back out the interface they arrived on, to the specified next-hop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Complete Picture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how a request to a BGP-addressed jail service flows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 1. Client sends packet to 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10 (web jail)
 2. Packet traverses the internet, reaching AS201379 via iFog or Lagrange
 3. router01 forwards it through gif0 tunnel to vps01
 4. vps01 receives proto 41 on vtnet0, decapsulates --&amp;gt; gif0
 5. PF matches: reply-to ($tun_if $bgp_hub_ip), creates state
 6. Packet forwarded to bastille0 --&amp;gt; jail
 7. Jail responds, packet exits on bastille0
 8. PF's state table triggers reply-to: send via gif0 to bgp_hub_ip
 9. gif0 encapsulates (proto 41) using FIB 0 to reach router01
10. router01 receives, forwards to upstream --&amp;gt; internet --&amp;gt; client
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for outbound connections initiated by the jail using its BGP address:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;1. Jail sends packet from 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
2. Packet arrives on bastille0
3. PF matches: "from $bgp_net --&amp;gt; rtable 1"
4. Kernel routes via FIB 1 --&amp;gt; default route --&amp;gt; gif0
5. gif0 encapsulates using FIB 0 --&amp;gt; vtnet0 --&amp;gt; router01
6. router01 receives, forwards to internet (source: 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the exact same jail can communicate using its provider address through the normal default route in FIB 0, with NAT to the host’s address. Both address spaces coexist on the same interface, differentiated purely by PF rules and FIB selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once everything is running, verification is straightforward. From inside a jail with both addresses:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Traffic from the provider address - NATed through the hoster
root@caddy:~ # curl --interface 2001:db8:200:0:1000::10 https://ifconfig.co
2001:db8:200::2

# Traffic from the BGP address - routed natively through the tunnel
root@caddy:~ # curl --interface 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10 https://ifconfig.co
2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first request shows the host’s NATed provider address. The second shows the jail’s real BGP address - confirming the packet traversed the tunnel and reached the internet through AS201379.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A traceroute from an external host confirms the BGP path is working:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Traffic enters via the transit provider (hops 9-10), traverses the GRE tunnel to router01 (hop 11), then the GIF tunnel to vps01 (hop 12, the &lt;code&gt;2a06:9801:1c:ffff::2&lt;/code&gt; link address), and finally reaches the jail (hop 13). The prefix also shows up correctly on bgp.tools as active and originated by AS201379 with both upstreams visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MSS clamping is non-negotiable with tunnels. Every layer of encapsulation eats into the MTU. GIF adds 20 bytes (IPv4 header) to every packet. GRE adds more. If you don’t clamp the TCP MSS, large packets get fragmented or dropped, causing mysterious failures where small requests work but large transfers stall. Set &lt;code&gt;max-mss&lt;/code&gt; in PF’s scrub rules for every tunnel interface, calculated as: MTU minus IPv6 header (40 bytes) minus TCP header (20 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FIB separation is cleaner than source-based routing hacks. FreeBSD’s multi-FIB support is a first-class feature. Using &lt;code&gt;rtable&lt;/code&gt; in PF and &lt;code&gt;fib&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tunnelfib&lt;/code&gt; on interfaces gives you full control over which routing table handles which traffic. It’s conceptually cleaner and more debuggable than alternatives like ip6tables MARK targets on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bogon filtering matters even for small networks. The internet is full of misconfigurations and occasional malice. Filtering inbound routes prevents your router from accepting nonsense that could black-hole traffic or worse. The cost is a few lines of configuration; the protection is real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;reply-to&lt;/code&gt; solves asymmetric routing. When traffic can arrive on multiple interfaces, the kernel’s default FIB selection for return traffic may choose the wrong path. PF’s &lt;code&gt;reply-to&lt;/code&gt; directive forces replies back out the arrival interface, which is exactly what you need for tunnel overlay setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start with two upstreams. A single upstream means zero redundancy and no ability to do traffic engineering. Two upstreams give you failover and the ability to prefer one path over the other using AS-path prepending or communities. The operational complexity increase is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running your own AS on the internet is more accessible than most people assume. The barrier isn’t technical complexity - it’s knowing that the option exists. A FreeBSD VM, FRR, a couple of tunnels, and some careful PF rules give you provider-independent addressing, real BGP peering, and a deeper understanding of how the internet actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dual-FIB approach on the downstream server is the piece I’m most satisfied with. It elegantly solves the “two address spaces, one server” problem without hacks: BGP traffic takes the tunnel, provider traffic takes the default route, and PF’s &lt;code&gt;rtable&lt;/code&gt; directive makes the decision based purely on source address. Both paths coexist transparently, and the jails don’t need to know anything about the routing underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it overkill for a blog? Absolutely. But the same infrastructure carries every service I run, and having addresses that survive provider migrations has already paid for itself in operational simplicity. Besides, there’s something deeply satisfying about seeing your own AS number show up in a traceroute.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I felt the familiar feeling of depression and lethargy creep in while my eyes darted from watching claude-code work and my phone. “What’s the point of it all?” I thought, LLMs can generate decent-ish and correct-ish looking code while I have more time to do what? doomscroll? This was the third time I gave claude-code a try. I felt the same feelings every single time and ended up deleting claude-code after 2-3 weeks, and whaddyouknow? Every. Single. Time. I rediscovered the joy of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, coding is not software engineering, but for me, it is a fun and essential part of it. In order to be effective at software engineering, you must be familiar with the problem space, and this requires thinking and wrestling with the problem. You can’t truly know the pain of using an API by just reading its documentation or implementation. You have to use it to experience it. The act of writing code, despite being slower, was a way for me to wrestle with the problem space, a way for me to find out that my initial ideas didn’t work, a way for thinking. Vibe coding interfered with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;– Leslie Lamport&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other major part of the job is to ensure correctness. For me, it is much harder to verify the correctness of code I didn’t write compared to code I wrote. The process of writing code helps internalize the context and is easier for my brain to think deeply about it. If I outsource this to an LLM, I skip over the process of internalizing the problem domain and I can’t be certain that the generated code is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By design, vibe coding has an addictive nature to it, you write some instructions, and code that looks correct is generated. Bam! Dopamine hit! If the code isn’t correct, then it’s just one prompt away from being correct, right? right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibe coding also has the profound effect of turning my brain off and passively accepting changes. When it is time to use my brain, the inertia is much harder to overcome and it is easy to choose the lazy way out. At my lowest point, I even asked it to do a find-and-replace in a file. Something that takes a few seconds, now took minutes and a network call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if I generate a 1,000 line PR in 30 minutes I still need to understand and review it. Since I am responsible for the code I ship, this makes me the bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common view of vibe coding is that it is neither good nor bad, it is a tool. But tools shape your workflow and your thought process, and if a tool prevents you from thinking deeply, I don’t think it is a good tool. If you are a knowledge worker, your core competency is your ability to think, and if a tool interferes with that, be afraid, be very afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I would be lying if I said I didn’t use LLMs to generate code. I still use Claude, but I do so in a more controlled manner. I copy-paste files that I think are necessary to provide the context, and then I copy-paste code and ask it to make changes to it or write tests for it. This friction has several benefits. I can’t make changes that span multiple files, this means the generated diff isn’t too large, and if I have to manually change other files I know how the code fits in. Manually giving claude the context forces me to be familiar with the codebase myself, rather than tell it to just “cook”. It turns code generation from a passive action to a deliberate thoughtful action. It also keeps my brain engaged and active, which means I can still enter the flow state. I have found this to be the best of both worlds and a way to preserve my happiness at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, life is too short to not optimize for happiness. Maybe (a big maybe) generating entire features would make me more productive, but if it causes existential dread and makes me depressed, I don’t see it being productive in the long run. Maybe you relate to some of the feelings. Maybe you don’t. But don’t be afraid to choose differently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career. I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career. These two facts are not unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I build AI agent infrastructure for a living. I'm one of the core maintainers of OpenFGA (CNCF Incubating), I built agentic-authz for agent authorization, I built Distill for context deduplication, I shipped MCP servers. I'm not someone who dabbles with AI on the side. I'm deep in it. I build the tools that other engineers use to make AI agents work in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, I hit a wall. The kind of exhaustion that no amount of tooling or workflow optimization could fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're an engineer who uses AI daily - for design reviews, code generation, debugging, documentation, architecture decisions - and you've noticed that you're somehow more tired than before AI existed, this post is for you. You're not imagining it. You're not weak. You're experiencing something real that the industry is aggressively pretending doesn't exist. And if someone who builds agent infrastructure full-time can burn out on AI, it can happen to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to talk about it honestly. Not the "AI is amazing and here's my workflow" version. The real version. The one where you stare at your screen at 11pm, surrounded by AI-generated code you still need to review, wondering why the tool that was supposed to save you time has consumed your entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The paradox nobody warned us about&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing that broke my brain for a while: AI genuinely makes individual tasks faster. That's not a lie. What used to take me 3 hours now takes 45 minutes. Drafting a design doc, scaffolding a new service, writing test cases, researching an unfamiliar API. All faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But my days got harder. Not easier. Harder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason is simple once you see it, but it took me months to figure out. When each task takes less time, you don't do fewer tasks. You do more tasks. Your capacity appears to expand, so the work expands to fill it. And then some. Your manager sees you shipping faster, so the expectations adjust. You see yourself shipping faster, so your own expectations adjust. The baseline moves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before AI, I might spend a full day on one design problem. I'd sketch on paper, think in the shower, go for a walk, come back with clarity. The pace was slow but the cognitive load was manageable. One problem. One day. Deep focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now? I might touch six different problems in a day. Each one "only takes an hour with AI." But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the paradox: AI reduces the cost of production but increases the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making. And those costs fall entirely on the human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You became a reviewer and you didn't sign up for it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before AI, my job was: think about a problem, write code, test it, ship it. I was the creator. The maker. That's what drew most of us to engineering in the first place - the act of building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After AI, my job increasingly became: prompt, wait, read output, evaluate output, decide if output is correct, decide if output is safe, decide if output matches the architecture, fix the parts that don't, re-prompt, repeat. I became a reviewer. A judge. A quality inspector on an assembly line that never stops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fundamentally different kind of work. Creating is energizing. Reviewing is draining. There's research on this - the psychological difference between generative tasks and evaluative tasks. Generative work gives you flow states. Evaluative work gives you decision fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed it first during a week where I was using AI heavily for a new microservice. By Wednesday, I couldn't make simple decisions anymore. What should this function be named? I didn't care. Where should this config live? I didn't care. My brain was full. Not from writing code - from judging code. Hundreds of small judgments, all day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cruel irony is that AI-generated code requires more careful review than human-written code. When a colleague writes code, I know their patterns, their strengths, their blind spots. I can skim the parts I trust and focus on the parts I don't. With AI, every line is suspect. The code looks confident. It compiles. It might even pass tests. But it could be subtly wrong in ways that only surface in production, under load, at 3am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you read every line. And reading code you didn't write, that was generated by a system that doesn't understand your codebase's history or your team's conventions, is exhausting work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also why I think agent security and authorization matter so much. If we can't review everything AI produces - and we can't, not at scale - then we need systems that constrain what agents can do in the first place. Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, audit trails. The less you have to worry about "did the AI do something dangerous," the more cognitive budget you have for the work that actually matters. This isn't just a security problem. It's a human sustainability problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The nondeterminism problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers are trained on determinism. Same input, same output. That's the contract. That's what makes debugging possible. That's what makes reasoning about systems possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI broke that contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had a prompt that worked perfectly on Monday. Generated clean, well-structured code for an API endpoint. I used the same prompt on Tuesday for a similar endpoint. The output was structurally different, used a different error handling pattern, and introduced a dependency I didn't ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? No reason. Or rather, no reason I can access. There's no stack trace for "the model decided to go a different direction today." There's no log that says "temperature sampling chose path B instead of path A." It just... happened differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For someone whose entire career is built on "if it broke, I can find out why," this is deeply unsettling. Not in a dramatic way. In a slow, grinding, background-anxiety way. You can never fully trust the output. You can never fully relax. Every interaction requires vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to fight this. I version-controlled my prompts. I built elaborate system messages. I created templates. Some of it helped. None of it solved the fundamental problem: you are collaborating with a probabilistic system, and your brain is wired for deterministic ones. That mismatch is a constant, low-grade source of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This frustration is actually what led me to build Distill - deterministic context deduplication for LLMs. No LLM calls, no embeddings, no probabilistic heuristics. Pure algorithms that clean your context in ~12ms. I wanted at least one part of the AI pipeline to be something I could reason about, debug, and trust. If the model's output is going to be nondeterministic, the least I can do is make sure the input is clean and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineers I've talked to who handle this best are the ones who've made peace with it. They treat AI output like a first draft from a smart but unreliable intern. They expect to rewrite 30% of it. They budget time for that rewriting. They don't get frustrated when the output is wrong because they never expected it to be right. They expected it to be useful. There's a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The FOMO treadmill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a breath and try to keep up with just the last few months. Claude Code ships sub-agents, then skills, then an Agent SDK, then Claude Cowork. OpenAI launches Codex CLI, then GPT-5.3-Codex - a model that literally helped code itself. New coding agents announce background mode with hundreds of concurrent autonomous sessions. Google drops Gemini CLI. GitHub adds an MCP Registry. Acquisitions happen weekly. Amazon Q Developer gets agentic upgrades. CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, MetaGPT - pick your agent framework, there's a new one every week. Google announces A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol) to compete with Anthropic's MCP. OpenAI ships its own Swarm framework. Kimi K2.5 drops with agent swarm architecture orchestrating 100 parallel agents. "Vibe coding" becomes a thing. OpenClaw launches a skills marketplace and within one week, researchers find 400+ malicious agent skills uploaded to ClawHub. And somewhere in the middle of all this, someone on LinkedIn posts "if you're not using AI agents with sub-agent orchestration in 2026, you're already obsolete."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's not a year. That's a few months. And I'm leaving stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fell into this trap hard. I was spending weekends evaluating new tools. Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what that actually looked like: I'd spend Saturday afternoon setting up a new AI coding tool. By Sunday I'd have a basic workflow. By the following Wednesday, someone would post about a different tool that was "way better." I'd feel a pang of anxiety. By the next weekend, I'd be setting up the new thing. The old thing would sit unused. One coding assistant to the next to the next and back to the first one. Each migration cost me a weekend and gave me maybe a 5% improvement that I couldn't even measure properly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiply this by every category - coding assistants, chat interfaces, agent frameworks, multi-agent orchestration platforms, MCP servers, context management tools, prompt libraries, swarm architectures, skills marketplaces - and you get a person who is perpetually learning new tools and never getting deep with any of them. The Hacker News front page alone is enough to give you whiplash. One day it's "Show HN: Autonomous Research Swarm" and the next it's "Ask HN: How will AI swarms coordinate?" Nobody knows. Everyone's building anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The worst part is the knowledge decay. I spent two weeks building a sophisticated prompt engineering workflow in early 2025. Carefully crafted system prompts, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought templates. It worked well. Three months later, the model updated, the prompting best practices shifted, and half my templates produced worse results than a simple one-liner. Those two weeks were gone. Not invested. Spent. The same thing happened with my MCP server setup - I built five custom servers (Dev.to publisher, Apple Notes integration, Python and TypeScript sandboxes, more), then the protocol evolved, then the MCP Registry launched on GitHub and suddenly there were thousands of pre-built ones. Some of my custom work became redundant overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent framework churn is even worse. I watched teams go from LangChain to CrewAI to AutoGen to custom orchestration in the span of a year. Each migration meant rewriting integrations, relearning APIs, rebuilding workflows. The people who waited and did nothing often ended up in a better position than the people who adopted early and had to migrate twice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've since adopted a different approach. Instead of chasing every new tool, I go deep on the infrastructure layer underneath them. Tools come and go. The problems they solve don't. Context efficiency, agent authorization, audit trails, runtime security - these are durable problems regardless of which framework is trending this month. That's why I built agentic-authz on OpenFGA instead of tying it to any specific agent framework. That's why Distill works at the context level, not the prompt level. Build on the layer that doesn't churn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still track the landscape closely - you have to when you're building infrastructure for it. But I track it to understand where the ecosystem is going, not to adopt every new thing. There's a difference between being informed and being reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The "just one more prompt" trap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is insidious. You're trying to get AI to generate something specific. The first output is 70% right. So you refine your prompt. The second output is 75% right but broke something the first one had correct. Third attempt: 80% right but now the structure is different. Fourth attempt: you've been at this for 45 minutes and you could have written the thing from scratch in 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I call this the prompt spiral. It's the AI equivalent of yak shaving. You started with a clear goal. Thirty minutes later you're debugging your prompt instead of debugging your code. You're optimizing your instructions to a language model instead of solving the actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prompt spiral is especially dangerous because it feels productive. You're iterating. You're getting closer. Each attempt is slightly better. But the marginal returns are diminishing fast, and you've lost sight of the fact that the goal was never "get the AI to produce perfect output." The goal was to ship the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now have a hard rule: three attempts. If the AI doesn't get me to 70% usable in three prompts, I write it myself. No exceptions. This single rule has saved me more time than any prompting technique I've ever learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Perfectionism meets probabilistic output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers tend toward perfectionism. We like clean code. We like tests that pass. We like systems that behave predictably. This is a feature, not a bug - it's what makes us good at building reliable software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI output is never perfect. It's always "pretty good." 70-80% there. The variable names are slightly off. The error handling is incomplete. The edge cases are ignored. The abstraction is wrong for your codebase. It works, but it's not right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a perfectionist, this is torture. Because "almost right" is worse than "completely wrong." Completely wrong, you throw away and start over. Almost right, you spend an hour tweaking. And tweaking AI output is uniquely frustrating because you're fixing someone else's design decisions - decisions that were made by a system that doesn't share your taste, your context, or your standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had to learn to let go. Not of quality - I still care about quality. But of the expectation that AI would produce quality. I now treat every AI output as a rough draft. A starting point. Raw material. I mentally label it "draft" the moment it appears, and that framing change alone reduced my frustration by half.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineers who struggle most with AI are often the best engineers. The ones with the highest standards. The ones who notice every imperfection. AI rewards a different skill: the ability to extract value from imperfect output quickly, without getting emotionally invested in making it perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The thinking atrophy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the one that scares me most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed it during a design review meeting. Someone asked me to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard. No laptop. No AI. Just me and a marker. And I struggled. Not because I didn't know the concepts - I did. But because I hadn't exercised that muscle in months. I'd been outsourcing my first-draft thinking to AI for so long that my ability to think from scratch had degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes. After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same thing is happening with AI and engineering thinking. When you always ask AI first, you stop building the neural pathways that come from struggling with a problem yourself. The struggle is where learning happens. The confusion is where understanding forms. Skip that, and you get faster output but shallower understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now deliberately spend the first hour of my day without AI. I think on paper. I sketch architectures by hand. I reason through problems the slow way. It feels inefficient. It is inefficient. But it keeps my thinking sharp, and that sharpness pays dividends for the rest of the day when I do use AI - because I can evaluate its output better when my own reasoning is warmed up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The comparison trap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media is full of people who seem to have AI figured out. They post their workflows. Their productivity numbers. Their "I built this entire app in 2 hours with AI" threads. And you look at your own experience - the failed prompts, the wasted time, the code you had to rewrite - and you think: what's wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing is wrong with you. Those threads are highlight reels. Nobody posts "I spent 3 hours trying to get Claude to understand my database schema and eventually gave up and wrote the migration by hand." Nobody posts "AI-generated code caused a production incident because it silently swallowed an error." Nobody posts "I'm tired."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comparison trap is amplified by the fact that AI skill is hard to measure. With traditional engineering, you can look at someone's code and roughly gauge their ability. With AI, the output depends on the model, the prompt, the context, the temperature, the phase of the moon. Someone's impressive demo might not reproduce on your machine with your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I became much more selective about AI content on social media. I still follow the space closely - I have to, it's my job. But I shifted from consuming everyone's hot takes to focusing on people who are actually building and shipping, not just demoing. The ratio of signal to anxiety matters. If a feed is making you feel behind instead of informed, it's not serving you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What actually helped&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll be specific about what changed my relationship with AI from adversarial to sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time-boxing AI sessions. I don't use AI in an open-ended way anymore. I set a timer. 30 minutes for this task with AI. When the timer goes off, I ship what I have or switch to writing it myself. This prevents the prompt spiral and the perfectionism trap simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separating AI time from thinking time. Morning is for thinking. Afternoon is for AI-assisted execution. This isn't rigid - sometimes I break the rule. But having a default structure means my brain gets both exercise and assistance in the right proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accepting 70% from AI. I stopped trying to get perfect output. 70% usable is the bar. I'll fix the rest myself. This acceptance was the single biggest reducer of AI-related frustration in my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being strategic about the hype cycle. I track the AI landscape because I build infrastructure for it. But I stopped adopting every new tool the week it launches. I use one primary coding assistant and know it deeply. I evaluate new tools when they've proven themselves over months, not days. Staying informed and staying reactive are different things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logging where AI helps and where it doesn't. I kept a simple log for two weeks: task, used AI (yes/no), time spent, satisfaction with result. The data was revealing. AI saved me significant time on boilerplate, documentation, and test generation. It cost me time on architecture decisions, complex debugging, and anything requiring deep context about my codebase. Now I know when to reach for it and when not to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not reviewing everything AI produces. This was hard to accept. But if you're using AI to generate large amounts of code, you physically cannot review every line with the same rigor. I focus my review energy on the parts that matter most - security boundaries, data handling, error paths - and rely on automated tests and static analysis for the rest. Some roughness in non-critical code is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The sustainability question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tech industry has a burnout problem that predates AI. AI is making it worse, not better. Not because AI is bad, but because AI removes the natural speed limits that used to protect us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before AI, there was a ceiling on how much you could produce in a day. That ceiling was set by typing speed, thinking speed, the time it takes to look things up. It was frustrating sometimes, but it was also a governor. You couldn't work yourself to death because the work itself imposed limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI removed the governor. Now the only limit is your cognitive endurance. And most people don't know their cognitive limits until they've blown past them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I burned out in late 2025. Not dramatically - I didn't quit or have a breakdown. I just stopped caring. Code reviews became rubber stamps. Design decisions became "whatever AI suggests." I was going through the motions, producing more than ever, feeling less than ever. It took me a month to realize what had happened and another month to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recovery wasn't about using less AI. It was about using AI differently. With boundaries. With intention. With the understanding that I am not a machine and I don't need to keep pace with one. Working at Ona helped me see this clearly - when you're building AI agent infrastructure for enterprise customers, you see the human cost of unsustainable AI workflows at scale. The problems aren't just personal. They're systemic. And they need to be solved at the tooling level, not just the individual level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, the burnout period is when some of my best work happened. When I stopped trying to use every AI tool and started thinking about what was actually broken, I saw the problems clearly for the first time. Context windows filling up with garbage - that became Distill. Agents with all-or-nothing API key access - that became agentic-authz. The inability to audit what an agent actually did - that's becoming AgentTrace. The fatigue forced me to stop consuming and start building. Not building more features faster, but building the right things deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The real skill&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what I think the real skill of the AI era is. It's not prompt engineering. It's not knowing which model to use. It's not having the perfect workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's knowing when to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing when the AI output is good enough. Knowing when to write it yourself. Knowing when to close the laptop. Knowing when the marginal improvement isn't worth the cognitive cost. Knowing that your brain is a finite resource and that protecting it is not laziness - it's engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We optimize our systems for sustainability. We add circuit breakers. We implement backpressure. We design for graceful degradation. We should do the same for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is the most powerful tool I've ever used. It's also the most draining. Both things are true. The engineers who thrive in this era won't be the ones who use AI the most. They'll be the ones who use it the most wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're tired, it's not because you're doing it wrong. It's because this is genuinely hard. The tool is new, the patterns are still forming, and the industry is pretending that more output equals more value. It doesn't. Sustainable output does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still building in this space every day. Agent authorization, context engineering, audit trails, runtime security - the infrastructure that makes AI agents actually work in production. I'm more committed to AI than ever. But I'm committed on my terms, at my pace, building things that matter instead of chasing things that trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take care of your brain. It's the only one you've got, and no AI can replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this resonated, I'd love to hear your experience. What does AI fatigue look like for you? Find me on X or LinkedIn, or join the discussion on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I write about AI agent infrastructure, security, context engineering, and the human side of building with AI. You can find all my writing on my writing page.&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction Approximately 212 RFCs, or about 7% of RFCs issued so far, starting with [RFC269], contain the terms `foo', `bar', or `foobar' used as a metasyntactic variable without any proper explanation or definition. This may seem trivial, but a number of newcomers, especially if English is not their native language, have had problems in understanding the origin of those terms. This document rectifies that deficiency. Eastlake, et al. Informational [Page 1]&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt; RFC 3092 Etymology of "Foo" 1 April 2001 Section 2 below describes the definition and etymology of these words and Section 3 interprets them as acronyms. As an Appendix, we include a table of RFC occurrences of these words as metasyntactic variables. 2. Definition and Etymology bar /bar/ n. [JARGON] 1. The second metasyntactic variable, after foo and before baz. "Suppose we have two functions: FOO and BAR. FOO calls BAR...." 2. Often appended to foo to produce foobar. foo /foo/ 1. interj. Term of disgust. 2. Used very generally as a sample name for absolutely anything, esp. programs and files (esp. scratch files). 3. First on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in syntax examples (bar, baz, qux, quux, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud). [JARGON] When used in connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the WW II era Army slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All Repair'), later modified to foobar. Early versions of the Jargon File [JARGON] interpreted this change as a post-war bowdlerization, but it now seems more likely that FUBAR was itself a derivative of `foo' perhaps influenced by German `furchtbar' (terrible) - `foobar' may actually have been the original form. For, it seems, the word `foo' itself had an immediate prewar history in comic strips and cartoons. In the 1938 Warner Brothers cartoon directed by Robert Clampett, "The Daffy Doc", a very early version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying "SILENCE IS FOO!" `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's "Pogo" strips. The earliest documented uses were in the surrealist "Smokey Stover" comic strip by Bill Holman about a fireman. This comic strip appeared in various American comics including "Everybody's" between about 1930 and 1952. It frequently included the word "FOO" on license plates of cars, in nonsense sayings in the background of some frames such as "He who foos last foos best" or "Many smoke but foo men chew", and had Smokey say "Where there's foo, there's fire". Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled it with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other Eastlake, et al. Informational [Page 2]&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt; RFC 3092 Etymology of "Foo" 1 April 2001 nonsense phrases such as "Notary Sojac" and "1506 nix nix". According to the Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion [WBCC] Holman claimed to have found the word "foo" on the bottom of a Chinese figurine. This is plausible; Chinese statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and this may have been the Chinese word `fu' (sometimes transliterated `foo'), which can mean "happiness" when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese restaurants are properly called "fu dogs") [PERS]. English speakers' reception of Holman's `foo' nonsense word was undoubtedly influenced by Yiddish `feh' and English `fooey' and `fool'. [JARGON, FOLDOC] Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode on two wheels. The comic strip was tremendously popular in the late 1930s, and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even produced an operable version of Holman's Foomobile. According to the Encyclopedia of American Comics [EAC], `Foo' fever swept the U.S., finding its way into popular songs and generating over 500 `Foo Clubs.' The fad left `foo' references embedded in popular culture (including the couple of appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of 1938-39) but with their origins rapidly forgotten. [JARGON] One place they are known to have remained live is in the U.S. military during the WWII years. In 1944-45, the term `foo fighters' [FF] was in use by radar operators for the kind of mysterious or spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced in popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better grunge-rock bands [BFF]). Informants connected the term to the Smokey Stover strip [PERS]. The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms during the war. Period sources reported that `FOO' became a semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army graffiti more or less equivalent to the American Kilroy [WORDS]. Where British troops went, the graffito "FOO was here" or something similar showed up. Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous "FUBAR") was probably a backronym [JARGON]. Forty years later, Paul Dickson's excellent book "Words" [WORDS] traced "Foo" to an unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows: "Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with bitter omniscience and sarcasm." Earlier versions of the Jargon File suggested the possibility that hacker usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and Parody", the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint Eastlake, et al. Informational [Page 3]&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt; RFC 3092 Etymology of "Foo" 1 April 2001 project of Charles and Robert Crumb. Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens) later became one of the most important and influential artists in underground comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers later burned most of the existing copies in disgust. The title FOO was featured in large letters on the front cover. However, very few copies of this comic actually circulated, and students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have established that this title was a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics. The Crumbs may also have been influenced by a short-lived Canadian parody magazine named `Foo' published in 1951-52. [JARGON] An old-time member reports that in the 1959 "Dictionary of the TMRC Language", compiled at TMRC (the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT) there was an entry for Foo. The current on-line version, in which "Foo" is the only word coded to appear red, has the following [TMRC]: Foo: The sacred syllable (FOO MANI PADME HUM); to be spoken only when under obligation to commune with the Deity. Our first obligation is to keep the Foo Counters turning. This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense word, then only two decades old and demonstrably still live in popular culture and slang, to make a "ha ha only serious" analogy with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism. Today's hackers would find it difficult to resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's were any less susceptible. [JARGON] 4. [EF] Prince Foo was the last ruler of Pheebor and owner of the Phee Helm, about 400 years before the reign of Entharion. When Foo was beheaded by someone he called an "eastern fop" from Borphee, the glorious age of Pheebor ended, and Borphee rose to the prominence it now enjoys. 5. [OED] A 13th-16th century usage for the devil or any other enemy. The earliest citation it gives is from the year 1366, Chaucer A B C (84): "Lat not our alder foo [devil] make his bobance [boast]". Chaucer's "Foo" is probably related to modern English "foe". 6. Rare species of dog. A spitz-type dog discovered to exist after having long been considered extinct, the Chinese Foo Dog, or Sacred Dog of Sinkiang, may have originated through a crossing of Northern European hunting dogs and the ancient Chow Chow from Mongolia or be the missing link between the Chinese Wolf and the Chow Chow. It probably derives its name from foochow, of the kind or style Eastlake, et al. Informational [Page 4]&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt; RFC 3092 Etymology of "Foo" 1 April 2001 prevalent in Foochow, of or from the city of Foochow (now Minhow) in southeast China. [DOG] foobar n. [JARGON] A widely used metasyntactic variable; see foo for etymology. Probably originally propagated through DECsystem manuals by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1960s and early 1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972. Hackers do not generally use this to mean FUBAR in either the slang or jargon sense. It has been plausibly suggested that "foobar" spread among early computer engineers partly because of FUBAR and partly because "foo bar" parses in electronics techspeak as an inverted foo signal. foo-fighter n. World War II term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) noted by both German and British military. See [FF] and entry above for "foo". 3.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Noam Chomsky's wife responds to Epstein controversy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;"Noam’s overly trusting nature, in this specific case, led to severe poor judgment on both our parts... we express our unrestricted solidarity with the victims."&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Noam Chomsky’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein has become the source of controversy. After suffering a severe stroke in June 2023, Chomsky is unable to comment on it. His wife Valeria has responded to questions surrounding their contacts with Epstein in the statement below. I am publishing it here, with minor typographical corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Statement from Valéria Chomsky&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As many are aware, my husband, Noam Chomsky, now 97, is confronting significant health challenges after suffering a devastating stroke in June 2023. Currently, Noam is under 24/7 medical care and is completely unable to speak or engage in public discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since this health crisis, I have been entirely absorbed in Noam’s treatment and recovery, solely responsible for him and his medical treatment. Noam and I don’t have any kind of public relations assistance. For this reason, only now have I been able to address the matter of our contacts with Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noam and I have felt a profound weight regarding the unresolved questions surrounding our past interactions with Epstein. We do not wish to leave this chapter shrouded in ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Noam has insisted that intellectuals have a responsibility to speak the truth and expose lies — especially when those truths are uncomfortable to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is widely known, one of Noam’s characteristics is to believe in the good faith of people. Noam’s overly trust[ing] nature, in this specific case, led to severe poor judgment on both our parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Questions have rightly been raised about Noam’s meetings with Epstein, and about administrative assistance his office provided regarding a private financial matter—one that had absolutely no relation to any of Epstein’s criminal conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noam and I were introduced to Epstein at the same time, during one of Noam’s professional events in 2015, when Epstein’s 2008 conviction in the State of Florida was known by very few people, while most of the public – including Noam and I – was unaware of it. That only changed after the November 2018 report by Miami Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we were introduced to Epstein, he presented himself as a philanthropist of science and a financial expert. By presenting himself this way, Epstein gained Noam’s attention, and they began corresponding. Unknowingly, we opened a door to a Trojan horse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epstein began to encircle Noam, sending gifts and creating opportunities for interesting discussions in areas Noam has been working on extensively. We regret that we did not perceive this as a strategy to ensnare us and to try to undermine the causes Noam stands for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had lunch, at Epstein’s ranch, once, in connection with a professional event; we attended dinners at his townhouse in Manhattan and stayed a few times in an apartment he offered when we visited New York City. We also visited Epstein’s Paris apartment one afternoon for the occasion of a work trip. In all cases, these visits were related to Noam’s professional commitments. We never went to his island or knew about anything that happened there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We attended social meetings, lunches, and dinners where Epstein was present and academic matters were discussed. We never witnessed any inappropriate, criminal, or reproachable behavior from Epstein or others. At no time did we see children or underage individuals present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epstein proposed meetings between Noam and figures that Noam had interest in, due to their different perspectives on themes related to Noam’s work and thought. It was in this academic context that Noam wrote a letter of recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noam’s email to Epstein, in which Epstein sought advice about the press, should be read in context. Epstein had claimed to Noam that he [Epstein] was being unfairly persecuted, and Noam spoke from his own experience in political controversies with the media. Epstein created a manipulative narrative about his case, which Noam, in good faith, believed in. It is now clear that it was all orchestrated, having as, at least, one of Epstein’s intentions to try to have someone like Noam repairing Epstein’s reputation by association.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noam’s criticism was never directed at the women’s movement; on the contrary, he has always supported gender equity and women’s rights. What happened was that Epstein took advantage of Noam’s public criticism towards what came to be known as “cancel culture” to present himself as a victim of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only after Epstein’s second arrest in [July] 2019 did we learn the full extent and gravity of what were then accusations—and are now confirmed—heinous crimes against women and children. We were careless in not thoroughly researching his background. This was a grave mistake, and for that lapse in judgment, I apologize on behalf of both of us. Noam shared with me, before his stroke, that he felt the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Noam’s initial public response to inquiries about Epstein failed to adequately acknowledge the gravity of Epstein’s crimes and the enduring pain of his victims, primarily because Noam took it as obvious that he condemned such crimes. However, a firm and explicit stance on such matters is always required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was deeply disturbing for both of us to realize we had engaged with someone who presented as a helpful friend but led a hidden life of criminal, inhumane, and perverted acts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the revelation of the extent of his crimes, we have been shocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to clarify the check: Epstein asked Noam to develop a linguistic challenge that Epstein wished to establish as a regular prize. Noam worked on it, and Epstein sent a check for US$20,000 as payment. Epstein’s office contacted me to arrange for the check to be sent to our home address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding the reported transfer of approximately $270,000, I must clarify that these were entirely Noam’s own funds. At the time, Noam had identified inconsistencies in his retirement resources that threatened his economic independence and caused him great distress. Epstein offered technical assistance to resolve this specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this matter, Epstein acted accordingly, recovering the funds for Noam, in a display of help and very likely as part of a machination to gain greater access to Noam. Epstein acted solely as a financial advisor for this specific matter. To the best of my knowledge, Epstein never had access to our bank or investment accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also important to clarify that Noam and I never had any investments with Epstein or his office—individually or as a couple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope this retrospectively clarifies and explains Noam Chomsky’s interactions with Epstein. Noam and I recognize the gravity of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes and the profound suffering of his victims. Nothing in this statement is intended to minimize that suffering, and we express our unrestricted solidarity with the victims.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mathematics predicts market crashes, power grid blackouts, cardiac failures, and ecosystem collapse. At least six scientific fields discovered it independently. Most didn't know about each other. It took nine decades for anyone to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It predicts tipping points — moments when small changes cause huge effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A match starting a forest fire. A traffic jam forming out of nothing on a clear highway. A single tripped relay cascading into a regional blackout. A healthy heartbeat suddenly becoming erratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mathematics that predicts all of these is the same mathematics. Physicists, biologists, financial analysts, and engineers each invented their own version — under different names, in different journals, without knowing the others existed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1935 and 2025, researchers in at least six fields independently developed mathematical tools for detecting when complex systems are about to undergo dramatic change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each field published in its own journals, invented its own terminology, and cited its own literature. Cross-domain awareness was minimal until after 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cardiologist in 1996 could have used techniques a physicist published in 1971 — but would have needed to read statistical mechanics journals, recognize the connection through completely different notation, and translate the methods to biological data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this rarely happened. The same tools were reinvented, published in domain-specific journals, and locked behind separate paywalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost was real: redundant research, delayed medical tools, and infrastructure vulnerabilities that could have been addressed sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this fragmentation entirely natural — an inevitable consequence of disciplinary specialization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or did structural incentives actively maintain it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question remains open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full analysis is documented in a paper on arXiv, endorsed by Didier Sornette (ETH Zurich).&lt;/p&gt;Read the full paper on arXiv — "Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis"&lt;p&gt;If you're short on time, start with Appendix B — the plain-language summary. You don't need the technical sections to understand what was found and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math works. It predicts market crashes, detects cardiac dysfunction, identifies when ecosystems are about to collapse, and warns of cascading infrastructure failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It applies to any interconnected system. It is fundamental — discoverable from first principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this actually new?&lt;lb/&gt;The individual discoveries are known. What's new is documenting the full convergence pattern — classifying each instance by type and providing citation network evidence that these fields remained siloed for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is this different from Sornette (2004)?&lt;lb/&gt;Sornette's textbook is the most important prior synthesis — we cite it extensively. Our contribution adds a discovery classification taxonomy and quantitative citation analysis showing parallel development continued even after his synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why arXiv and not a journal?&lt;lb/&gt;arXiv is how physics papers reach the community. The paper is endorsed by Didier Sornette of ETH Zurich. Journal review is a separate, longer process — arXiv makes the work immediately accessible, consistent with our argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the conflict of interest?&lt;lb/&gt;Fully disclosed. The authors developed a framework (Appendix A) classified as "unvalidated candidate" because of the dual role. The convergence pattern in the main paper stands on six to nine other discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B.A. Physics, Reed College | Former CTO (6x) | Independent Researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paper endorsed by Didier Sornette (ETH Zurich), author of Critical Phenomena in Natural Sciences — the leading cross-domain synthesis in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;energyscholar@gmail.com | (541) 250-0662&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;linkedin.com/in/stephensonbruce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available for interviews — on record, on background, or deep technical walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;
