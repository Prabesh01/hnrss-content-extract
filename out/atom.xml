    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bytes before FLOPS: your algorithm is (mostly) fine, your data isn't&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small, but deep dive into performance and data-oriented optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Foreword&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, earlier this year I did a presentation at a cool(get it?) little Norwegian company called Airthings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a two-parter. First part was how the compilation pipeline works - from ASCII to assembly, greatly simplified of course. It was from an old presentation I did many years ago. The second part is the interesting. It's about performance and what are some of the low-hanging fruits that you can pick off to speed up stuff as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that part actually takes a while, but in short it's basically a distillation of my experience working on compilers, assembly and writing vectorized code. The gist of it is - data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that a small summary would make a good blog post. There's plenty of material on data-oriented design and performance, but this might be a nice overview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll style it as a written representation of how I approach optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I approach an optimization effort, first thing I do is I try to visualize the data, where each bit is going from and to, what operations are being done, what's the difference between the initial and final state, can we get there with fewer or simpler steps?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the data is coming in in a suboptimal form, transform it.&lt;lb/&gt; There is no algorithm in the world that will save you from inefficiently coded information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually the steps, in my experience, go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Profile&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before anything else, profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can intuit where the bottleneck is, but most of the time, you would be surprised at the real place the algorithm falls apart. Sometimes it won't be a single bottleneck, maybe it'll be spread out over multiple places (worst case scenario being the flat profile where program time is roughly evenly distributed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of it depends on not only understanding low-level programming but the domain that you're working with.&lt;lb/&gt; There's only so much you can optimize without enough information on what that specific algorithm/code/subsystem is supposed to be doing, rather than what it is actually (slowly) doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, once the lowest-hanging fruit has been picked, we're not talking just function, but instruction-level profiling as well where, depending on the machine, you can be frontend-bound, backend-bound, memory-bound... a whole new world opens up.&lt;lb/&gt; See VTune metrics and analysis guides, lots of useful stuff in there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Specialize the algorithm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This step is not directly related to data, but changing data often requires changing the algorithm. Not only do we need to change access patterns and the shape of the data, but often a different algorithm more suited to the new form of data we're processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, this is a crucial part as this is where you identify one of the most important parts of optimization - "do less". Usually when we implement algorithms, we just try to make them work, aka. the "make it work-&amp;gt;make it fast-&amp;gt;make it beautiful" paradigm. In the process of development we change the data, the algorithm, the code goes through many iterations, a lot is left on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specializing an algorithm means taking away the genericity and only leaving in the parts that are relevant to the data being processed. If it means specializing the data, then that's fair game as well, garbage in/garbage out. As part of development we tend to use existing algorithms, whether it is from a standard library or an external one, or even just different module in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These existing algorithms are by definition not bespoke and don't take into account the data or the manipulation done on it. In many cases you can rewrite them to suit your use-case, in others you can simply use a more specific algorithm, e.g. &lt;code&gt;radixsort&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;quicksort&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are often afraid of peeking into the libraries, thinking it's magic. It's not, just look at the code, learn what's being used and adapt it to your own case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specific example given in the presentation was specializing a generic image downscaling algorithm to specifically handle integer-based, 32bit argb images, which was used to great effect. Sped up the implementation as well as allowed for further optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small and (very) trivial example would be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// we're trying to parse a validated, 2-digit, positive integer

// the generic way (atoi)
// overhead: function call, loop setup, branch prediction, locale checks.
int val = atoi(ptr);

// the specialized way
// overhead: none really, just a few instructions that the CPU can blaze through
int val = (ptr[0] - '0') * 10 + (ptr[1] - '0');
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Make it cache friendly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where the meat of the matter is. Think about the data writes and reads, both on temporal and spatial axes. Every load and store needs to be accounted for and studied. Is it needed, where does it write, when should it write, are there any similarly pointed writes/reads? Similarly for reads, consider not just the location in the code, but the memory location it concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To put it plainly, try to access data that's either close to data you've already accessed or data that you've recently accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your algorithm is just accessing a part of your data, e.g. you have an array of structs and you're only accessing the first 8 bytes of a 128 byte struct, you're wasting a lot of cpu. Separate out the relevant data and process it independently. The relevant data stays hot in cache and you reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One nice trick is if you're writing to a location that you know you won't access soon, you can use streaming non-temporal writes/stores (&lt;code&gt;_mm_stream_XX&lt;/code&gt; intrinsics in x86).
Using them allows the CPU to bypass the data caches and speed up the whole process. Useful for constricted memory bandwidth as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you've done all that (or ideally before, premature optimization is not a thing here in this blog. Improperly granulated optimization on the other hand, is), you can see what the actual values will be for each piece of data and compress the types if possible. Saves space, you can keep more data in cache and thus speed up the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structure padding can also be a significant factor. Take a look at this example, generated by a very useful tool called &lt;code&gt;pahole&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct bad_order {
	char                       c;                    /*     0     1 */

	/* XXX 7 bytes hole, try to pack */

	double                     d;                    /*     8     8 */
	int                        i;                    /*    16     4 */

	/* size: 24, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
	/* sum members: 13, holes: 1, sum holes: 7 */
	/* padding: 4 */
	/* last cacheline: 24 bytes */
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct good_order {
	double                     d;                    /*     0     8 */
	int                        i;                    /*     8     4 */
	char                       c;                    /*    12     1 */

	/* size: 16, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
	/* padding: 3 */
	/* last cacheline: 16 bytes */
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As seen above, even though &lt;code&gt;bad_order&lt;/code&gt; has the same members as &lt;code&gt;good_order&lt;/code&gt;, it is 8 bytes larger simply due to the ordering of members.&lt;lb/&gt; In practice, on x86-64, this means that you can fit 4 &lt;code&gt;good_order&lt;/code&gt; structs in a 64bit cache line, whereas you can fit only 2 &lt;code&gt;bad_order&lt;/code&gt; structs (with one spilling over).&lt;lb/&gt; Which is a bit bonkers if you think about it, simply reordering a few lines in an editor can take off a good chunk of a runtime (depending on the algorithm of course).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;__attribute__((packed))&lt;/code&gt; instead of manually reordering members, but I'd only use it for protocol/storage use as unaligned members can cause issues on some architectures, so just one more thing to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, if you're in a loop where you know exactly which next addresses you're going to access (provided it's not a simple strided memory access pattern), you can use software prefetching instructions (&lt;code&gt;__builtin_prefetch&lt;/code&gt; intrinsic in x86). But again, unless it's a highly unpredictable (for the pretty good hardware prefetchers of the modern CPUs), you should just trust the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Make it SIMD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vectorizing an algorithm can in some simpler cases come as a result of the step above, as the result is usually a serial processing of data, which is highly amenable to vectorization (and parallelization). In that case, simply grouping the data in 8/16/32 wide groups and using vector instructions to process them can be enough.&lt;lb/&gt; In those cases, what can also happen as well is autovectorization, where the compiler will happily recognize that a loop vectorizable and do the whole process for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other cases, you have to take a good hard look at what your algorithm is doing, separate out independent streams of data processing, rearrange the data to fit the vectorized version so it's laid out nicely and contiguously for the SIMD instructions to speed through, and try to vectorize the whole loop(s). If you have some complex data movement going on, it can be a challenge to shuffle and permute all the bytes around, but a fun challenge nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing to be aware of is that not all instruction sets are available on all CPUs microarchitectures (looking at you Intel with AVX512) and thus code that you write can just segfault on some machines. To avoid it, just simply branch based on the CPU feature set with a common fallback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For autovectorization, you can use function multiversioning which automatically does all that for you. It makes multiple copies of a function for each target and branches on each call, very nifty.&lt;lb/&gt; Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;__attribute__((target_clones("avx512f", "avx2", "default")))
void process_data(float* data, int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; count; ++i) {
        data[i] = data[i] * 0.5f;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information on this (and data-oriented design in general), research SoA(structures of arrays) and AoSoA (arrays of structures of arrays). This could honestly be a whole series of blog posts, so just for the sake of terseness, take a look at the materials section at the bottom for sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Make it parallel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now, parallelization at this stage should come at no cost, you've already separated out the data processing in independent streams, parallelizing should be just a matter of using &lt;code&gt;OpenMP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rayon&lt;/code&gt; in case of C/C++ and Rust. Combined with the above steps, this should easily net you two orders of magnitude worth of speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing you should be aware of however, is false sharing.&lt;lb/&gt; In short, if you have multiple threads accessing a single cache line, it'll trigger a memory stall and a load from RAM.&lt;lb/&gt; Ironically, it can be fixed by adding padding, which makes less data fit in the cache, but enables the parallelization to do its thing. Thus a net positive. Small example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct packed {
    std::atomic&amp;lt;int64_t&amp;gt; a;
    std::atomic&amp;lt;int64_t&amp;gt; b; 
};

struct padded {
    std::atomic&amp;lt;int64_t&amp;gt; a;
    // force "b" onto a new cache line
    alignas(64) std::atomic&amp;lt;int64_t&amp;gt; b; 
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;packed&lt;/code&gt; struct, both members fit in a single cache line and will therefore exhibit false sharing in a multithreaded scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is more or less it. Note that this list is not applicable in every case (how on earth would you parallelize an interpreter) nor does it have every optimization worth doing (rewriting a subroutine in assembly for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should cover most of it though as, with programming, all we're doing is shuffling data from end to the other with some transformation in between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How do GC/scripting languages fit in?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short answer - they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long answer - it depends. It depends on the language and its support for value types and the ability to control the data layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Java has Project Valhalla, which is an unreleased experimental project to add value types to Java.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Go is solid all-around, but writing vectorized code often (ideally) requires writing go assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Python defers any perf-related code to C/C++.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lua similarly should not be used to implement perf-sensitive parts of a program, which its embeddable nature supports quite naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;C# has an awesome situation in here with its support for value types (ref structs), slices (spans), stack allocation, SIMD intrinsics (including AVX512!). You can even go bare-metal and GC-free with bflat.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the outliers, if you truly have non-IO-bottlenecked, data-intensive code that needs to run as fast as possible, systems languages like C/C++/Rust are your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Useful tools &amp;amp; material&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hyperfine - benchmarking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;perf - profiling (ETW for windows)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VTune - in-depth profiling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DTrace - profiling, debugging, tracing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cachegrind - cache tracing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perfetto - tracing visualization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;godbolt.org - a fantastic website where you can see in-detail how you code gets compiled down to assembly (plus analysis and various tools)&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Fifty Shades of OOP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OOP-bashing seems fashionable nowadays. I decided to write this article after seeing two OOP-related articles on Lobsters in quick succession. I’m not interested in defending or attacking OOP, but I do want to throw in my two cents and offer a more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry and the academy have used the term “object-oriented” to mean so many different things. One thing that makes conversations around OOP so unproductive is the lack of consensus on what OOP is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is Object-Oriented Programming? Wikipedia defines it as “a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.” This definition is unsatisfactory, as it requires a definition of an “object” and fails to encompass the disparate ways the term is used in the industry. There is also Alan Kay’s vision of OOP. However, the way most people use the term has drifted apart, and I don’t want to fall into essentialism or etymological fallacy by insisting on a “true” meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I think it is better to treat OOP as a mixed bag of interrelated ideas and examine them individually. Below, I will survey some ideas related to OOP and mention their pros and cons (in my subjective mind).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Classes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Object-oriented programming is a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships. — Grady Booch&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classes extend the idea of a “struct” or “record” with support for the method syntax, information hiding, and inheritance. We will talk about those specific features later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classes can also be viewed as blueprints for objects. It is not the only way to do that, and prototypes is an alternative pioneered by Self and, most famously, used by JavaScript. Personally, I feel that prototypes are harder to wrap one’s head around compared to classes. Even JavaScript tries to hide its usage of prototypes from newcomers with ES6 classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Method Syntax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In Japanese, we have sentence chaining, which is similar to method chaining in Ruby — Yukihiro Matsumoto&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The method syntax is one of the less controversial OOP features. It captures common programming use cases involving operations on a specific subject. Even in languages without methods, it is common to see functions effectively serve as methods by taking the relevant data as their first argument (or last, in languages with currying).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The syntax involves method definitions and method calls. Usually, languages supporting methods have both, unless you consider the “pipe operators” in functional languages as a form of method call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The method call syntax aids IDE autocompletion, and method chaining is often more ergonomic than nested function calls (similar to the pipe operator in functional languages).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some debatable aspects of the method syntax, too. First, in many languages, methods are often not definable outside of a class, which causes a power imbalance compared to functions. There are certain exceptions, such as Rust (methods are always defined outside of the struct), Scala, Kotlin, and C# (extension methods).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, in many languages, &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; is implicit. This keeps the code more concise, but it can also introduce confusion and increase the risk of accidental name shadowing. Another drawback of an implicit this is that it is always passed as a pointer, and its type cannot be changed. This means you cannot pass it as a copy, and sometimes this indirection leads to performance issues. More importantly, because the type of this is fixed, you cannot write generic functions that accept different &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; types. Python and Rust got this right from the start, and C++ just fixed this issue in C++23 with deducing this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, in languages with both “free functions” and methods, they become two incompatible ways to do the same thing. This can cause problems in generic code. Rust addresses this issue by allowing fully qualifying a method name and treating it as a function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, the dot notation is used for both instance variable accesses and method calls in most languages. This is an intentional choice to make methods look more uniform with objects. In certain dynamically typed languages where methods are instance variables, this is fine and pretty much not even a choice. On the other hand, in languages like C++ or Java, this can cause confusion and shadowing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Information Hiding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Its interface or definition was chosen to reveal as little as possible about its inner workings — [Parnas, 1972b]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Smalltalk, all instance variables are not directly accessible from outside the object, and all methods are exposed. More modern OOP languages support information hiding via access specifiers like &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; at the class level. Even non-OOP languages usually support information hiding in some way, be it module systems, opaque types, or even C’s header separation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information hiding is a good way to prevent invariant from being violated. It is also a good way to separate frequently changed implementation details from a stable interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, aggressively hiding information may cause unnecessary boilerplate or abstraction inversion. Another criticism comes from functional programmers, who argue that you don’t need to maintain invariants and thus don’t need much information hiding if data is immutable. And, in a sense, OOP encourages people to write mutable objects that must be maintained as invariants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information hiding also encourages people to create small, self-contained objects that “know how to handle themselves,” which leads directly into the topic of encapsulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Encapsulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you can, just move all of that behavior into the class it helps. After all, OOP is about letting objects take care of themselves. — Bob Nystrom, Game Programming Patterns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encapsulation is often confused with information hiding, but the two are distinct. Encapsulation refers to bundling data with the functions that operate on it. OOP languages directly support encapsulation with classes and the method syntax, but there are other approaches (e.g., the module system in OCaml).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common construct for encapsulation is objects, but it is not the only mechanism. Many modern languages also support closures (in fact, closures and objects can simulate each other). There are also other lesser-known approaches, such as modules found in the ML family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data-oriented design has a lot to say about bundling data and functionality. When many objects exist, it is often much more efficient to process them in batches rather than individually. Having small objects with distinct behaviors can lead to poor data locality, more indirection, and fewer opportunities for parallelism. Of course, advocates of data-oriented design don’t reject encapsulation outright, but they encourage a more coarse-grained form of it, organized around how the code is actually used rather than how the domain model is conceptually structured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Interfaces&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“No part of a complex system should depend on the internal details of any other part.” — Daniel, Ingalls. “The Smalltalk-76 Programming System Design and Implementation”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separation of interface and implementation is an old idea closely related to information hiding, encapsulation, and abstract data type. In some sense, even C’s header files can be considered an interface, but OOP usage of “interface” most often refers to a specific set of language constructs that support polymorphism (typically implemented via inheritance). Usually, an interface can’t contain data, and in more restricted languages (e.g., early versions of Java), they can’t contain method implementations either. The same idea of an interface is also common in non-OOP languages: Haskell type classes, Rust traits, and Go interfaces all serve the role of specifying an abstract set of operations independent of implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interface is often considered a simpler, more disciplined alternative to full-blown class inheritance. It is a single-purpose feature and doesn’t suffer from the same diamond problem that plagues multiple inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interface is also extremely useful in combination with parametric polymorphism, since it allows you to constrain the operations a type parameter must support. Dynamically-typed languages (and C++/D template) achieve something similar through duck-typing, but even languages with duck-typing introduce interface constructs later to express constraints more explicitly (e.g., C++ concepts or TypeScript interfaces).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interface as implemented in OOP languages often has a runtime cost, but that’s not always the case. For example, C++ concepts is an example that only supports compile-time, and Rust’s trait only has opt-in runtime polymorphism support via &lt;code&gt;dyn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Late Binding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things — Alan Kay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Late binding refers to delaying the lookup of a method or a member until runtime. It is the default of most dynamic-typed languages, where method calls are often implemented as a hash table lookup, but can also be achieved with other means, such as dynamic loading or function pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key aspect of late binding is that behaviour can be changed while the software is still running, enabling all kinds of hot-reloading and monkey-patching workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The downside of late binding is its non-trivial performance cost. Moreover, it can also be a footgun for breaking invariants or even interface mismatches. Its mutable nature can also introduce subtler issues, for example, the “late binding closures” pitfall in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dynamic Dispatch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A programming paradigm in C++ using Polymorphism based on runtime function dispatch using virtual functions — Back to Basics: Object-Oriented Programming - Jon Kalb - CppCon 2019&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A concept related to late binding is dynamic dispatch, in which the implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at runtime. The two concepts overlap, though dynamic dispatch focuses more on selecting multiple known polymorphic operations rather than on name lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a dynamically typed language, dynamic dispatch is the default since everything is late-bound. In statically typed languages, it is usually implemented as a virtual function table that looks something like this under the hood:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These languages also provide compile-time guarantees that the vtable contains valid operations for the type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamic dispatch can be decoupled from inheritance, whether by manually implementing a v-table (e.g., C++‘s “type-erased types” such as &lt;code&gt;std::function&lt;/code&gt;) or an interface/trait/typeclass kind of constructs. When not paired with inheritance, dynamic dispatch alone is usually not considered “OOP.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is that the pointer to the v-table can be directly inside the object (e.g., C++) or embedded in “fat pointers” (e.g., Go and Rust).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complaints about dynamic dispatch are usually about its performance. Although a virtual function call itself can be pretty fast, it opens room for missing compiler inlining opportunities, cache misses, and branch mispredictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inheritance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;programming using class hierarchies and virtual functions to allow manipulation of objects of a variety of types through well-defined interfaces and to allow a program to be extended incrementally through derivation — Bjarne Stroustrup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inheritance has a long history, way backed to Simula 67. It is probably the most iconic feature of OOP. Almost every language marketed as “object-oriented” includes it, while languages that avoid OOP typically omit it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be damn convenient. In many cases, using an alternative approach will result in significantly more boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, inheritance is a very non-orthogonal feature. It is a single mechanism that enables dynamic dispatch, subtyping polymorphism, interface/implementation segregation, and code reuse. It is flexible, though that flexibility makes it easy to misuse. For that reason, some languages nowadays replace it with more restrictive alternative constructs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some other problems with inheritance. First, using inheritance almost certainly means you are paying the performance cost of dynamic dispatch and heap allocation. In some languages, such as C++, you can use inheritance without dynamic dispatch and heap allocation, and there are some valid use cases (e.g., code reuse with CRTP), but the majority of uses of inheritance are for runtime polymorphism (and thus rely on dynamic dispatch).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, inheritance implements subtyping in an unsound way, requiring programmers to manually enforce the Liskov substitution principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, inheritance hierarchies are rigid. They suffer from issues like the diagonal problem, and that inflexibility is one of the main reasons people prefer composition over inheritance. The component pattern chapter of Game Programming Patterns provides a good example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Subtyping Polymorphism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If for each object&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;of type&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;there is another object&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;of type&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;such that for all programs&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;defined in terms of&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;, the behavior of&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;is unchanged when&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;is substituted for&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;, then&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;is a subtype of&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
      &lt;mjx-container&gt;. — Barbara Liskov, “Data Abstraction and Hierarchy”&lt;/mjx-container&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subtyping describes an “is a” relation between two types. The Liskov substitution principle defines the property that safe subtyping relationships must uphold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OOP languages often support subtyping via inheritance, but note that inheritance doesn’t always model subtyping, and it is not the only form of subtyping either. Various interface/trait constructs in non-OOP languages often support subtyping. And besides nominal subtyping, where one explicitly declares the subtyping relationship, there are also structural subtyping, where the subtyping is implicit if one type contains all the features of another type. Good examples of structural subtyping include OCaml (objects and polymorphic variants) and TypeScript interfaces. Subtyping also shows in all kinds of little places, such as Rust lifetime and TypeScript’s coercion from a non-nullable type to its nullable counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A related concept to subtyping is variance (not related to class-invariant), which bridges parametric polymorphism and subtyping. I won’t bother explaining variance here, as this topic probably needs an entire blog post to explain well. It is a great ergonomic boost (e.g., C++ pointers will be unusable for polymorphic use if they are not covariant), but most languages only implement a limited, hard-coded version, because it is hard to understand and also error-prone. In particular, mutable data types should usually be invariant, and Java/C#‘s covariant arrays are a primary example on this gone wrong. Only a few languages allow programmers to explicitly control variance, including Scala and Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type conversion via subtyping relationships is often implicit. Implicit conversion has a bad reputation. Though doing it with subtyping is ergonomic, and is probably the least surprising kind of implicit conversion. Another way to view subtyping is as the dual of implicit conversions. We can “fake” a subtyping relation with implicit conversion. For example, C++ templated types are invariant, but &lt;code&gt;std::unique_ptr&lt;/code&gt; achieves covariance with an implicit conversion from &lt;code&gt;std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;Derived&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;Base&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Does Go Have Subtyping? is a good article to further explore this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason that language designers often try to avoid subtyping is the implementation complexity. Integrating bidirectional type inference and subtyping is notoriously difficult. Stephen Dolan’s 2016 thesis Algebraic Subtyping makes good progress addressing this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Message Passing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages — Alan Kay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Message passing means using objects that send each other “messages” as a way of execution. It is the centric theme of Alan Kay’s vision of OOP, though the definition can be pretty vague. An important point is that message names are late-bound, and the structures of these messages are not necessarily fixed at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many early object-oriented concepts were influenced by distributed and simulation systems, where message passing is natural. However, in the era where most people work on single-threaded code, the message was gradually forgotten in languages such as C++ and Java. The method syntax only has limited benefit compared to the original message-passing idea (Bjarne Stroustrup was definitely aware of the idea from Simula, but there is practical constraint on how to make it fast). There was still some genuine message passing, but only in specific areas such as inter-process communication or highly event-driven systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Message passing gains a Renaissance in concurrent programming, ironically through non-OOP languages like Erlang and Golang, with constructs such as actors and channels. This kind of shared-nothing concurrency removed a whole range of data race and race condition bugs. In combination with supervision, actors also provide fault tolerance, so that the failure of one actor will not affect the entire program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Recursion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In general, a rule of thumb is: use classes and objects in situations where open recursion is a big win. — Real World OCaml&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originating in the famous Types and Programming Languages, open recursion is probably the least well-known and understood term in this blog post. Nevertheless, it just describes a familiar property of object-oriented systems: methods for an object can call each other, even if they are defined in different classes in the inheritance hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term is somewhat misleading, as there may not be recursive function calls, but here “recursion” means “mutually recursive.” The word “open” refers to “open to extension,” typically empowered by inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easiest to see with an example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For anyone with some familiarity with OOP, we probably take open recursion for granted, even though we may not be aware of its name. However, not all language constructs have this property. For example, in many languages, functions are not mutually recursive by default:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, in languages with late-bound functions, functions in the same module can always call each other (e.g., Python, JavaScript). There are other languages where functions are mutually recursive by default (e.g., Rust), or have forward declarations (C) or a &lt;code&gt;letrec&lt;/code&gt; construct (Scheme and ML family) to make functions mutually recursive. This solves the “recursion” part, but still not the “open” part yet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s fix this problem by using a callback:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tada, we just reinvented prototype-style dispatch!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, with my quick example above, I want to show that open recursion is a property that OOP gives for free, but reproducing it in languages without built-in support can be tricky. Open recursion allows interdependent parts of an object to be defined separately, and this property is used in many instances, for example, the entire idea of decorator pattern depends on open recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OOP Best Practices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the more common complaints about OOP are not about specific language features, but rather about the programming styles it encourages. Many practices are taught as universal best practices, sometimes with rationales, but their downsides are often omitted. Some examples popped into my mind are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Practice&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Advantages&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;preferring polymorphism over tagged union/if/switch/pattern matching&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Open to extension, easier to add new cases.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Performance hit; Related behaviors get scattered in multiple places; harder to see the whole controll flow in one place&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;making all data members private&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Protect class invariants&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;More boilerplates; Often unnecessary to hide data without invariants; Getter/setter pairs work less well compared to direct access in languages without property syntax&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;preferring small “self-managed” objects over central “managers”&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Harder to violate invariants, cleaner code organization&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Potential bad data locality, missing parallelism opportunities, and duplicated references to common data (“back pointer”)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;preferring extension rather than modification&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Prevent new features from breaking the old one. Prevent API break&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;No reason to “close” a non-public module where you own its usage. Leads to unnecessary complexity and inheritance chain; poorly designed interfaces are not changed; Can cause abstraction inversion&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;preferring abstraction over concrete implementations&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Making more system swappable and testable&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Overuse sacrifices readability and debuggability. Performance cost of extra indirection&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post is long enough, so I will not go into more details. Feel free to disagree with my “advantages and disadvantages”. What I want to convey is that almost all those practices come with trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;In the End&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations on making it to the end of this article! There are other topics I’d love to discuss, such as RAII and design patterns. However, this article is long enough, so I will leave those for you to explore on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Normal practice in deploying post-quantum cryptography is to deploy ECC+PQ. IETF's TLS working group is standardizing ECC+PQ. But IETF management is also non-consensually ramming a particular NSA-driven document through the IETF process, a "non-hybrid" document that adds just PQ as another TLS option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't worry: we're standardizing cars with seatbelts. Also, recognizing generous funding from the National Morgue Association, we're going to standardize cars without seatbelts as another option, ignoring the safety objections. That's okay, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last month I posted part 1 of this story. Today's part 2 highlighted the corruption. This blog post, part 3, highlights the dodging in a particular posting at the beginning of this month by an IETF "security area director". Part 4 will give an example of how dissent on this topic has been censored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consensus means whatever the people in power want to do. Recall from my previous blog post that "adoption" of a document is a preliminary step before an IETF "working group" works on, and decides whether to standardize, the document. In April 2025, the chairs of the IETF TLS WG called for "adoption" of this NSA-driven document. During the call period, 20 people expressed unequivocal support for adoption, 2 people expressed conditional support for adoption, and 7 people expressed unequivocal opposition to adoption. (Details for verification.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chairs claimed that "we have consensus to adopt this draft". I promptly asked for explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the chairs could even reply, an "area director" interrupted, claiming, inter alia, the following: "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ... The vast majority was in favour of adoption ... There were a few dissenting opinions".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After these lies by the "area director" were debunked, the chairs said that they had declared consensus "because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft" specifically "enough people willing to review the draft".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can understand not everybody being familiar with the specific definition of "consensus" that antitrust law requires standards-development organizations to follow. But it's astonishing to see chairs substituting a consensus-evaluation procedure that simply ignores objections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stonewalling. The chairs said I could escalate. IETF procedures say that an unresolved dispute can be brought "to the attention of the Area Director(s) for the area in which the Working Group is chartered", and then "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I filed a complaint with the "security area directors" in early June 2025. One of them never replied. The other, the same one who had claimed that there was "clearly consensus", sent a series of excuses for not handling the complaint. For example, one excuse was that the PDF format "discourages participation".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do IETF procedures say "The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute unless the dispute is documented in a PDF"? No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent email two days later systematically addressing the excuses. The "area director" never replied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It isn't clear under IETF procedures whether a non-reply allows an appeal. It is, however, clear that an appeal can't be filed after two months. I escalated to the "Internet Engineering Steering Group" (IESG) in August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(These aren't even marginally independent groups. The "area directors" are the IESG members. IESG appoints the WG chairs.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IESG didn't reply until October 2025. It rejected one of the "Area Director" excuses for having ignored my complaint, but endorsed another excuse. I promptly filed a revised complaint with the "area director", jumping through the hoops that IESG had set. There were then further runarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The switch. Suddenly, on 1 November 2025, IESG publicly instructed the "area director" to address the following question: "Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "area director" posted his conclusion mere hours later: "I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dodging procedural objections. Before looking at how the "area director" argued for this conclusion, I'd like to emphasize three things that the "area director" didn't do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, did the "area director" address my complaint about the chair action on this topic? No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason this matters is that the law requires standards-development organizations to provide an "appeals process". Structurally, the "area director" isn't quoting and answering the points in my complaint; the "area director" puts the entire burden on the reader to try to figure out what's supposedly answering what, and to realize that many points remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, did the "area director" address the chairs claiming that "we have consensus to adopt this draft"? Or the previous claim from the "area director" that there was "clearly consensus"? No. Instead IESG and this "area director" quietly shifted from "consensus" to "rough consensus". (Did you notice this shift when I quoted IESG's "rough consensus" instruction?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason this matters is that "consensus" is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations. The law doesn't allow "rough consensus". Also, IETF claims that "decision-making requires achieving broad consensus". "broad consensus" is even stronger than "consensus", since it's saying that there's consensus in a broad group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the way that my complaint had established the lack of consensus was, first, by reviewing the general definition of "consensus" (which I paraphrased from the definition in the law, omitting a citation only because the TLS chairs had threatened me with a list ban if I mentioned the law again), and then applying the components of that definition to the situation at hand. Did the area director follow this structure? Here's the definition of "consensus", or "rough consensus" if we're switching to that, and now let's apply that definition? No. Nobody reading this message from the "area director" can figure out what the "area director" believes these words mean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow, look at that: "due process" is another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations. Part of due process is simply making clear what procedures are being applied. Could it possibly be that the people writing the law were thinking through how standardization processes could be abused?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Numbers. Without further ado, let's look at what the "security area director" did write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The IESG has requested that I evaluate the WG Adoption call results for ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3 (draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement). Please see below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted above, IESG had instructed the "area director" to answer the following question: "Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the TLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Side note: Given that the "area director" posted all of the following on the same day that IESG instructed the "area director" to write this, presumably this was all written in advance and coordinated with the rest of IESG. I guess the real point of finally (on 1 November 2025) addressing the adoption decision (from 15 April 2025) was to try to provide cover for the "last call" a few days later (5 November 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ExecSum&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted above, the TLS WG chairs had claimed "consensus", and the "area director" had claimed that there was "clearly consensus". The "area director" is now quietly shifting to a weaker claim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Timeline&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;April 1: Sean and Joe announce WG Adoption Call [ about 40 messages sent in the thread ]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"About 40"? What happened to the "area director" previously writing "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call"? And why is the number of messages supposed to matter in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;April 15: Sean announces the Adoption Call passed. [ another 50 messages are sent in the thread ]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Messages after the specified adoption-call deadline can't justify the claim that "the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document". The adoption call failed to reach consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;April 18 to today: A chain of (attempted) Appeals by D. J. Bernstein to the AD(s), IESG and IAB, parts of which are still in process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the ADs and IESG stonewalled in response to complaints doesn't mean that they were "attempted" complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Outcome&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;30 people participated in the consensus call, 23 were in favour of adoption, 6 against and 1 ambivalent (names included at the bottom of this email).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers are much closer to reality than the "area director" previously writing "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ... The vast majority was in favour of adoption ... There were a few dissenting opinions".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, given that the "area director" is continually making claims that aren't true (see examples below) and seems generally allergic to providing evidence (the text I'm quoting below has, amazingly, zero URLs), it's a relief to see the "area director" providing names to back up the claimed numbers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But somehow, even after being caught lying about the numbers before, the "area director" still can't resist shading the numbers a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual numbers were 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption, 2 people conditionally supporting adoption, and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption. Clearly 7 is close to 6, and 20+2 is close to 23, but, hmmm, not exactly. Let's check the details:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the "area director" end up with 6 negative votes rather than 7? By falsely listing Thomas Bellebaum as "ambivalent" and falsely attributing a "prefer not, but okay if we do" position to Bellebaum. In fact, Bellbaum had written "I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids." (This was in reply to Stephen Farrell, who had written "I'm opposed to adoption, at this time.")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the "area director" end up with 23 positive votes rather than 22? By falsely listing the document author (Deirdre Connolly) as having stated a pro-adoption position during the call. The "area director" seems generally clueless about conflict-of-interest issues and probably doesn't find it obvious that an author shouldn't vote, but the simple fact is that the author didn't vote. She sent three messages during the call period; all of those messages are merely commenting on specific points, not casting a vote on the adoption question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The document author didn't object to the "area director" fudging the numbers. Bellebaum did politely object; the "area director" didn't argue, beyond trying to save face with comments such as "Thanks for the clarification".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More to the point, the "area director" has never explained whether or how the tallies of positive and negative votes are supposed to be relevant to the "rough consensus" claim. The "area director" also hasn't commented on IETF saying that IETF doesn't make decisions by voting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bogus arguments for the draft. I mentioned in my previous blog post that IETF claims that "IETF participants use their best engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole Internet, not just the best solution for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In favour argument summary&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While there is a lack of substantiating why adoption is desired - which is typical&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, the "area director" seems to have some basic awareness that this document flunks the "engineering judgment" criterion. The "area director" tries to defend this by saying that other documents flunk too. So confidence-inspiring!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- the big use case seems to be to support those parties relying on NIST and FIPS for their security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wrong. Anything+PQ, and in particular ECC+PQ, complies with NIST's standards when the PQ part does. See NIST SP 800-227: "This publication approves the use of the key combiner (14) for any t &amp;gt; 1 if at least one shared secret (i.e., Sj for some j) is generated from the key-establishment methods in SP 800-56A [1] or SP 800-56B [2] or an approved KEM." For example, if the PQ part is ML-KEM as per FIPS 203, then NIST allows ECC+PQ too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's next: claiming that using PQ in an Internet protocol would violate NIST standards unless NIST has standardized that particular Internet protocol?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This encompasses much more than just the US government as other certification bodies and other national governments have come to rely on the outcome of the NIST competition, which was the only public multi-year post-quantum cryptography effort to evaluate the security of proposed new post-quantum algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won't bother addressing the errors here, since the bottom-line claim is orthogonal to the issue at hand. The TLS WG already has an ECC+PQ document using NIST-approved PQ; the question is whether to also have a document allowing the ECC seatbelt to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It was also argued pure PQ has less complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what would be even less complicated? Encrypting with the null cipher!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a claim that PQ is less complex than ECC+PQ. There was no response to Andrey Jivsov objecting that having a PQ option makes the ecosystem more complicated. The basic error in the PQ-less-complex claim is that it ignores ECC+PQ already being there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How the "area director" described the objections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opposed argument summary&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most of the arguments against adoption are focused on the fact that a failsafe is better than no failsafe, irrespective of which post-quantum algorithm is used,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the closest that the "area director" comes to acknowledging the central security argument for ECC+PQ. Of course, the "area director" spends as little time as possible on security. Compare this to my own objection to adoption, which started with SIKE as a concrete example of the dangers and continued with "SIKE is not an isolated example: https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp shows that 48% of the 69 round-1 submissions to the NIST competition have been broken by now".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;and that the practical costs for hybrids are negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmmm. By listing this as part of an "opposed argument summary", is the "area director" suggesting that this was disputed? When and where was the dispute?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted above, I've seen unquantified NSA/GCHQ fearmongering about costs, but that was outside IETF. If NSA and GCHQ tried the same arguments on a public mailing list then they'd end up being faced with questions that they can't answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It was also argued that having an RFC gives too much promotion or sense of approval to a not recommended algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wrote my own summary of the objections, I provided a quote and link for each point. The "area director" doesn't do this. If the "area director" is accurately presenting an argument that was raised, why not provide a quote and a link? Is the "area director" misrepresenting the argument? Making up a strawman? The reader can't tell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have expanded some of the arguments and my interpretation of the weight of these below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comment about "weight" is revealing. What we'll see again and again is that the "area director" is expressing the weight that he places on each argument (within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"), i.e., the extent to which he is convinced or not convinced by those arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that IESG has power under IETF rules to unilaterally block publications approved by WGs, it's unsurprising that the "area directors", in their roles as IESG members, will end up evaluating the merits of WG-approved documents. But that isn't what this "area director" was instructed to do here. There isn't a WG-approved document at this point. Instead the "area director" was instructed to evaluate whether the chairs "appropriately" called "rough consensus" to "adopt" the document. The "area director" is supposed to be evaluating procedurally what the WG decision-makers did. Instead the "area director" is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Non-hybrid as "basic flaw"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The argument by some opponents that non-hybrids are a "basic flaw" seems to miscategorize what a "basic flaw" is. There is currently no known "basic flaw" against MLKEM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that the "area director" is trying to make some sort of claim here about ML-KEM not having been attacked, but the wording is so unclear as to be unevaluatable. Why doesn't KyberSlash count? How about Clangover? How about the continuing advances in lattice attacks that have already reduced ML-KEM below its claimed security targets, the most recent news being from last month?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, claiming that ML-KEM isn't "known" to have problems is utterly failing to address the point of the ECC seatbelt. It's like saying "This car hasn't crashed, so the absence of seatbelts isn't a basic flaw".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As was raised, it is rather odd to be arguing we must immediately move to use post-quantum algorithms while at the same time argue these might contain fundamental basic flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the "area director" is reasonably capturing a statement from one document proponent (original wording: "I find it to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the quantum threat requires immediate work, and yet we are also somehow uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true at the same time").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I promptly followed up explaining the error: "Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do you believe they're contradictory?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was, of course, no reply at the time. The "area director" now simply repeats the erroneous argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As TLS (or IETF) is not phasing out all non-hybrid classics,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Non-hybrid classics" is weird terminology. Sometimes pre-quantum algorithms (ECC, RSA, etc.) are called "classical", so I guess the claim here is that using just ECC in TLS isn't being phased out. That's a bizarre claim. There are intensive efforts to roll out ECC+PQ in TLS to try to protect against quantum computers. Cloudflare reports the usage of post-quantum cryptography having risen to about 50% of all browsers that it sees (compared to 20% a year ago); within those connections, 95% use ECC+MLKEM768 and 5% use ECC+Kyber768.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "area director" also gives no explanation of why the "not phasing out" claim is supposed to be relevant here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I find this argument not strong enough&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See how the "area director" is saying the weight that the "area director" places on each argument (within the arguments selected and phrased by the "area director"), rather than evaluating whether there was consensus to adopt the document?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;to override the consensus of allowing non-hybrid standards from being defined&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Circular argument. There wasn't consensus to adopt the document in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;especially in light of the strong consensus for marking these as "not recommended".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think many readers will be baffled by this comment. If something is "not recommended", wouldn't that be an argument against standardizing it, rather than an argument for standardizing it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is that "not recommended" doesn't mean what you think it means: the "area director" is resorting to confusing jargon. I don't think there's any point getting into the weeds on this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incompetent planning for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Non-hybrids are a future end goal&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Additionally, since if/when we do end up in an era with a CRQC, we are ultimately designing for a world where the classic components offer less to no value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone is trying to argue for removing ECC, there's a big difference between the plausible scenario of ECC having "less" value and the extreme scenario of ECC having "no" value. It's wrong for the "area director" to be conflating these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I put it almost two years ago: "Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys. Yikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that! We don't even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break one key! Users who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography. But are the users going to say 'Let's turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack'? I'm skeptical. I think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let's think for a moment about the idea that one will eventually want to transition to just ML-KEM, the specific proposal that the "area director" is portraying as the future. Here are three ways that this can easily be wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe ML-KEM's implementation issues end up convincing the community to shift to a more robust option, analogously to what happened with ECC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe the advances in public attacks continue to the point of breaking ML-KEM outright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe the cliff stops crumbling and ML-KEM survives, but more efficient options also survive. At this point there are quite a few options more efficient than ML-KEM. (Random example: SMAUG. The current SMAUG software isn't as fast as the ML-KEM software, but this is outweighed by SMAUG using less network traffic than ML-KEM.) Probably some options will be broken, but ML-KEM would have to be remarkably lucky to end up as the most efficient remaining option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does this "area director" think that all of the more efficient options are going to be broken, while ML-KEM won't? Sounds absurdly overconfident. More likely is that the "area director" doesn't even realize that there are more efficient options. For anyone thinking "presumably those newer options have received less scrutiny than ML-KEM": we're talking about what to do long-term, remember?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking ML-KEM as the PQ component of ECC+PQ is working for getting something rolled out now. Hopefully ML-KEM will turn out to not be a security disaster (or a patent disaster). But, for guessing what will be best to do in 5 or 10 or 15 years, picking ML-KEM is premature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When and where to exactly draw the line of still using a classic component safeguard is speculation at best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the "area director" is clearly attacking a strawman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Already supporting pure post quantum algorithms now to gain experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is rolling out PQ supposed to be gaining experience that isn't gained from the current rollout of ECC+PQ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, I think it's important to call out the word "pure" here as incoherent, indefensible marketing. What we're actually talking about isn't modifying ML-KEM in any way; it's simply hashing the ML-KEM session key together with other inputs. Is ML-KEM no longer "pure" when it's plugged into TLS, which also hashes session keys? (The word "pure" also showed up in a few of the earlier quotes.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;while not recommending it at this time seems a valid strategy for the future, allowing people and organizations their own timeline of deciding when/if to go from hybrid to pure PQ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we again see the area director making a decision to support the document, rather than evaluating whether there was consensus in the WG to adopt the document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again getting the complexity evaluation backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Added complexity of hybrids&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There was some discussion on whether or not hybrids add more complexity, and thus add risk, compared to non-hybrids. While arguments were made that proper classic algorithms add only a trivial amount of extra resources, it was also pointed out that there is a cost of implementation, deployment and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here the "area director" is again making the same mistake explained earlier: ignoring the fact that ECC+PQ is already there, and thus getting the complexity evaluation backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "thus add risk" logic is also wrong. Again, all of these options are more complex than the null cipher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the existence of draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design and the extensive discussions around "chempat" vs "xwing" vs "kitchensink" shows that there is at least some complexity that is added by the hybrid solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, the details of how to combine ECC with PQ in TLS are already settled and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking beyond TLS: Chempat hashes the transcript (similarly to TLS), making it robust for a wide range of protocols. The other options add fragility by hashing less for the sake of minor cost savings. Each of these options is under 10 lines of code. The "area director" exaggerates the complexity by mentioning "extensive discussions", and spends much more effort hyping this complexity as a risk than acknowledging the risks of further PQ attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's not as if the presence of this document has eliminated the discussions of ECC+PQ details, nor is there any credible mechanism by which it could do so. Again, the actual choice at hand is whether to have PQ as an option alongside ECC+PQ. Adding that option adds complexity. The "area director" is getting the complexity comparison backwards by instead comparing (1) PQ in isolation to (2) ECC+PQ in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Botching the evaluation of human factors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;RFCs being interpreted as IETF recommendation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems there is disagreement about whether the existence of an RFC itself qualifies as the IETF defacto "recommending" this in the view of IETF outsiders/ implemeners whom do not take into account any IANA registry RECOMMENDED setting or the Mandatory-To-Implement (MTI) reommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would expect a purchasing manager to have instructions along the lines of "Buy only products complying with the standards", and to never see IETF's confusing jumble of further designations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is an area where we recently found out there is little consensus on an IETF wide crypto policy statement via an RFC. The decision on whether an RFC adds value to a Code Point should therefor be taken independently of any such notion of how outsiders might interpret the existence of an RFC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a security perspective, it's a big mistake to ignore the human factor, such as the impact of a purchasing manager saying "This is the most efficient standard so I'll pick that".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this case, while Section 3 could be considered informative, I believe Section 4 and Section 5 are useful (normative) content that assists implementers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this supposed to have something to do with the consensus question?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And people have proposed extending the Security Considerations to more clearly state that this algorithm is not recommended at this point in time. Without an RFC, these recommendations cannot be published by the IETF in a way that implementers would be known to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, "known to consume"! There was, um, one of those, uh, studies showing the details of, um, how implementors use RFCs, which, uh, showed that 100% of the implementors diligently consumed the warnings in the RFCs. Yeah, that's the ticket. I'm sure the URL for this study is sitting around here somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's get back to the real world. Even if an implementor does see a "This document is a bad idea" warning, this simply doesn't matter when the implementors are chasing contracts issued by purchasing managers who simply care what's standardized and haven't seen the warning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's much smarter for the document to (1) eliminate making the proposal that it's warning about and (2) focus, starting in the title, on saying why such proposals are bad. This makes people more likely to see the warning, and at the same time it removes the core problem of the bad proposal being standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fictions regarding country actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Say no to Nation State algorithms&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The history and birth of MLKEM from Kyber through a competition of the international Cryptographic Community, organized through US NIST can hardly be called or compared to unilateral dictated nation state algorithm selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NIST repeatedly refused to designate the "NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process" as a "competition". It even wrote that the process "should not be treated as a competition".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certainly there were competition-like aspects to the process. I tend to refer to it as a competition. But in the end the selection of algorithms to standardize was made by NIST, with input behind the scenes from NSA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There has been no other comparable public effort to gather cryptographers and publicly discuss post-quantum crypto candidates in a multi-years effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonsense. The premier multi-year effort by cryptographers to "publicly discuss post-quantum crypto candidates" is the cryptographic literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In fact, other nation states are heavily relying on the results produced by this competition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the objection from Stephen Farrell that the "area director" isn't quoting or linking to: "I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will certainly arise".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reading this objection, you can see how the "area director" is sort of responding to it by suggesting that everybody is following NIST (i.e., that the "certainly arise" part is wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's not true. NIST's selections are controversial. For example, ISO is considering not just ML-KEM but also&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Classic McEliece, where NIST has said it's waiting for ISO ("After the ISO standardization process has been completed, NIST may consider developing a standard for Classic McEliece based on the ISO standard"), and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FrodoKEM, which NIST said "will not be considered further for standardization".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISO is also now considering NTRU, where the advertisement includes "All patents related to NTRU have expired" (very different from the ML-KEM situation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSI, which sets cryptographic standards for Germany, recommends not just ML-KEM but also FrodoKEM (which it describes as "more conservative" than ML-KEM) and Classic McEliece ("conservative and very thoroughly analysed"). Meanwhile China has called for submissions of new post-quantum proposals for standardization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could keep going, but this is enough evidence to show that Farrell's prediction was correct; the "area director" is once again wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The use of MLKEM in the IETF will not set a precedent for having to accept other nation state cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice how the "area director" is dodging Farrell's point. If NSA can pressure the TLS WG into standardizing non-hybrid ML-KEM, why can't China pressure the TLS WG into standardizing something China wants? What criteria will IETF use to answer this question without leaving the WG "open to accusations of favouritism"? If you want people to believe that it isn't about the money then you need a really convincing alternative story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Not recommending pure PQ right now&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There was a strong consensus that pure PQ should not be recommended at this time, which is reflected in the document. There was some discussion on RECOMMENDED N vs D, which is something that can be discussed in the WG during the document's lifecycle before WGLC. It was further argued that adopting and publishing this document gives the WG control over the accompanying warning text, such as Security Considerations, that can reflect the current consensus of not recommending pure MLKEM over hybrid at publication time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just rehashing earlier text, even if the detailed wording is a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The pure MLKEM code points exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Irrelevant. The question is whether they're being standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;An international market segment that wants to use pure MLKEM exists&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"International"? Like Swedish company Ericsson setting up its "Ericsson Federal Technologies Group" in 2024 to receive U.S. military contracts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;as can be seen by the consensus call outcome&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Um, how?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;along with existing implementations of the draft on mainstream devices and software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, NSA waving around money has convinced some corporations to provide software. How is this supposed to justify the claim that "there was rough consensus to adopt the document"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a rough consensus to adopt the document&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repeating a claim doesn't make it true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;with a strong consensus for RECOMMENDED N and not MTI, which is reflected in the draft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Irrelevant. What matters is whether the document is standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reasons to not publish MLKEM as an RFC seem more based on personal opinions of risk and trust not shared amongst all participants as facts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sort of dismissal might be more convincing if it were coming from someone providing more URLs and fewer easily debunked claims. But it's in any case not addressing the consensus question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Based on the above, I believe the WG Chairs made the correct call that there was rough consensus for adopting draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chairs claimed that "we have consensus to adopt this draft" (based on claiming that "there were enough people willing to review the draft", never mind the number of objections). That claim is wrong. The call for adoption failed to reach consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "area director" claimed that "There is clearly consensus based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ... The vast majority was in favour of adoption ... There were a few dissenting opinions". These statements still haven't been retracted; they were and are outright lies about what happened. Again, the actual tallies were 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption, 2 people conditionally supporting adoption, and 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without admitting error, the "area director" has retreated to a claim of "rough consensus". The mishmash of ad-hoc comments from the "area director" certainly doesn't demonstrate any coherent meaning of "rough consensus".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fascinating that IETF's advertising to the public claims that IETF's "decision-making requires achieving broad consensus", but IETF's WG procedures allow controversial documents to be pushed through on the basis of "rough consensus". To be clear, that's only if the "area director" approves of the documents, as you can see from the same "area director" issuing yet another mishmash of ad-hoc comments to overturn a separate chair decision in September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You would think that the WG procedures would define "rough consensus". They don't. All they say is that "51% of the working group does not qualify as 'rough consensus' and 99% is better than rough", not even making clear whether 51% of voters within a larger working group can qualify. This leaves a vast range of ambiguous intermediate cases up to the people in power.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Corvus Robotics is scaling the largest autonomous logistics data capture fleet ever built. If you're allergic to leaded solder, actual revenue, spreadsheets, or ambiguity -- this role is not for you. More "cardboard boxes," less "Pelican cases."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our fleet of flying warehouse drones is 5x-ing in 2026, and I'm looking for a generalist ex-founder or manufacturing leader in the SF Bay Area who wants to get their hands dirty massively scaling manufacturing operations in the US and overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We need someone who has worked on hardware products (not just SaaS), communicates clearly, and is relentlessly resourceful. Mandarin proficiency and leading a product through EVT/DVT/PVT is an added bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If this resonates with you, DM me, or send a super short email to a@ our url with: - why you’re interested - what was the biggest manufacturing fuckup you've recovered from - your target comp&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;cool-retro-term is a terminal emulator which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens. It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses the QML port of qtermwidget (Konsole): https://github.com/Swordfish90/qmltermwidget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This terminal emulator works under Linux and macOS and requires Qt5. It's suggested that you stick to the latest LTS version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Settings such as colors, fonts, and effects can be accessed via context menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to get a hold of the latest version, just go to the Releases page and grab the latest AppImage (Linux) or dmg (macOS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, most distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch already package cool-retro-term in their official repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the wiki and follow the instructions on how to build it on Linux and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Before a car crash in 2008 left her paralysed from the neck down, Nancy Smith enjoyed playing the piano. Years later, Smith started making music again, thanks to an implant that recorded and analysed her brain activity. When she imagined playing an on-screen keyboard, her brain–computer interface (BCI) translated her thoughts into keystrokes — and simple melodies, such as ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’, rang out1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there was a twist. For Smith, it seemed as if the piano played itself. “It felt like the keys just automatically hit themselves without me thinking about it,” she said at the time. “It just seemed like it knew the tune, and it just did it on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smith’s BCI system, implanted as part of a clinical trial, trained on her brain signals as she imagined playing the keyboard. That learning enabled the system to detect her intention to play hundreds of milliseconds before she consciously attempted to do so, says trial leader Richard Andersen, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smith is one of roughly 90 people who, over the past two decades, have had BCIs implanted to control assistive technologies, such as computers, robotic arms or synthetic voice generators. These volunteers — paralysed by spinal-cord injuries, strokes or neuromuscular disorders, such as motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) — have demonstrated how command signals for the body’s muscles, recorded from the brain’s motor cortex as people imagine moving, can be decoded into commands for connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Smith, who died of cancer in 2023, was among the first volunteers to have an extra interface implanted in her posterior parietal cortex, a brain region associated with reasoning, attention and planning. Andersen and his team think that by also capturing users’ intentions and pre-motor planning, such ‘dual-implant’ BCIs will improve the performance of prosthetic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andersen’s research also illustrates the potential of BCIs that access areas outside the motor cortex. “The surprise was that when we go into the posterior parietal, we can get signals that are mixed together from a large number of areas,” says Andersen. “There’s a wide variety of things that we can decode.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability of these devices to access aspects of a person’s innermost life, including preconscious thought, raises the stakes on concerns about how to keep neural data private. It also poses ethical questions about how neurotechnologies might shape people’s thoughts and actions — especially when paired with artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, AI is enhancing the capabilities of wearable consumer products that record signals from outside the brain. Ethicists worry that, left unregulated, these devices could give technology companies access to new and more precise data about people’s internal reactions to online and other content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ethicists and BCI developers are now asking how previously inaccessible information should be handled and used. “Whole-brain interfacing is going to be the future,” says Tom Oxley, chief executive of Synchron, a BCI company in New York City. He predicts that the desire to treat psychiatric conditions and other brain disorders will lead to more brain regions being explored. Along the way, he says, AI will continue to improve decoding capabilities and change how these systems serve their users. “It leads you to the final question: how do we make that safe?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consumer concerns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consumer neurotech products capture less-sophisticated data than implanted BCIs do. Unlike implanted BCIs, which rely on the firings of specific collections of neurons, most consumer products rely on electroencephalography (EEG). This measures ripples of electrical activity that arise from the averaged firing of huge neuronal populations and are detectable on the scalp. Rather than being created to capture the best recording possible, consumer devices are designed to be stylish (such as in sleek headbands) or unobtrusive (with electrodes hidden inside headphones or headsets for augmented or virtual reality).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, EEG can reveal overall brain states, such as alertness, focus, tiredness and anxiety levels. Companies already offer headsets and software that give customers real-time scores relating to these states, with the intention of helping them to improve their sports performance, meditate more effectively or become more productive, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI has helped to turn noisy signals from suboptimal recording systems into reliable data, explains Ramses Alcaide, chief executive of Neurable, a neurotech company in Boston, Massachusetts, that specializes in EEG signal processing and sells a headphone-based headset for this purpose. “We’ve made it so that EEG doesn’t suck as much as it used to,” Alcaide says. “Now, it can be used in real-life environments, essentially.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there is widespread anticipation that AI will allow further aspects of users’ mental processes to be decoded. For example, Marcello Ienca, a neuroethicist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, says that EEG can detect small voltage changes in the brain that occur within hundreds of milliseconds of a person perceiving a stimulus. Such signals could reveal how their attention and decision-making relate to that specific stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although accurate user numbers are hard to gather, many thousands of enthusiasts are already using neurotech headsets. And ethicists say that a big tech company could suddenly catapult the devices to widespread use. Apple, for example, patented a design for EEG sensors for future use in its Airpods wireless earphones in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet unlike BCIs aimed at the clinic, which are governed by medical regulations and privacy protections, the consumer BCI space has little legal oversight, says David Lyreskog, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, UK. “There’s a wild west when it comes to the regulatory standards,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Ienca and his colleagues found that most consumer BCIs don’t use secure data-sharing channels or implement state-of-the-art privacy technologies2. “I believe that has not changed,” Ienca says. What’s more, a 2024 analysis3 of the data policies of 30 consumer neurotech companies by the Neurorights Foundation, a non-profit organization in New York City, showed that nearly all had complete control over the data users provided. That means most firms can use the information as they please, including selling it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responding to such concerns, the government of Chile and the legislators of four US states have passed laws that give direct recordings of any form of nerve activity protected status. But Ienca and Nita Farahany, an ethicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, fear that such laws are insufficient because they focus on the raw data and not on the inferences that companies can make by combining neural information with parallel streams of digital data. Inferences about a person’s mental health, say, or their political allegiances could still be sold to third parties and used to discriminate against or manipulate a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The data economy, in my view, is already quite privacy-violating and cognitive- liberty-violating,” Ienca says. Adding neural data, he says, “is like giving steroids to the existing data economy”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several key international bodies, including the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have issued guidelines on these issues. Furthermore, in September, three US senators introduced an act that would require the Federal Trade Commission to review how data from neurotechnology should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heading to the clinic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While their development advances at pace, so far no implanted BCI has been approved for general clinical use. Synchron’s device is closest to the clinic. This relatively simple BCI allows users to select on-screen options by imagining moving their foot. Because it is inserted into a blood vessel on the surface of the motor cortex, it doesn’t require neurosurgery. It has proved safe, robust and effective in initial trials4, and Oxley says Synchron is discussing a pivotal trial with the US Food and Drug Administration that could lead to clinical approval.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s neurotech firm Neuralink in Fremont, California, has surgically implanted its more complex device in the motor cortices of at least 13 volunteers who are using it to play computer games, for example, and control robotic hands. Company representatives say that more than 10,000 people have joined waiting lists for its clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least five more BCI companies have tested their devices in humans for the first time over the past two years, making short-term recordings (on timescales ranging from minutes to weeks) in people undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Researchers in the field say the first approvals are likely to be for devices in the motor cortex that restore independence to people who have severe paralysis — including BCIs that enable speech through synthetic voice technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for what’s next, Farahany says that moving beyond the motor cortex is a widespread goal among BCI developers. “All of them hope to go back further in time in the brain,” she says, “and to get to that subconscious precursor to thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, Andersen’s group published a proof-of-concept study5 in which internal dialogue was decoded from the parietal cortex of two participants, albeit with an extremely limited vocabulary. The team has also recorded from the parietal cortex while a BCI user played the card game blackjack (pontoon)6. Certain neurons responded to the face values of cards, whereas others tracked the cumulative total of a player’s hand. Some even became active when the player decided whether to stick with their current hand or take another card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Oxley and Matt Angle, chief executive of BCI company Paradromics, based in Austin, Texas, agree that BCIs in brain regions other than the motor cortex might one day help to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions. Maryam Shanechi, an engineer and computer scientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, is working towards this goal — in part by aiming to identify and monitor neural signatures of psychiatric diseases and their symptoms7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BCIs could potentially track such symptoms in a person, deliver stimulation that adjusts neural activity and quantify how the brain responds to that stimulation or other interventions. “That feedback is important, because you want to precisely tailor the therapy to that individual’s own needs,” Shanechi says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shanechi does not yet know whether the neural correlates of psychiatric symptoms will be trackable across many brain regions or whether they will require recording from specific brain areas. Either way, a central aspect of her work is building foundation models of brain activity. Such models, constructed by training AI algorithms on thousands of hours of neural data from numerous people, would in theory be generalizable across individuals’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;TSMC Arizona Outage Saw Fab Halt, Apple Wafers Scrapped&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;[Exclusive] Supply of industrial gases used for chipmaking was cut when power at a vendor's facilities was interrupted.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good Evening from Taipei,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A power outage at an industrial gas facility servicing TSMC interrupted manufacturing at the company’s Fab 21 in Arizona late last quarter, sources told me. The incident stopped the flow of crucial inputs needed for chipmaking, forcing the facility to shut down for at least a few hours, I was told. As a result, the company had to scrap thousands of wafers that were in production for clients at the site which include Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The event happened mid-September and was caused by a power fault at its outsourced vendor Linde, a British industrial gases and engineering company, my sources tell me. TSMC runs a lot of its own gas supply in Taiwan, but opted to contract the work out for its Arizona site. While mistakes happen, and insurance may cover some of the losses from the event, Linde has been put on notice to identify and rectify the cause of the outage, I was told. A PR representative for Linde didn’t answer multiple phone calls and emails from Culpium outlining the incident and requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s Arizona unit turned profitable in the first quarter of this year, a sign of the Taiwanese company’s ability to quickly scale up and churn out chips even in higher-cost locales like the US. But a 99% drop in net income in the third quarter to just $1.4 million had folks scratching their head. One writer was quick to jump to conclusions, with the assumption that “rising costs have taken out an enormous chunk of profits, putting pressure on the firm’s operations.” The September outage, which hasn’t previously been reported, offers an alternative explanation for the profit decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“TSMC Arizona has begun to positively contribute to TSMC’s revenue. However, the company’s profit is influenced by multiple factors and should be read over time,” TSMC wrote in response to a detailed account of what Culpium has been told about the outage. “We also stated before that the ramp up for our overseas fabs will lead to gross margin dilution in the next five years, starting from 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the company declined to immediately address the issue of the manufacturing disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fab shutdowns are unusual, at least for TSMC. With equipment so expensive, its factories are run 24/7. That means that an hour of idle time can cost millions of dollars. Compounding the financial effect of this incident was the fact that it occurred late in the quarter, leaving little room to make up for lost production before the quarter closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Profit margins on new facilities and at new nodes tend to be quite thin, even negative. In addition, TSMC has been ramping up capacity in Arizona and that capex gets reflected in depreciation costs even before the new equipment can start producing revenue. So it’s reasonable to see fluctuations in net income at the site. A halt in production and scrapping of wafers adds to the costs, dragging on earnings even if only slightly and briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impact to clients is likely to be negligible, I was told, and the financial loss to TSMC may be covered by insurance. Capacity at Fab 21 is still quite small, and many products being made there have already been taped out and manufactured in Taiwan previously. In past disruptions, lost production and revenue was made up in the subsequent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the broader issue is that Taiwanese manufacturers are good at managing their operations when they handle it themselves, but still face struggles when they need to lean on non-Taiwanese firms at overseas facilities. The entire process of building the fab and installing equipment at Arizona has been an exercise in cross-cultural adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common cause of production interruptions at TSMC is Mother Nature. Earthquakes regularly rattle Taiwan, and fabs are built to withstand most of them. But sometimes a big tremor can trigger a safety shutdown, while really nasty temblors have caused actual damage. Beyond natural disasters, there’ve been few man-made shutdowns at TSMC because they’re pretty rigorous about operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of notable problems were both caused by vendors, not TSMC internally. In 2018, a computer virus was introduced to fabs via equipment from Japan. That incident sparked a whole new approach to cybersecurity both at TSMC and among fellow Taiwanese chipmakers. Less than a year later, a batch of contaminated photoresist from a chemical supplier forced the company to scrap a large number of wafers. It made up the production the following quarter, with the problem costing TSMC around $25 million in operating profit for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linde trumpeted the TSMC contract when it landed the deal back in 2021, noting that it planned to invest $600 million into the facility. “While the project is capital and electricity intensive, it will only employ 14 plant employees and 14 truck drivers, documents from 2020 said,” the Arizona Tech Council later reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s A16 SoC was the first product taped out at the site, Culpium reported in September last year. AMD’s Ryzen 9000 and Nvidia Blackwell chips were since added to the lineup with designs from Bitdeer, among others, also qualified at the Arizona fab.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Bitter Lesson of LLM Extensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, “using an LLM” meant pasting a wall of text into a chat box and hoping for something useful back. Today, we point agents at our codebases, our browsers, and let them go off and act on our behalf. A key question that has been brewing under the surface during this time has been: how do we let end users actually customize these systems?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As models have become more capable, the ways and mechanisms that end users have access to customize them have expanded as well. We've gone from simple system prompts to complex client-server protocols and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the history of LLM extension over the last three years and where I see it going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ChatGPT Plugins (March 2023)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just four months after launch, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Plugins. Looking back, these were wildly ahead of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea was ambitious: give the LLM a link to an OpenAPI spec and let it "run wild" calling REST endpoints. It was a direct line to AGI-style thinking: universal tool use via standard APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "name_for_human": "TODO Manager",
  "name_for_model": "todo_manager",
  "description_for_human": "Manages your TODOs!",
  "description_for_model": "An app for managing a user's TODOs",
  "api": { "url": "/openapi.json" },
  "auth": { "type": "none" },
  "logo_url": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "legal_info_url": "http://example.com",
  "contact_email": "hello@example.com"
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? The models weren't ready. GPT-3.5 (and even early GPT-4) struggled to navigate massive API specs without hallucinating or getting lost in context. Plus, the UX was clunky. You had to manually toggle plugins for every chat!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what that looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it gave us a glimpse of the future: The Code Interpreter plugin (later Advanced Data Analysis) became indispensable, foreshadowing the powerful sandboxed execution environments we use today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Custom Instructions (July 2023)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom instructions were the "smooth brain" counter-reaction to the complexity of plugins. I did a double take when writing this because I thought for sure this feature was released before plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was just a user-defined prompt appended to every chat. Simple. Obvious. Yet it solved a huge problem: repetitive context setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the spiritual ancestor to every &lt;code&gt;.cursorrules&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Custom GPTs (Nov 2023)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI repackaged instructions and tools into Custom GPTs. This was an attempt to "productize" prompt engineering. You could bundle a persona, some files, and a few actions into a shareable link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a retreat from the open-ended promise of plugins toward curated, single-purpose "apps."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory in ChatGPT (February 2024)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we've discussed manual ways to extend LLMs. Memory represented a shift toward automatic personalization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT Memory records details from your conversations and quietly inserts them into future context. It's like a system prompt that writes itself. If you mention you're a vegetarian, it remembers that weeks later. It’s a small feature, but it marked the beginning of agents that maintain long-term state without user intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cursor Rules (April 2024)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor changed the game by putting custom instructions where they belonged: in the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.cursorrules&lt;/code&gt; file was a revelation. Instead of pasting context into a chat window, you committed it to git.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"We use tabs, not spaces."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"No semicolons."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Always use TypeScript."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as a single file, then evolved into a &lt;code&gt;.cursor/rules&lt;/code&gt; folder with sophisticated scoping. You could organize multiple rule files, and even define when they applied, for example, only for certain file types or subdirectories. It was the first time extension felt "native" to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later Cursor introduced the ability to let the LLM decide when to apply a rule, which is a pattern we will see again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Model Context Protocol (Nov 2024)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late 2024, models were finally smart enough to handle real tools reliably. Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) was the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MCP is a heavyweight solution. An MCP client needs to keep a persistent connection to an MCP server. The server serves up tool definitions, resources, and prompts to the client (in most cases is an agent) and it can send a message to the server saying a tool has been called and the server can respond with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Custom Instructions (which just add context), MCP gives the model actual capabilities. It can read your repo, query your Postgres DB, or deploy to Vercel. Besides just providing tools, it also allows servers to provide resources (documents, logs) and prompts directly to the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's powerful, and perhaps a bit of overkill. While the complexity might be worth it for agent developers asking a user to set up and connect an MCP is a lot of friction and there is an entire ecosystem of startups like Smithery built around making it easier to use MCP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that ChatGPT apps which were announced in October 2025 are built on top of MCP as a base layer. This is an attempt to make it easier for end users to use MCP without having to actually think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Claude Code: New Agent, New Extensions (Feb 2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early 2025 brought us Claude Code, which essentially added every extension mechanism under the sun to an agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;: The standard for repo-level instructions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MCP: For heavy-duty tool integration.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slash Commands: Like Cursor's notebooks, for reusable prompts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hooks: The ability to intercept and modify the agent's loop (e.g., "Stop if the tests fail").&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sub-agents: Spawning specialized workers to handle sub-tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Output Styles: (Deprecated) Configuring tone and format.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time will tell how many of these features will stick around in the long term. Anthropic has already tried to deprecate output styles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Agent Skills (Oct 2025)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next extension mechanism added to Claude Code is significant enough to warrant a deeper dive. Agent Skills are the rebirth of ChatGPT Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While MCP has a whole client-server protocol, Agent Skills are just folders of markdown files and scripts (in whatever language you choose).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent simply scans a &lt;code&gt;skills/&lt;/code&gt; directory, reads the frontmatter of every &lt;code&gt;SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt;, and builds a lightweight index. It then chooses to read the full contents of a skill only if it's appropriate for the current task. This solves one of the major problems with MCP: the context bloat that comes from having to load all of the tool definitions into the context window at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a snippet of the structure of a skill for doing e2e testing with Playwright taken from Anthropic's Skills examples repository:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;webapp-testing/
├── examples/
│   ├── console_logging.py
│   ├── element_discovery.py
│   └── static_html_automation.py
├── scripts/
│   └── with_server.py
└── SKILL.md
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a mix of scripts, examples, and plain text instructions. The only required file is the SKILL.md file. Let's take a look at that file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;---
name: webapp-testing
description: Toolkit for interacting with and testing local web applications using Playwright. Supports verifying frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, capturing browser screenshots, and viewing browser logs.

# Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

**Helper Scripts Available**:

- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is absolutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.

... skill continues ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a plain markdown file with some metadata and a description of the skill. The agent reads the file which freely references other files that the agent can read. In contrast a playwright MCP server has dozens of tool definitions to control a browser, this skill just says "you have bash, this is how you write a playwright script".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted to use a skill the agent needs to have general purpose access to a computer, but this is the bitter lesson in action. Giving an agent general purpose tools and trusting it to have the ability to use them to accomplish a task might very well be the winning strategy over making specialized tools for every task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the future holds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are the actualization of the dream that was set out by ChatGPT Plugins: just give the model instructions and some generic tools and trust it to do the glue work in-between. But I have a hypothesis that it might actually work now because the models are actually smart enough for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent skills work because it assumes the agent has the ability to write its own tools (via bash commands). You can just give it code snippets and ask the agent to figure out how to run them generically for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, I think that skills signal towards a new definition of what an agent really is. An agent isn't just a LLM in a while loop. It's an LLM in a while loop that has a computer strapped to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code is the piece of software that first made this click for me, but it is way too developer focused to be the final form. Other applications like Zo Computer try to package the llm and computer together into a single application, but I still think it still doesn't abstract the computer away enough from the end user. If I ask a coworker to do something, I don't need to see their entire file system, I just need to know that they have a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking forward into 2026 I expect more and more llm applications that we use will have a computer strapped to them in new and interesting ways, whether we know it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I could short MCP, I would, and I expect us to go back to extending our agents with the most accessible programming language: natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GrapheneOS migrates server infrastructure from France amid police intimidation claims&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GrapheneOS project has announced on X that they are ceasing all operations in France, asserting that the country is no longer safe for "open source privacy projects".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the operating system will still be available to French users, all website and discussion servers are being relocated abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, the project relied on OVH Bearharnois, a French hosting provider, for its core website and social media services. The migration plan moves the Mastodon, Discourse, and Matrix instances to a combination of local and shared servers in Toronto. Critical website infrastructure will be hosted by Netcup, a German‑based company.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS claims that they does not collect confidential user data in their servers or store critical infrastructure in France. Therefore, the migration does not affect services such as signature verification and downgrade protection for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Citing the government's support of the European Union Chat Control proposal, GrapheneOS developers are also refusing travel to France. Developers are no longer allowed to work inside the country due to safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This decision was sparked by negative press coverage from two articles published by Le Parisien. An interview with French cybercrime prosecutor Johanna Brousse implies potential legal action against the project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;"With this new tool, there is real legitimacy for a certain portion of users in the desire to protect their exchanges. The approach is therefore different. But that won't stop us from suing the publishers if links are discovered with a criminal organization and they don't cooperate with the law"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS argues that Le Parisien have conflated their project with government-sponsored forks, which are fake copies of their operating system. The news outlet refers to a fake Snapchat app, dark web advertising, and a series of unlisted YouTube videos that are not features of GrapheneOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project had previously threatened litigation against these government-sponsored forks. One prominent example is ANOM, an FBI-backed shell company that developed a compromised Android operating system and messaging platform as part of Operation Trojan Horse from 2018 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Watch Software Is Now 100% Open Source + Tick Talk #4 - PT2 Demos!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[2025-11-24]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another big Pebble update today! TLDR:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Pebble watch software was ~95% open source. Today, it’s 100% open source. You can download, compile and run all the software you need to use your Pebble. We just published the source code for the new Pebble mobile app!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Appstore now has a publicly available backup and supports multiple feeds, providing long term reliability through decentralization. We’ve launched our own feed and Developer Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Time 2 schedule update (aiming to begin shipping in January, with most arriving on wrists in March/April)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last year, and especially in the last week, I've chatted with tons of people in the Pebble community. One of the main questions people have is ‘how do I know that my new Pebble watch will continue to work long into the future?’. It’s an extremely valid question and concern - one that I share as a fellow Pebble wearer. I called this out specifically in my blog post announcing the relaunch in January 2025. How is this time round going to be different from last time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two pieces to making Pebble sustainable long term - hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing lasts forever, especially an inexpensive gadget like a Pebble. We want to be able to keep manufacturing these watches long into the future - mostly because I will always want one on my wrist! The company I set up to relaunch Pebble, Core Devices, is self funded, built without investors, and extremely lean. As long as we stay profitable (ie we don’t lose money), we will continue to manufacture new watches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also making sure that our new watches are more repairable than old Pebble watches. The back cover of Pebble Time 2 is screwed in. You can remove the back cover and replace the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve also published electrical and mechanical design files for Pebble 2 Duo. Yes, you can download the schematic (includes KiCad project files) right now on Github! This should give you a nice jumpstart to designing your own PebbleOS-compatible device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last time round, barely any of the Pebble software was open source. This made it very hard for the Pebble community to make improvements to their watches after the company behind Pebble shut down. Things are different now! This whole relaunch came about primarily because Google open sourced PebbleOS (thank you!). Yesterday, the software that powers Pebble watches was around 95% open source. As of today, it’s now 100%. This means that if Core Devices were to disappear into a black hole, you have all the source code you need to build, run and improve the software behind your Pebble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I confess that I misunderstood why 95% was much less sustainable than 100% until recently. I discuss this in more detail in my latest Tick Talk episode (check it out). Long story short - I’m an Android user and was happy to sideload the old Pebble APK on my phone, but iPhone and other Android users have basically been stuck without an easily available Pebble mobile companion app for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how we’re making sure the 3 main Pebble software components are open source and guaranteed to work long into the future:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PebbleOS - software that runs on your watch itself. This has been 100% open source since January and we’ve committed to open sourcing all the improvements we’ve made → github.com/coredevices/PebbleOS. You can download the source code, compile PebbleOS and easily install it over Bluetooth on your new Pebble. Textbook definition of open source!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble mobile companion app - the app that for your iPhone or Android. Without the app, your Pebble is basically a paperweight. When the Pebble Tech Corp died, the lack of an open source mobile app made it difficult for anyone to continue to use their watches. We had to build an entirely new app (get it here). Today, our app is now 100% open source on Github- ensuring that what happened before cannot happen again. Want to learn more about how we built the new app cross platform using Kotlin Multiplatform?

    &lt;p&gt;Developer tools and Pebble Appstore - this software enables people to build and share their watchapps and watchfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of dev tools, just being open source is not enough. They needed to be updated to work on modern computers. Before we made improvements, the state of the art of Pebble app development was using an Ubuntu virtualbox VM with Python2! Over the summer, our incredibly productive intern upgraded all the SDK and dev tools and created a new way to develop Pebble apps in the browser. You should check them out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there’s the Pebble Appstore. This is a collection of nearly 15,000 watchfaces and watchapps that you - the Pebble community - developed between 2012 and July 2018. When Fitbit pulled the plug on the original Pebble Appstore, the Rebble Foundation downloaded a copy of all the apps and faces, and set up a new web service to let users of the old Pebble app continue to download and use watchfaces. This was an incredible effort, one that I have used thousands of times and am a happy paying subscriber. But it’s still centralized - if their server disappears, there is no freely available backup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compensate for that, today we’re launching two new things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pebble mobile app will soon (later this week) be able to subscribe to multiple appstore ‘feeds’. This is similar to open source package managers like pip, AUR, APT, etc. Anyone can create a Pebble-compatible appstore feed and users will be able to browse apps from that feed in the Pebble mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve created our own Pebble Appstore feed (appstore-api.repebble.com) and new Developer Dashboard. Our feed (fyi powered by 100% new software) is configured to back up an archive of all apps and faces to Archive.org (backup will gradually complete over the next week). Today, our feed only has a subset of all Pebble watchfaces and apps (thank you aveao for creating Pebble Archive!). Developers - you can upload your existing or new apps right now! We hope that this sets a standard for openness and we encourage all feeds to publish a freely and publicly available archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important to note - developers will still be able to charge money for their apps and faces, using Kiezel pay or other services. This change does not preclude them from doing that, in fact it makes it even easier - I could see some developers creating a paid-only feed. As I recently wrote, we're also working on other ways for Pebble developers to earn money by publishing fun, beautiful and creative Pebble apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another important note - some binary blobs and other non-free software components are used today in PebbleOS and the Pebble mobile app (ex: the heart rate sensor on PT2 , Memfault library, and others). Optional non-free web services, like Wispr-flow API speech recognizer, are also used. These non-free software components are not required - you can compile and run Pebble watch software without them. This will always be the case. More non-free software components may appear in our software in the future. The core Pebble watch software stack (everything you need to use your Pebble watch) will always be open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-production Pebble Time 2. These watches are not final quality! We are still tweaking and tuning everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PT2 Schedule Update&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re currently in the middle of Pebble Time 2 design verification test (DVT) phase. After we finish that, we go into production verification test (PVT) and then mass production (MP). So far, things are proceeding according to the schedule update I shared last month but that is extraordinarily subject to change. We still have a lot of testing (especially waterproof and environmental) to go. If we find problems (which is likely) we will push the schedule back to make improvements to the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one major complicating factor is the timing of Chinese New Year (CNY). It’s early next year - factories will shut down for 3 weeks starting around the end of January. After restarting, things always take a week or two to get back to full speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are trying our best to get into mass production and ship out at most several thousand Pebble Time 2s before CNY. It’s going to be very tight 🤞. More likely is that production will begin after CNY, then we need to transfer the watches to our fulfillment center, and ship them out. Realistically, at this time we’re forecasting that the majority of people will receive their PT2 in March and April. Please keep in mind that things may still change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking a PT2 colour&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There will be 4 colour options for PT2 - black/black, black/red, silver/blue, silver/(white most likely). Let me be crystal very clear - no one has picked a colour yet 😃. In a few weeks, I will send out an email asking everyone who pre-ordered a Pebble Time 2 to select which colour they would like to receive. Please do not email us asking when this email will be sent out. No one has been invited yet to do this. I will post here after all emails have gone out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a related note, I am extremely happy that we built and shipped Pebble 2 Duo. Not only is it an awesome watch, it was also a phenomenal way for us to exercise our production muscles and ease back into the systematic flow of building and shipping smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A video is worth a million words - so I encourage you to watch me demo Pebble Time 2 watches I just received this week. Keep in mind these watches are PRE-PRODUCTION which means they parts have imperfect qualities! Subject to change!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The video below opens to the part of the video where I do the demo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our newest model, Claude Opus 4.5, is available today. It’s intelligent, efficient, and the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use. It’s also meaningfully better at everyday tasks like deep research and working with slides and spreadsheets. Opus 4.5 is a step forward in what AI systems can do, and a preview of larger changes to how work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is state-of-the-art on tests of real-world software engineering:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.5 is available today on our apps, our API, and on all three major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, simply use &lt;code&gt;claude-opus-4-5-20251101&lt;/code&gt; via the Claude API. Pricing is now $5/$25 per million tokens—making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams, and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Opus, we’re releasing updates to the Claude Developer Platform, Claude Code, and our consumer apps. There are new tools for longer-running agents and new ways to use Claude in Excel, Chrome, and on desktop. In the Claude apps, lengthy conversations no longer hit a wall. See our product-focused section below for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First impressions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our Anthropic colleagues tested the model before release, we heard remarkably consistent feedback. Testers noted that Claude Opus 4.5 handles ambiguity and reasons about tradeoffs without hand-holding. They told us that, when pointed at a complex, multi-system bug, Opus 4.5 figures out the fix. They said that tasks that were near-impossible for Sonnet 4.5 just a few weeks ago are now within reach. Overall, our testers told us that Opus 4.5 just “gets it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our customers with early access have had similar experiences. Here are some examples of what they told us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Opus models have always been “the real SOTA” but have been cost prohibitive in the past. Claude Opus 4.5 is now at a price point where it can be your go-to model for most tasks. It’s the clear winner and exhibits the best frontier task planning and tool calling we’ve seen yet.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivers high-quality code and excels at powering heavy-duty agentic workflows with GitHub Copilot. Early testing shows it surpasses internal coding benchmarks while cutting token usage in half, and is especially well-suited for tasks like code migration and code refactoring.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 beats Sonnet 4.5 and competition on our internal benchmarks, using fewer tokens to solve the same problems. At scale, that efficiency compounds.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivers frontier reasoning within Lovable's chat mode, where users plan and iterate on projects. Its reasoning depth transforms planning—and great planning makes code generation even better.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 excels at long-horizon, autonomous tasks, especially those that require sustained reasoning and multi-step execution. In our evaluations it handled complex workflows with fewer dead-ends. On Terminal Bench it delivered a 15% improvement over Sonnet 4.5, a meaningful gain that becomes especially clear when using Warp’s Planning Mode.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 achieved state-of-the-art results for complex enterprise tasks on our benchmarks, outperforming previous models on multi-step reasoning tasks that combine information retrieval, tool use, and deep analysis.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivers measurable gains where it matters most: stronger results on our hardest evaluations and consistent performance through 30-minute autonomous coding sessions.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 represents a breakthrough in self-improving AI agents. For office automation, our agents were able to autonomously refine their own capabilities—achieving peak performance in 4 iterations while other models couldn’t match that quality after 10.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is a notable improvement over the prior Claude models inside Cursor, with improved pricing and intelligence on difficult coding tasks.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is yet another example of Anthropic pushing the frontier of general intelligence. It performs exceedingly well across difficult coding tasks, showcasing long-term goal-directed behavior.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 delivered an impressive refactor spanning two codebases and three coordinated agents. It was very thorough, helping develop a robust plan, handling the details and fixing tests. A clear step forward from Sonnet 4.5.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 handles long-horizon coding tasks more efficiently than any model we’ve tested. It achieves higher pass rates on held-out tests while using up to 65% fewer tokens, giving developers real cost control without sacrificing quality.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;We’ve found that Opus 4.5 excels at interpreting what users actually want, producing shareable content on the first try. Combined with its speed, token efficiency, and surprisingly low cost, it’s the first time we’re making Opus available in Notion Agent.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 excels at long-context storytelling, generating 10-15 page chapters with strong organization and consistency. It's unlocked use cases we couldn't reliably deliver before.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 sets a new standard for Excel automation and financial modeling. Accuracy on our internal evals improved 20%, efficiency rose 15%, and complex tasks that once seemed out of reach became achievable.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is the only model that nails some of our hardest 3D visualizations. Polished design, tasteful UX, and excellent planning &amp;amp; orchestration - all with more efficient token usage. Tasks that took previous models 2 hours now take thirty minutes.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 catches more issues in code reviews without sacrificing precision. For production code review at scale, that reliability matters.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Based on testing with Junie, our coding agent, Claude Opus 4.5 outperforms Sonnet 4.5 across all benchmarks. It requires fewer steps to solve tasks and uses fewer tokens as a result. This indicates that the new model is more precise and follows instructions more effectively — a direction we’re very excited about.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The effort parameter is brilliant. Claude Opus 4.5 feels dynamic rather than overthinking, and at lower effort delivers the same quality we need while being dramatically more efficient. That control is exactly what our SQL workflows demand.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;We’re seeing 50% to 75% reductions in both tool calling errors and build/lint errors with Claude Opus 4.5. It consistently finishes complex tasks in fewer iterations with more reliable execution.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.5 is smooth, with none of the rough edges we've seen from other frontier models. The speed improvements are remarkable.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluating Claude Opus 4.5&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We give prospective performance engineering candidates a notoriously difficult take-home exam. We also test new models on this exam as an internal benchmark. Within our prescribed 2-hour time limit, Claude Opus 4.5 scored higher than any human candidate ever1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The take-home test is designed to assess technical ability and judgment under time pressure. It doesn’t test for other crucial skills candidates may possess, like collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years. But this result—where an AI model outperforms strong candidates on important technical skills—raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession. Our Societal Impacts and Economic Futures research is aimed at understanding these kinds of changes across many fields. We plan to share more results soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software engineering isn’t the only area on which Claude Opus 4.5 has improved. Capabilities are higher across the board—Opus 4.5 has better vision, reasoning, and mathematics skills than its predecessors, and it is state-of-the-art in many domains:2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s capabilities outpace some of the benchmarks we use in our tests. A common benchmark for agentic capabilities is τ2-bench, which measures the performance of agents in real-world, multi-turn tasks. In one scenario, models have to act as an airline service agent helping a distressed customer. The benchmark expects models to refuse a modification to a basic economy booking since the airline doesn’t allow changes to that class of tickets. Instead, Opus 4.5 found an insightful (and legitimate) way to solve the problem: upgrade the cabin first, then modify the flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Let me think about what options I have within my policy:

1. Modify flights - Basic economy cannot be modified. This is clear in the policy.
2. Change cabin - Wait, let me check this option! The policy says:
"In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights."

But he wants to change the flights, not just the cabin. However, what if we:
- Change the cabin first (which IS allowed for basic economy), then
- Change the flights (which is allowed for non-basic economy)

So the strategy could be:
1. Upgrade his cabin from basic economy to economy (or business)
2. Then modify the flights to be 2 days later

This would cost more money, but it’s a legitimate path within the policy!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark technically scored this as a failure because Claude’s way of helping the customer was unanticipated. But this kind of creative problem solving is exactly what we’ve heard about from our testers and customers—it’s what makes Claude Opus 4.5 feel like a meaningful step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other contexts, finding clever paths around intended constraints could count as reward hacking—where models “game” rules or objectives in unintended ways. Preventing such misalignment is one of the objectives of our safety testing, discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A step forward on safety&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we state in our system card, Claude Opus 4.5 is the most robustly aligned model we have released to date and, we suspect, the best-aligned frontier model by any developer. It continues our trend towards safer and more secure models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our customers often use Claude for critical tasks. They want to be assured that, in the face of malicious attacks by hackers and cybercriminals, Claude has the training and the “street smarts” to avoid trouble. With Opus 4.5, we’ve made substantial progress in robustness against prompt injection attacks, which smuggle in deceptive instructions to fool the model into harmful behavior. Opus 4.5 is harder to trick with prompt injection than any other frontier model in the industry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find a detailed description of all our capability and safety evaluations in the Claude Opus 4.5 system card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New on the Claude Developer Platform&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As models get smarter, they can solve problems in fewer steps: less backtracking, less redundant exploration, less verbose reasoning. Claude Opus 4.5 uses dramatically fewer tokens than its predecessors to reach similar or better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But different tasks call for different tradeoffs. Sometimes developers want a model to keep thinking about a problem; sometimes they want something more nimble. With our new effort parameter on the Claude API, you can decide to minimize time and spend or maximize capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set to a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5’s best score on SWE-bench Verified, but uses 76% fewer output tokens. At its highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points—while using 48% fewer tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With effort control, context compaction, and advanced tool use, Claude Opus 4.5 runs longer, does more, and requires less intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our context management and memory capabilities can dramatically boost performance on agentic tasks. Opus 4.5 is also very effective at managing a team of subagents, enabling the construction of complex, well-coordinated multi-agent systems. In our testing, the combination of all these techniques boosted Opus 4.5’s performance on a deep research evaluation by almost 15 percentage points4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re making our Developer Platform more composable over time. We want to give you the building blocks to construct exactly what you need, with full control over efficiency, tool use, and context management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product updates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Products like Claude Code show what’s possible when the kinds of upgrades we’ve made to the Claude Developer Platform come together. Claude Code gains two upgrades with Opus 4.5. Plan Mode now builds more precise plans and executes more thoroughly—Claude asks clarifying questions upfront, then builds a user-editable plan.md file before executing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Code is also now available in our desktop app, letting you run multiple local and remote sessions in parallel: perhaps one agent fixes bugs, another researches GitHub, and a third updates docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Claude app users, long conversations no longer hit a wall—Claude automatically summarizes earlier context as needed, so you can keep the chat going. Claude for Chrome, which lets Claude handle tasks across your browser tabs, is now available to all Max users. We announced Claude for Excel in October, and as of today we've expanded beta access to all Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Each of these updates takes advantage of Claude Opus 4.5’s market-leading performance in using computers, spreadsheets, and handling long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Claude and Claude Code users with access to Opus 4.5, we’ve removed Opus-specific caps. For Max and Team Premium users, we’ve increased overall usage limits, meaning you’ll have roughly the same number of Opus tokens as you previously had with Sonnet. We’re updating usage limits to make sure you’re able to use Opus 4.5 for daily work. These limits are specific to Opus 4.5. As future models surpass it, we expect to update limits as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;1: This result was using parallel test-time compute, a method that aggregates multiple “tries” from the model and selects from among them. Without a time limit, the model (used within Claude Code) matched the best-ever human candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2: We improved the hosting environment to reduce infrastructure failures. This change improved Gemini 3 to 56.7% and GPT-5.1 to 48.6% from the values reported by their developers, using the Terminus-2 harness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3: Note that these evaluations were run on an in-progress upgrade to Petri, our open-source, automated evaluation tool. They were run on an earlier snapshot of Claude Opus 4.5. Evaluations of the final production model show a very similar pattern of results when compared to other Claude models, and are described in detail in the Claude Opus 4.5 system card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4: A fetch-enabled version of BrowseComp-Plus. Specifically, the improvement was from 70.48% without using the combination of techniques to 85.30% using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All evals were run with a 64K thinking budget, interleaved scratchpads, 200K context window, default effort (high), default sampling settings (temperature, top_p), and averaged over 5 independent trials. Exceptions: SWE-bench Verified (no thinking budget) and Terminal Bench (128K thinking budget). Please see the Claude Opus 4.5 system card for full details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Related content&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude now available in Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot&lt;/head&gt;Read more&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Anthropic announce strategic partnerships&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, NVIDIA and Anthropic announced new strategic partnerships.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of AI agents is one where models work seamlessly across hundreds or thousands of tools. An IDE assistant that integrates git operations, file manipulation, package managers, testing frameworks, and deployment pipelines. An operations coordinator that connects Slack, GitHub, Google Drive, Jira, company databases, and dozens of MCP servers simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build effective agents, they need to work with unlimited tool libraries without stuffing every definition into context upfront. Our blog article on using code execution with MCP discussed how tool results and definitions can sometimes consume 50,000+ tokens before an agent reads a request. Agents should discover and load tools on-demand, keeping only what's relevant for the current task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents also need the ability to call tools from code. When using natural language tool calling, each invocation requires a full inference pass, and intermediate results pile up in context whether they're useful or not. Code is a natural fit for orchestration logic, such as loops, conditionals, and data transformations. Agents need the flexibility to choose between code execution and inference based on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents also need to learn correct tool usage from examples, not just schema definitions. JSON schemas define what's structurally valid, but can't express usage patterns: when to include optional parameters, which combinations make sense, or what conventions your API expects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're releasing three features that make this possible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool Search Tool, which allows Claude to use search tools to access thousands of tools without consuming its context window&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Programmatic Tool Calling, which allows Claude to invoke tools in a code execution environment reducing the impact on the model’s context window&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool Use Examples, which provides a universal standard for demonstrating how to effectively use a given tool&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In internal testing, we’ve found these features have helped us build things that wouldn’t have been possible with conventional tool use patterns. For example, Claude for Excel uses Programmatic Tool Calling to read and modify spreadsheets with thousands of rows without overloading the model’s context window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our experience, we believe these features open up new possibilities for what you can build with Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tool Search Tool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MCP tool definitions provide important context, but as more servers connect, those tokens can add up. Consider a five-server setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GitHub: 35 tools (~26K tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slack: 11 tools (~21K tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sentry: 5 tools (~3K tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grafana: 5 tools (~3K tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Splunk: 2 tools (~2K tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's 58 tools consuming approximately 55K tokens before the conversation even starts. Add more servers like Jira (which alone uses ~17K tokens) and you're quickly approaching 100K+ token overhead. At Anthropic, we've seen tool definitions consume 134K tokens before optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But token cost isn't the only issue. The most common failures are wrong tool selection and incorrect parameters, especially when tools have similar names like &lt;code&gt;notification-send-user&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;notification-send-channel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our solution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of loading all tool definitions upfront, the Tool Search Tool discovers tools on-demand. Claude only sees the tools it actually needs for the current task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All tool definitions loaded upfront (~72K tokens for 50+ MCP tools)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conversation history and system prompt compete for remaining space&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Total context consumption: ~77K tokens before any work begins&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Tool Search Tool:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only the Tool Search Tool loaded upfront (~500 tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools discovered on-demand as needed (3-5 relevant tools, ~3K tokens)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Total context consumption: ~8.7K tokens, preserving 95% of context window&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This represents an 85% reduction in token usage while maintaining access to your full tool library. Internal testing showed significant accuracy improvements on MCP evaluations when working with large tool libraries. Opus 4 improved from 49% to 74%, and Opus 4.5 improved from 79.5% to 88.1% with Tool Search Tool enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How the Tool Search Tool works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tool Search Tool lets Claude dynamically discover tools instead of loading all definitions upfront. You provide all your tool definitions to the API, but mark tools with &lt;code&gt;defer_loading: true&lt;/code&gt; to make them discoverable on-demand. Deferred tools aren't loaded into Claude's context initially. Claude only sees the Tool Search Tool itself plus any tools with &lt;code&gt;defer_loading: false&lt;/code&gt; (your most critical, frequently-used tools).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Claude needs specific capabilities, it searches for relevant tools. The Tool Search Tool returns references to matching tools, which get expanded into full definitions in Claude's context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if Claude needs to interact with GitHub, it searches for "github," and only &lt;code&gt;github.createPullRequest&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;github.listIssues&lt;/code&gt; get loaded—not your other 50+ tools from Slack, Jira, and Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This way, Claude has access to your full tool library while only paying the token cost for tools it actually needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "tools": [
    // Include a tool search tool (regex, BM25, or custom)
    {"type": "tool_search_tool_regex_20251119", "name": "tool_search_tool_regex"},

    // Mark tools for on-demand discovery
    {
      "name": "github.createPullRequest",
      "description": "Create a pull request",
      "input_schema": {...},
      "defer_loading": true
    }
    // ... hundreds more deferred tools with defer_loading: true
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For MCP servers, you can defer loading entire servers while keeping specific high-use tools loaded:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "type": "mcp_toolset",
  "mcp_server_name": "google-drive",
  "default_config": {"defer_loading": true}, # defer loading the entire server
  "configs": {
    "search_files": {
"defer_loading": false
    }  // Keep most used tool loaded
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claude Developer Platform provides regex-based and BM25-based search tools out of the box, but you can also implement custom search tools using embeddings or other strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When to use the Tool Search Tool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like any architectural decision, enabling the Tool Search Tool involves trade-offs. The feature adds a search step before tool invocation, so it delivers the best ROI when the context savings and accuracy improvements outweigh additional latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use it when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool definitions consuming &amp;gt;10K tokens&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experiencing tool selection accuracy issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building MCP-powered systems with multiple servers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10+ tools available&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less beneficial when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small tool library (&amp;lt;10 tools)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All tools used frequently in every session&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool definitions are compact&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Programmatic Tool Calling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional tool calling creates two fundamental problems as workflows become more complex:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context pollution from intermediate results: When Claude analyzes a 10MB log file for error patterns, the entire file enters its context window, even though Claude only needs a summary of error frequencies. When fetching customer data across multiple tables, every record accumulates in context regardless of relevance. These intermediate results consume massive token budgets and can push important information out of the context window entirely.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inference overhead and manual synthesis: Each tool call requires a full model inference pass. After receiving results, Claude must "eyeball" the data to extract relevant information, reason about how pieces fit together, and decide what to do next—all through natural language processing. A five tool workflow means five inference passes plus Claude parsing each result, comparing values, and synthesizing conclusions. This is both slow and error-prone.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our solution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programmatic Tool Calling enables Claude to orchestrate tools through code rather than through individual API round-trips. Instead of Claude requesting tools one at a time with each result being returned to its context, Claude writes code that calls multiple tools, processes their outputs, and controls what information actually enters its context window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude excels at writing code and by letting it express orchestration logic in Python rather than through natural language tool invocations, you get more reliable, precise control flow. Loops, conditionals, data transformations, and error handling are all explicit in code rather than implicit in Claude's reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Example: Budget compliance check&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a common business task: "Which team members exceeded their Q3 travel budget?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have three tools available:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_team_members(department)&lt;/code&gt;- Returns team member list with IDs and levels&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_expenses(user_id, quarter)&lt;/code&gt;- Returns expense line items for a user&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_budget_by_level(level)&lt;/code&gt;- Returns budget limits for an employee level&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch team members → 20 people&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each person, fetch their Q3 expenses → 20 tool calls, each returning 50-100 line items (flights, hotels, meals, receipts)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch budget limits by employee level&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All of this enters Claude's context: 2,000+ expense line items (50 KB+)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude manually sums each person's expenses, looks up their budget, compares expenses against budget limits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More round-trips to the model, significant context consumption&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Programmatic Tool Calling:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of each tool result returning to Claude, Claude writes a Python script that orchestrates the entire workflow. The script runs in the Code Execution tool (a sandboxed environment), pausing when it needs results from your tools. When you return tool results via the API, they're processed by the script rather than consumed by the model. The script continues executing, and Claude only sees the final output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what Claude's orchestration code looks like for the budget compliance task:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;team = await get_team_members("engineering")

# Fetch budgets for each unique level
levels = list(set(m["level"] for m in team))
budget_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    get_budget_by_level(level) for level in levels
])

# Create a lookup dictionary: {"junior": budget1, "senior": budget2, ...}
budgets = {level: budget for level, budget in zip(levels, budget_results)}

# Fetch all expenses in parallel
expenses = await asyncio.gather(*[
    get_expenses(m["id"], "Q3") for m in team
])

# Find employees who exceeded their travel budget
exceeded = []
for member, exp in zip(team, expenses):
    budget = budgets[member["level"]]
    total = sum(e["amount"] for e in exp)
    if total &amp;gt; budget["travel_limit"]:
        exceeded.append({
            "name": member["name"],
            "spent": total,
            "limit": budget["travel_limit"]
        })

print(json.dumps(exceeded))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's context receives only the final result: the two to three people who exceeded their budget. The 2,000+ line items, the intermediate sums, and the budget lookups do not affect Claude’s context, reducing consumption from 200KB of raw expense data to just 1KB of results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The efficiency gains are substantial:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Token savings: By keeping intermediate results out of Claude's context, PTC dramatically reduces token consumption. Average usage dropped from 43,588 to 27,297 tokens, a 37% reduction on complex research tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduced latency: Each API round-trip requires model inference (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds). When Claude orchestrates 20+ tool calls in a single code block, you eliminate 19+ inference passes. The API handles tool execution without returning to the model each time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Improved accuracy: By writing explicit orchestration logic, Claude makes fewer errors than when juggling multiple tool results in natural language. Internal knowledge retrieval improved from 25.6% to 28.5%; GIA benchmarks from 46.5% to 51.2%.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Production workflows involve messy data, conditional logic, and operations that need to scale. Programmatic Tool Calling lets Claude handle that complexity programmatically while keeping its focus on actionable results rather than raw data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Programmatic Tool Calling works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;1. Mark tools as callable from code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add code_execution to tools, and set allowed_callers to opt-in tools for programmatic execution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "code_execution_20250825",
      "name": "code_execution"
    },
    {
      "name": "get_team_members",
      "description": "Get all members of a department...",
      "input_schema": {...},
      "allowed_callers": ["code_execution_20250825"] # opt-in to programmatic tool calling
    },
    {
      "name": "get_expenses",
 	...
    },
    {
      "name": "get_budget_by_level",
	...
    }
  ]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The API converts these tool definitions into Python functions that Claude can call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;2. Claude writes orchestration code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of requesting tools one at a time, Claude generates Python code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "type": "server_tool_use",
  "id": "srvtoolu_abc",
  "name": "code_execution",
  "input": {
    "code": "team = get_team_members('engineering')\n..." # the code example above
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;3. Tools execute without hitting Claude's context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the code calls get_expenses(), you receive a tool request with a caller field:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "id": "toolu_xyz",
  "name": "get_expenses",
  "input": {"user_id": "emp_123", "quarter": "Q3"},
  "caller": {
    "type": "code_execution_20250825",
    "tool_id": "srvtoolu_abc"
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You provide the result, which is processed in the Code Execution environment rather than Claude's context. This request-response cycle repeats for each tool call in the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;4. Only final output enters context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the code finishes running, only the results of the code are returned to Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "type": "code_execution_tool_result",
  "tool_use_id": "srvtoolu_abc",
  "content": {
    "stdout": "[{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"spent\": 12500, \"limit\": 10000}...]"
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all Claude sees, not the 2000+ expense line items processed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When to use Programmatic Tool Calling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programmatic Tool Calling adds a code execution step to your workflow. This extra overhead pays off when the token savings, latency improvements, and accuracy gains are substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most beneficial when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Processing large datasets where you only need aggregates or summaries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running multi-step workflows with three or more dependent tool calls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filtering, sorting, or transforming tool results before Claude sees them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Handling tasks where intermediate data shouldn't influence Claude's reasoning&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running parallel operations across many items (checking 50 endpoints, for example)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less beneficial when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Making simple single-tool invocations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Working on tasks where Claude should see and reason about all intermediate results&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running quick lookups with small responses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tool Use Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The challenge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON Schema excels at defining structure–types, required fields, allowed enums–but it can't express usage patterns: when to include optional parameters, which combinations make sense, or what conventions your API expects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a support ticket API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "name": "create_ticket",
  "input_schema": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {"type": "string"},
      "priority": {"enum": ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]},
      "labels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
      "reporter": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "id": {"type": "string"},
          "name": {"type": "string"},
          "contact": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "email": {"type": "string"},
              "phone": {"type": "string"}
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "due_date": {"type": "string"},
      "escalation": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "level": {"type": "integer"},
          "notify_manager": {"type": "boolean"},
          "sla_hours": {"type": "integer"}
        }
      }
    },
    "required": ["title"]
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The schema defines what's valid, but leaves critical questions unanswered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Format ambiguity: Should &lt;code&gt;due_date&lt;/code&gt;use "2024-11-06", "Nov 6, 2024", or "2024-11-06T00:00:00Z"?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ID conventions: Is &lt;code&gt;reporter.id&lt;/code&gt;a UUID, "USR-12345", or just "12345"?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nested structure usage: When should Claude populate &lt;code&gt;reporter.contact&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameter correlations: How do &lt;code&gt;escalation.level&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;escalation.sla_hours&lt;/code&gt;relate to priority?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These ambiguities can lead to malformed tool calls and inconsistent parameter usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our solution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tool Use Examples let you provide sample tool calls directly in your tool definitions. Instead of relying on schema alone, you show Claude concrete usage patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
    "name": "create_ticket",
    "input_schema": { /* same schema as above */ },
    "input_examples": [
      {
        "title": "Login page returns 500 error",
        "priority": "critical",
        "labels": ["bug", "authentication", "production"],
        "reporter": {
          "id": "USR-12345",
          "name": "Jane Smith",
          "contact": {
            "email": "jane@acme.com",
            "phone": "+1-555-0123"
          }
        },
        "due_date": "2024-11-06",
        "escalation": {
          "level": 2,
          "notify_manager": true,
          "sla_hours": 4
        }
      },
      {
        "title": "Add dark mode support",
        "labels": ["feature-request", "ui"],
        "reporter": {
          "id": "USR-67890",
          "name": "Alex Chen"
        }
      },
      {
        "title": "Update API documentation"
      }
    ]
  }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these three examples, Claude learns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Format conventions: Dates use YYYY-MM-DD, user IDs follow USR-XXXXX, labels use kebab-case&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nested structure patterns: How to construct the reporter object with its nested contact object&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optional parameter correlations: Critical bugs have full contact info + escalation with tight SLAs; feature requests have reporter but no contact/escalation; internal tasks have title only&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our own internal testing, tool use examples improved accuracy from 72% to 90% on complex parameter handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;When to use Tool Use Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tool Use Examples add tokens to your tool definitions, so they’re most valuable when accuracy improvements outweigh the additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most beneficial when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Complex nested structures where valid JSON doesn't imply correct usage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools with many optional parameters and inclusion patterns matter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;APIs with domain-specific conventions not captured in schemas&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Similar tools where examples clarify which one to use (e.g., &lt;code&gt;create_ticket&lt;/code&gt;vs&lt;code&gt;create_incident&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less beneficial when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple single-parameter tools with obvious usage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Standard formats like URLs or emails that Claude already understands&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Validation concerns better handled by JSON Schema constraints&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Best practices&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building agents that take real-world actions means handling scale, complexity, and precision simultaneously. These three features work together to solve different bottlenecks in tool use workflows. Here's how to combine them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer features strategically&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every agent needs to use all three features for a given task. Start with your biggest bottleneck:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context bloat from tool definitions → Tool Search Tool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large intermediate results polluting context → Programmatic Tool Calling&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameter errors and malformed calls → Tool Use Examples&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This focused approach lets you address the specific constraint limiting your agent's performance, rather than adding complexity upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then layer additional features as needed. They're complementary: Tool Search Tool ensures the right tools are found, Programmatic Tool Calling ensures efficient execution, and Tool Use Examples ensure correct invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Set up Tool Search Tool for better discovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tool search matches against names and descriptions, so clear, descriptive definitions improve discovery accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Good
{
    "name": "search_customer_orders",
    "description": "Search for customer orders by date range, status, or total amount. Returns order details including items, shipping, and payment info."
}

// Bad
{
    "name": "query_db_orders",
    "description": "Execute order query"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add system prompt guidance so Claude knows what's available:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;You have access to tools for Slack messaging, Google Drive file management, 
Jira ticket tracking, and GitHub repository operations. Use the tool search 
to find specific capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep your three to five most-used tools always loaded, defer the rest. This balances immediate access for common operations with on-demand discovery for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Set up Programmatic Tool Calling for correct execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Claude writes code to parse tool outputs, document return formats clearly. This helps Claude write correct parsing logic:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
    "name": "get_orders",
    "description": "Retrieve orders for a customer.
Returns:
    List of order objects, each containing:
    - id (str): Order identifier
    - total (float): Order total in USD
    - status (str): One of 'pending', 'shipped', 'delivered'
    - items (list): Array of {sku, quantity, price}
    - created_at (str): ISO 8601 timestamp"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See below for opt-in tools that benefit from programmatic orchestration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tools that can run in parallel (independent operations)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Operations safe to retry (idempotent)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Set up Tool Use Examples for parameter accuracy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Craft examples for behavioral clarity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use realistic data (real city names, plausible prices, not "string" or "value")&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Show variety with minimal, partial, and full specification patterns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep it concise: 1-5 examples per tool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Focus on ambiguity (only add examples where correct usage isn't obvious from schema)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;SSDs have all but replaced hard drives when it comes to primary storage. They're orders of magnitude faster, more convenient, and consume less power than mechanical hard drives. That said, if you're also using SSDs for cold storage, expecting the drives lying in your drawer to work perfectly after years, you might want to rethink your strategy. Your reliable SSD could suffer from corrupted or lost data if left unpowered for extended periods. This is why many users don't consider SSDs a reliable long-term storage medium, and prefer using hard drives, magnetic tape, or M-Disc instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your SSD data isn't as permanent as you think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Non-volatile with an asterisk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike hard drives that magnetize spinning discs to store data, SSDs modify the electrical charge in NAND flash cells to represent 0 and 1. NAND flash retains data in underlying transistors even when power is removed, similar to other forms of non-volatile memory. However, the duration for which your SSD can retain data without power is the key here. Even the cheapest SSDs, say those with QLC NAND, can safely store data for about a year of being completely unpowered. More expensive TLC NAND can retain data for up to 3 years, while MLC and SLC NAND are good for 5 years and 10 years of unpowered storage, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is that most consumer SSDs use only TLC or QLC NAND, so users who leave their SSDs unpowered for over a year are risking the integrity of their data. The reliability of QLC NAND has improved over the years, so you should probably consider 2–3 years of unpowered usage as the guardrails. Without power, the voltage stored in the NAND cells can be lost, either resulting in missing data or completely useless drives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This data retention deficiency of consumer SSDs makes them an unreliable medium for long-term data storage, especially for creative professionals and researchers. HDDs can suffer from bit rot, too, due to wear and tear, but they're still more resistant to power loss. If you haven't checked your archives in a while, I'd recommend doing so at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But, most people don't need to worry about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Archival storage isn't that common&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scenario I described above isn't relevant to people outside enterprise, enthusiast, and solopreneur usage. The need to store tons of data for years on drives that aren't plugged in isn't a concern for most people, who use one or two SSDs on their PC that might be left without power for only a few months, at the maximum. You've probably lost data on your SSD due to a rare power surge or a faulty drive rather than voltage loss. Some factors, like temperature and the quality of the underlying NAND flash, can accelerate this voltage loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSDs aren't eternal, even if you keep them powered on forever. The limited write cycles of NAND flash will eventually bring an SSD to the end of its lifecycle, but the majority of users will probably replace the drive before that ever happens. So, you don't need to worry about writing too much data to your SSD or leaving your PC turned off for days, weeks, or even months. Just don't trust an unpowered SSD that's gathering dust in the house for years, which brings me to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You should always have a backup anyway&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Prevention is better than cure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backing up your data is the simplest strategy to counteract the limitations of storage media. Having multiple copies of your data on different types of storage ensures that any unexpected incidents protect your data from vanishing forever. This is exactly what the 3-2-1 backup rule talks about: 3 copies of data on at least 2 different storage media, with 1 copy stored off-site. For most people, this condition can easily be fulfilled by using their primary computer, a NAS, and cloud storage. Redundancy is the underlying principle that safeguards your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether it's the limited lifespan of your SSD, the potential for harmful exigencies like power failure, or the limits of data retention on flash storage, your backup will ensure your peace of mind. Yes, SSDs aren't the best choice for cold storage, but even if you're using hard drives, having a single copy of your data is asking for trouble. Every user will come face-to-face with drive failure sooner or later, so investing in a robust backup system isn't really optional if you care about your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Store it and forget it doesn't work for SSDs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As long as you're using consumer SSDs for primary storage on your PC, it's all well and good. You'll most likely replace your drive long before exhausting its P/E cycles. For long-term storage, however, relying on SSDs is risky, since they can lose data if left without power for years. This data loss can occur anytime from 1 to 3 years of keeping your SSDs unpowered, so using alternate storage media and investing in a backup system should be your priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

RAM jumps to $600 due to shortage</title><updated>2025-11-24T23:36:10.382842+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="1b6a48b58eb6e785"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;An entire PS5 now costs less than 64GB of DDR5 memory, even after a discount — simple memory kit jumps to $600 due to DRAM shortage, and it's expected to get worse into 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the AI boom devouring the majority of the world's memory and storage supply, end-consumers are now facing increasingly inflated prices for common components. DDR5 RAM, a necessity for building current-gen Intel or AMD systems, has now reached record highs in terms of pricing; a 64 GB kit of G.Skill's Trident Z5 Neo 6000 MT/s RAM is listed at $599.99 on Newegg right now — that's $200 more than a PS5 Slim or a Microsoft Xbox Series S, and just $50 shy off an entire PS5 Pro at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB Series 64GB DDR5 6000 (PC5 48000)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;($599 in Black Friday sale, with $40 off and additional $20 off via code BFE2458)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Row 1 - Cell 2&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Row 2 - Cell 2&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Row 3 - Cell 2&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Row 4 - Cell 2&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Row 5 - Cell 2&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That $600 price tag has a 6% discount already applied to its original $640 ask, as part of a Black Friday deal. For context, a more exclusive 64 GB limited edition Corsair Dominator Titanium kit cost only $349 when we reviewed it a few months ago. Earlier this year, we posted about DDR5 deals on Prime Day where the standard edition of the same kit was just $299, and you could get other comparable 64 GB kits for as low as $140.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick glance at price tracking data, and G.Skill's Trident Z5 Neo kit has regularly sat at $205-$220 for the past few months, and it was only in late October that it started to pick up steam. From September 20th when it was listed at $220, to $640 now. In just 2 months we've witnessed an astounding ~190% surge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right as this particular Trident Z5 Neo kit began to skyrocket in price was when the industry first started to pick up on the affects of the AI crunch. A few days later we published our initial coverage on DDR5 RAM price hikes; from there, the situation has only worsened to reach worrying levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Insane mark-up aside, the kit itself is one of the best on the market, recommend as the top pick for DDR5 memory in our roundup. Unfortunately, it seems like high prices are going to be the story going forward. The surge in demand for AI projects will see production lines will prioritizing serving AI clients, leaving consumers to pay through the nose or make the best of what they have. Experts speculate that both DRAM and NAND constraints will become normal throughout 2026 as Big Tech looks to pursue AGI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, hard drives are vanishing from store shelves to the point where microSD cards are serving as a feasible replacement for them. Large-capacity nearline HDDs are backordered for 2 years, as a result of which QLC SSDs are now being swept up at alarming rates. Many distributors are even selling memory and motherboards bundled together to combat the global shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even Valve's upcoming Steam Machine will end up costing more than expected due to the production window of the device aligning with the DRAM crisis. That being said, memory has almost always lived in a rollercoaster cycle, with manufacturers oversupplying for a couple of years, then undersupplying for the next few. Looking at it optimistically, you're probably going to find DDR5 at bargain prices again in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
