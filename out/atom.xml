    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The ABS programming language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring back the joy of shell scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A familiar syntax&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ABS should look familiar to most of us, as its elements are borrowed from popular programming languages such as Ruby, Python or JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;obj = {} 
for n in 1..10 {     
  if n % 2 == 0 { 
    obj[n.str()] = rand(6**2) 
  } 
} 
echo("We have %s", obj)  
# We have {"10": 79, ...}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scripting made easy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System commands are deeply integrated (and encouraged); they make ABS ideal to work with in the context of shell scripting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ip = `curl icanhazip.com`

ip.ok // true
ip // 1.2.3.4

echo("type something...")
input = stdin()
echo("you typed %s",input)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Easy to run&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grab the latest release, run &lt;code&gt;abs your_script.abs&lt;/code&gt; and see the magic happening. ABS works on Mac, Windows and Linux:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ abs test.abs 

1.2.3.4

type something...
Hello world!
you typed Hello world!
$&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Geolocation and Starlink &lt;lb/&gt; September 2025 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Where are you?" is not an easy question to answer on the Internet. The telephone system's address plan embedded a certain amount of physical location information in the fixed line network, and a full E.164 telephone number indicated your location in terms of your country, and your area within that country. The Internet did not adopt a geographic address plan which means that you're going to need a lot of additional information if you want to map an IP address into a location at the level of a country or a city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating and maintaining such collections of geolocation data that maps IP addresses to a geolocation presents some challenges. Even a basic question, such as "How are you going to represent a location?" has a variety of answers. One could use latitude and longitude, but this has its own complications. What if you just wanted to map addresses into countries? You need a representation of a political map to translate these coordinates into a country. Or you could avoid these multiple layers of indirection and simply map IP addresses into countries. However, once you start referring to countries you run into a new set of questions, starting with the most basic ones of "What's a country?" and "What's a uniform way of naming them?" Thankfully these are not novel questions, and we can leverage the work of others to provide some answers here. These is the group that maintains the ISO 3166 standard, published by the International Organization for Standardisation that enumerates a list of codes of countries and dependant territories, using both 2 letter codes, three letter codes and three-digit numeric codes, all maintained by the imaginatively named "ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency," a group of 15 voting experts. There is also the United Nations Statistics Division, a body that maintains a number of related lists, including the "official" name of each country, a collection of numeric codes for each defined country, and a definition of a set of regions (groups of countries or groups of regions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are these geolocation databases useful? There are obvious uses in the ongoing fight against various form of cyber-attacks, trying to de-anonymise the identity and location of the attacker. This information is also used in attempting to enforce various intellectual property rights that are often assigned to rights holders on a country-by-country basis. And then there are statistical reports. Countries like to compare themselves to others. But even simple questions, such as "How many Internet users are in each country?" are challenging to answer without the underlying seed data of a geolocation database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of such IP address-to-location databases out there, but most are either private or only accessible on a subscription basis. In the research world many researchers have opted for the databases that are more generally available, and at APNIC labs for AP address-to-country mappings we rely on Maxmind and ipinfo.io. for this information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Regional Internet Registries also publish a two-letter country code in their IP number resource reports, and they are often used as a surrogate for IP-to-country mappings, but the data quality is low when assessed for quality as a source of geolocation information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason why is based on differing assumptions between the data recording function of the RIRs and the needs of the geolocation function. The RIRs record the country of the principal office of the entity that was the recipient of the resource assignment. It does not record where these address and AS numbers are actually deployed on the Internet. In many cases, where an entity operates within a single country or economy, the RIR-recorded country code corresponds with the country where the associated addresses are being used. In other cases, where the IP addresses and AS numbers are used in other countries, the RIRs provide no indication that this is the case for these number resources. Also, the granularity of the data in the RIR registry is at a level of allocation, but when an assigned address block is divided up by an address holder and used in multiple countries there is no ability in the RIR data recording formation to track this internal subdivision and diverse deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, it's not part of the RIRs' role to track where these number resources are being deployed. The RIRs' interest lies in accurately tracking who is assigned an address, and not where that address is being used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At APNIC Labs we have been investigating if the collection of data that we have assembled as part of the measurement work can be used to track the ISP market share within each national economy. We are interested in trying to measure the effective level of inter-ISP competition within each national economy. The base of this derived competition measurement is a notional count of end users that are served by each ISP that operates in a national economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The measurement process starts with the estimated current population in each country. The data we use is sourced from the United Nations Population Division. We use the mid-year population estimate from 2024 and apply the 2023-2024 growth rate to the period from mid 2024 to the present day to get an estimate of the current population of each country for this day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second data set we use is the proportion of the population of each country that are classed as Internet users. There are three possible sources for this data, the World Bank, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the CIA World Factbook. We use the ITU data by preference, but we cross check with the other two data sources for correlation..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combination of these data sets gives us an estimate of the current Internet user population per country. It should be noted that this is not the number of âsubscriptionsâ to a service, as it attempts to include the number of users behind each subscription. It also is supposed to avoid âdouble countingâ, so where a user is part of a broadband service and also has a mobile service, then the user is still only counted once as an âInternet userâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third component of the data is the ad presentation data of the APNIC measurement program. We use Google Ads to deliver some 35M individual ad impressions per day. We use a geolocation database to map each user who received an ad impression to a country, and use a local default-free BGP routing table to also map each user to their "home" network. At this point we have now assembled a set of "home" networks (origin AS numbers) and the geo-located country for each presented ad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this work we are making some pretty sweeping assumptions. These assumptions are somewhat questionable, but we've been forced to make them in the absence of generally available per-country data that is published by all countries in a timely and mutually consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first assumption is that Google's ad placement algorithms apply to all users within a given country uniformly. In defining the ad campaigns, we attempt to make the placement definitions as generic as possible, so that within each country the ad placements are roughly equivalent to a random sampling drawn from all users in that country. The implication of this assumption is that if an ISP has twice the number of users than another ISP in the same country, then its users will receive twice the number of ad impressions. This could be stated as: "The distribution of ad placement and the distribution of users across ISPs within any country are assumed to correlate."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second assumption is that each user uses a single ISP for Internet access. This is not necessarily the case. For example, a user may use a local mobile service provider for their mobile Internet access and Starlink for their broadband access. We also have a user in their workplace using their workplace's ISP and using a consumer ISP when they are at home. These days many users have multiple mobile connections, and it is unclear how these multiple access methods correlate to ad placement, and through that to our measurements. The conclusion is that we canât account for such situations and in uniquely assigning each user to a single ISP in a country we tend to underestimate the user count for each ISP in consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the uncertainties that follow from these two major assumptions, the results we generate have an inevitable level of uncertainty. Some individual comparisons of this data against other sources where we have access to ISP market share data in individual countries point to an overall level of uncertainty of up to 15% or so in our estimates of users per ISP. Large consumer ISPs are still reported as having a large user population in the generated data, but the data for small networks is very uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assumption of uniform distribution of ad placements across all ISPs within each country tends to fail where the number of placed ads in relation to the per-country user population is low. The best current example of this can be seen with the Russian Federation, where ad placement in this country has plummeted since February 2023 (a consequence of the hostilities between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine and associated western sanctions being placed on Russia).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another general assumption is that all users exist within a country. This assumption does not necessarily hold for users on international flights using onboard Internet services, nor for ships at sea. In general, this factor should be insignificant for this exercise, given that as a proportion of the world's 5 billion users (or thereabouts!) this category of users is very small and should not distort the results to any significant extent beyond the already noted estimate of a 15% uncertainty. But this general assessment does not hold when the ISP in question operates a service that is not constrained to any single country, such as a satellite-based service. Even so, when the satellite service operates as a wholesale service and provides connections as a service to ISPs, then this is not relevant to this form of measurement. If an ISP provides service in a country using IP addresses that are assigned to that ISP, then the conventional geolocation function will still provide usable results. The situation is different when the satellite operator provides its own retail services, using IP addresses that have been assigned to that satellite operator. This is the case for Starlink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic assumption here is that all IP addresses are used within a national realm. But this is not necessarily the case with users who are connected by a satellite service. What is the country when the IP service is provided to a ship on the high seas?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are always exceptions to any generalisation, and some country views that are generated in this manner just stretch credibility too far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take Yemen, for example. A country with an estimated population of 10M people and 3.4M Internet users. The method described above gave the following result at the end of September:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;0.02&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;46,919&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;AS13335&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CLOUDFLARENET&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;YE&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;28,647&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.27&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.01&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1,467&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This measurement result for Starlink in Yemen is dubious at best. It has been generated because over the past 60 days some 321,000 measurement advertisements originated from IP addresses that have been assigned to Starlink and Starlink's geodatabase geolocates these addresses to Yemen. The other three services providers appear to be the incumbent telco, Yemen Net, and a local ISP in Aden, Aden Net. The Cloudflare measurement is likely due to a combination of the local use of Apple's Private Data Relay and the Cloudflare's Warp product. Together, these three providers accounted for some 210,000 ad presentations over the same period. The result is that the algorithm we use assigned some 6M users in Yemen (or 60% of the countryâs Internet user population) to Starlink!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What factors might be at play here that would contribute to this anomalous result?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One potential factor is the volume of shipping in the Red Sea. These days it appears that the use of Starlink at sea is pretty much pervasive. A Starlink service is evidently a faster and cheaper communications service than that provided by Inmarsat and it has truly global reach. Given that the Starlink geolocatation data attempts to map every Starlink IP address into one country or another, even ships at sea using Starlink get assigned an IP address that is mapped to some piece of land. Some 60 ships a day use the Suez Canal, and while the transit time from the Indian Ocean to the mediterranean sea is a few days, it's still a stretch to claim that shipping crew use of Starlink services alone accounts for some 50,000 ad impressions per day. These numbers imply that the use of Starlink by shipping may be part of the factors at play here, but it may not be the only contributary factor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another potential factor is that it's possible that Starlink's geolocation data does not reflect reality. The Starlink availability map indicates that Starlink has obtained national regulatory approval to operate in Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Israel, Jordan and Somalia, but not in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. There have been persistent stories in a number of markets of Starlink resellers that set up a service in a country that has the necessary national regulatory approvals to use Starlink and then they ship the dish to a nearby location in a different country. It's an open question as to the extent this is taking place, and if so then it's certainly plausible to guess that users in Saudi Arabia are using Starlink services that are registered in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does Yemen really have 6M Starlink users? That is extremely unlikely. How many Starlink users is the country likely to have? In neighbouring Oman, Starlink has a far more modest 0.08% market share, according to this same measurement technique. I would be surprised if the actual figure for in-country Yemen users is all that different. For the Yemen data, the high number might well be the result of a high count of Starlink-using passing maritime traffic being attributed to Yemen, and also some component of cross-country usage from perhaps Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, nearby countries where Starlink appears not to have local regulatory approval as yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there other countries with a similar problem of apparent over-representation of Starlink users? The ad placement data, assigned to countries using the Starlink geolocatation data maps to 152 countries. In 21 instances, listed in Table 1, Starlink is used in more than 10% of the ad placement volumes, which looks to be somewhat questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of Svalbard other geolocation databases geolocate to Norway, whereas only the Starlink data set uses the SJ two-letter country code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saint Barthelmy, located in the Caribbean, is an overseas âcollectivityâ of France, with a population of some 9,000 people. Its former status was a commune as a part of Guadeloupe. While the Starlink geolocation database distinguishes between Guadeloupe and Saint Barthelmy, it appears that other databases do not draw a distinction between the two, hence the very high proportion of as placement in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is likely that the relatively high numbers of Starlink ad presentations in Tuvalu, Kiribati, Cook Islands. Marshall Islands, Saint Martin, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Micronesia are due to shipping and yachting traffic. The relatively low GDP per capita in these island nations would tend to indicate that Starlink services are unaffordable by such high percentages of the domestic population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink operates a Community Gateway service in Naru, and a traceroute to the IP address prefixes announced by this ISP (Cenpac, AS 5722) reveals a Starlink connection, presumably using inter-satellite laser link. The connections using Starlinkâs own IP addresses are presumably not part of Cenpac service, and these are likely to be an anomaly, presumably due to global roaming used by ships at sea. An examination of the routing tab le shows similar community gateways have been deployed for the Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation in Tuvalu, Tamaani in Northern Quebec in Canada and the for the Federated States of Micronesia Telecommunications Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also possible that these additional ad placements could include an aircraft element, as there have been reports of Starlink selling a mobile access service to aircraft in flight, but as with ships at sea there is no published data on the uptake of this class of Starlink users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of other anomalies in Table 1. Sudan and Myanmar both have a high ad placement rate, yet the Starlink access map indicates that the Starlink service is not available in either of these countries. If that is the case, then why does the Starlink geo data have IP address entries for both of these countries and why are so many ad placements being recorded from these IP addresses? In the case of Sudan, the Starlink gateway announcing these IP addresses is located in Mombasa in Keyna, and for Myanmar the relevant Starlink Gateway is located in Singapore. There are also high counts of ad placements for Starlink services that geolocate to Zimbabwe, Niger and Chad. The situation in the Cook Islands is potentially relevant here, where prior to regulatory approval to operate in the Cook Islands it was reported that domestic enterprises and some users were purchasing a Starlink service in New Zealand under a Roam Unlimited plan, and then shipping the equipment to the Cook Islands. There is no regulatory approval for Starlink to operate in South Africa, Namiba, Angola, and all of the countries in northern Africa and much of western Africa, and itâs likely that there is a similar use of Starlinkâs roaming services to circumvent these local regulatory issues and purchase a roaming service elsewhere and use in in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 20 of these 21 countries (the sole exception appears to be Pitcairn Islands) itâs highly likely that the inferred level of use of Starlink within these countries is inflated by these factors, and the resultant view of the domestic ISP market is skewed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of the use of satellite services for these global roaming services raises some basic questions about IP geolocation and its role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this about the end user's precise physical location on the surface of the planet? Or is this about the national boundaries we've drawn on this surface, and assigning every user into one of these countries? In this case do we need to use a new geolocation code (or codes) for locations at sea? Is "at sea" defined by the conventional 12 nautical mile sea boundary? Or is some other interpretation of a margin where a country has a territorial sea claim?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about ships in international waters? The conventional approach to ships at sea assert that the ship and its crew are subject to the laws of its flag state in international waters. What about aircraft in flight? It might appear that a similar situation to ships at sea may apply to aircraft in flight over international space, but a more commonly applied convention (the Tokyo Convention) is that the laws of the country of aircraft registration apply to an aircraft in flight for international flights irrespective of the location of the aircraft at any point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what is the geolocation of the occupants of that ship or flight when accessing the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a deeper assumption here concerning the behaviour of IP addresses. Does it even make sense to statically assign a geographic location to an IP address when the addressed device is in motion? What are the motivations for performing the location attribute assignment, and how can we implement the dynamic nature of such an assignment? There are no clear unambiguous answers to such questions, and perhaps that ambiguity reflects a common uncertainty that there is no clearly defined purpose for geolocation assignment in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At APNIC Labs we've decided to override the Starlink geolocation data that refers to the 20 countries listed above and instead assign an âunclassifiedâ designation to this part of the Starlink geolocation data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs not exactly a satisfying response to the problem, but it stops the distortion of the national measurements due to the increasing levels of usage of these satellite-based services for Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

The Google-zlib implementation provided in the challenge is not upstream; it’s a version with an arbitrary patch applied. Whereas typical open‑source exploit challenges ship a patch that clearly introduces a vulnerability, &lt;code&gt;webz&lt;/code&gt;’s Google-zlib patch appears—at first glance—to be a normal optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, the vulnerability in this Google-zlib can be found quickly via fuzzing. However, in this write‑up we’ll derive the precise root cause through source analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google-zlib codebase isn’t large, but it is quite tricky. Because it implements compression algorithms, manipulates data at the bit level, and contains optimizations that sacrifice readability, analysis can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// webz.c:L114

It’s simply a wrapper around Google-zlib. It receives raw Deflate-compressed data from the user and decompresses it using Google-zlib’s &lt;code&gt;inflate&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, we must identify vulnerabilities in the code that implements &lt;code&gt;inflate&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;inflate.c&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;inftrees.c&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;inffast.c&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;item&gt;inflate.c&lt;/item&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The core of the&lt;code&gt;inflate&lt;/code&gt;implementation. The&lt;code&gt;inflate&lt;/code&gt;function is a virtual finite-state machine, treating the given compressed data like opcodes for a virtual machine. As we’ll examine later, it processes compressed data in blocks.&lt;item&gt;inftrees.c&lt;/item&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;One of the compression techniques used in&lt;code&gt;Deflate&lt;/code&gt;is Huffman coding. To decode Huffman-coded data in the&lt;code&gt;inflate&lt;/code&gt;implementation, a Huffman table must be constructed;&lt;code&gt;inftrees.c&lt;/code&gt;contains that Huffman table construction code.&lt;item&gt;inffast.c&lt;/item&gt;&lt;code&gt;inffast.c&lt;/code&gt;contains&lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt;, a high-speed implementation of&lt;code&gt;inflate&lt;/code&gt;decoding. Under certain conditions,&lt;code&gt;inflate&lt;/code&gt;calls&lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt;to decode data.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;From 2c282408771115b3cf80eeb9572927b796ddea79 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

Subject: [PATCH] [google-zlib] Increase Huffman Table Size

The basic idea is to use a bigger root &amp;amp; secondary table for both
dists and lens, allowing us to avoid oversubscription chekcs.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google-zlib source shipped with the challenge contains a &lt;code&gt;0001-google-zlib-Increase-Huffman-Table-Size.patch&lt;/code&gt;. From that patch we can see the code has been modified as above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patch removes some checks in &lt;code&gt;inftrees.c&lt;/code&gt; and greatly increases the values of &lt;code&gt;ENOUGH_LENS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ENOUGH_DISTS&lt;/code&gt;. From the comments, the patch increases the sizes of Huffman tables and removes related checks to achieve a memory/speed tradeoff optimization. At this point we don’t yet know exactly what issues this introduces, but it’s clear the vulnerability will be related to Huffman tables and Huffman coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing the code, let’s review the Deflate compression algorithm. Deflate uses Huffman coding and the LZ77 algorithm to compress data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principle of the LZ77 algorithm is very simple: repeated data is replaced by (length, distance) pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ABCDEEABCDFF -&amp;gt; ABCDEE(4,6)FF&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The length is how many bytes to copy, and the distance is how far back from the current position the source data lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huffman coding is a bit more involved. The basic idea is to replace original data with compressed bit sequences. While the minimum unit of data is typically a byte (8 bits), replacing values with shorter bit sequences reduces size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ABABAAAABBBB (12 Byte, 96bit) -&amp;gt; 010100001111 ( 1.5 Byte, 12bit)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example there are only two symbols, A and B, which can be encoded with 1-bit Huffman codes (0 and 1). If there are more than two symbols, you obviously cannot compress them all with 1-bit codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A -&amp;gt; 00
B -&amp;gt; 01
C -&amp;gt; 10
D -&amp;gt; 110
E -&amp;gt; 111

ABCDABCEABC -&amp;gt; 000110110000110111&lt;/code&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shown, Huffman codes depend on the data being compressed, so to decode the compressed data, you need a table mapping {Huffman code : actual value}.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Huffman code cannot be the prefix of another Huffman code. For example, if 111 is a code, then 11 cannot be a code; since codes have variable length, a prefix collision like 1110 would be ambiguous—unclear whether it’s 111 + 0 or 11 + 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the minimum and maximum code lengths vary depending on the number of distinct data values. Huffman coding assigns shorter codes (e.g., 2 bits) to high-frequency values (A, B, C) and longer codes (e.g., 3 bits) to low-frequency values (D, E) to compress effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, consider this: if Deflate generates efficient Huffman codes tailored to the input, then the decoder needs the corresponding Huffman table to decode. Therefore, Deflate uses either fixed Huffman tables or dynamic Huffman tables depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed Huffman table&lt;/item&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Predefined in Deflate/Inflate. It doesn’t always give the most efficient compression for the data, but you don’t need to include a Huffman table in the final compressed stream.&lt;item&gt;Dynamic Huffman table&lt;/item&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Performs optimal Huffman coding for the given data, and includes in the final compressed data the Huffman table necessary to decode it.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s elaborate on “including the Huffman table in the final compressed data.” In the standard implementation, the Huffman table can be represented using only code lengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A -&amp;gt; 00

E -&amp;gt; 111&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than storing the entire codes as above, you can store just the code lengths:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A -&amp;gt; 2
B -&amp;gt; 2
C -&amp;gt; 2
D -&amp;gt; 3
E -&amp;gt; 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since actual Huffman codes have lengths in the range 3–15 bits, storing only lengths reduces the size of the embedded Huffman tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately from using code lengths to compress the Huffman table, Google‑zlib compresses the lengths themselves again using Huffman coding. We’ll discuss this in more detail during the source analysis below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;huffman_table['A'] = 2
huffman_table['B'] = 2
huffman_table['C'] = 2
huffman_table['D'] = 3
huffman_table['E'] = 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This works for a simple reason. A Huffman table is an array indexed by the original symbol. Assign the first 2-bit code 00 to A; then B gets 01, C gets 10, and so on. Using only lengths and order, all codes are recoverable. In other words, if Deflate assigns codes in order, Inflate can reconstruct them from just the lengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deflate uses Huffman coding not only for literal values (0–255), but also for the LZ77 (length, distance) pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;int ZEXPORT inflate(z_streamp strm, int flush) {

Then extract as many bits as needed with &lt;code&gt;BITS&lt;/code&gt;, and drop consumed bits with &lt;code&gt;DROPBITS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this bit-level handling, the code decodes the compressed data and appends the decoded bytes to &lt;code&gt;strm-&amp;gt;next_out&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt;), decreasing &lt;code&gt;strm-&amp;gt;avail_out&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;) by the number of bytes written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        case TYPEDO:

As noted earlier, a dynamic codes block includes a Code Huffman table, and compressed Literal/Length and Distance tables. The code above reads the lengths for those three tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Literal/Length table contains codes for literal bytes (A, B, …) and for LZ77 lengths; the Distance table holds codes for LZ77 distances. Using these two tables, the decoder performs Huffman and LZ77 decoding. So what is the Code Huffman table? The Literal/Length and Distance tables are stored compressed in the stream—again via Huffman coding. The Code Huffman table is the dynamic Huffman table used to decode the Huffman tables (lengths) themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        case LENLENS:

We loop &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;ncode&lt;/code&gt; times and read 3 bits each time into &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;lens&lt;/code&gt;. These 3-bit values are code lengths—the Huffman table is represented by lengths, not the full bit patterns, as discussed earlier. Thus, &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;lens&lt;/code&gt; records the Code Huffman table’s code lengths in the &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt; permutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;static const unsigned short order[19] = /* permutation of code lengths */

The Code table decodes original values 0–18. Storing lengths for all 19 values would be inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, codes are used more frequently in the same order as &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt;. If we stored lengths in plain 0–18 order, we’d need to write zeros for many unused values (e.g., 0–15) before the frequently used 16, 17, 18. By ordering them as above, we can store just the lengths for the frequently used codes and leave the rest implicit. The code reflects this: it reads &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;ncode&lt;/code&gt; lengths, and sets the remaining entries to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then set &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;next&lt;/code&gt; to point into &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;codes&lt;/code&gt;, and call &lt;code&gt;inflate_table&lt;/code&gt; to build the Huffman table. The resulting table is written at &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;next&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;lencode&lt;/code&gt;). We’ll cover &lt;code&gt;inflate_table&lt;/code&gt; shortly.

Also, &lt;code&gt;here.bits&lt;/code&gt; is the number of bits consumed to decode that symbol; i.e., it’s the code length, and the decoder uses &lt;code&gt;DROPBITS(here.bits)&lt;/code&gt; to consume bits. This is standard Huffman decoding. But there are other decoding forms depending on &lt;code&gt;here.op&lt;/code&gt;—we’ll explain this in the table construction section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        case LEN:

The in-function Huffman decoding is slower because it transitions through VM-like states; &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; operates with full buffers and fewer checks. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; requires sufficiently large input/output buffers to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;int ZLIB_INTERNAL inflate_table(codetype type, unsigned short FAR *lens,

As the comment indicates, these fields can play different roles depending on &lt;code&gt;op&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;

        if (lens[sym] != 0) work[offs[lens[sym]]++] = (unsigned short)sym;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s step through table construction. First we count, for each code length, how many symbols use that length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then determine the minimum and maximum code lengths from &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; and set &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, the table’s index bit width. &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; initially comes from the &lt;code&gt;bits&lt;/code&gt; argument but may be adjusted based on min/max. That’s why &lt;code&gt;bits&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer: any adjustments made in &lt;code&gt;inflate_table&lt;/code&gt; must also be visible to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Huffman table is a simple 1D array, indexed by bits: &lt;code&gt;table[huffman_code] = decoded_value (actually a code struct to decode it)&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; is really the number of index bits—i.e., the size of the primary table. If &lt;code&gt;root=7&lt;/code&gt;, the table has entries up to &lt;code&gt;table[127(0b1111111)]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;root &amp;gt; max&lt;/code&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;root = max&lt;/code&gt; to avoid wasting space. If &lt;code&gt;root &amp;lt; min&lt;/code&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;root = min&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise you couldn’t store any codes at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if &lt;code&gt;root = min&lt;/code&gt;, how do we store codes longer than &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;? Using multi-level tables. As we’ve seen, the &lt;code&gt;op&lt;/code&gt; field can indicate a second-level lookup. For example, suppose there are ten 8‑bit codes and one 9‑bit code. You don’t want to double the table size (from 256 to 512 entries) just for one symbol. So the primary table has 256 entries; all 8‑bit codes and the prefixes of any longer codes are stored there. For longer codes, entries in the primary table point to sub-tables that hold the remaining bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll see the exact mechanics below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; is decided, we build the &lt;code&gt;offs&lt;/code&gt; array to sort symbols by code length and symbol order into &lt;code&gt;work&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;work&lt;/code&gt; array is needed to reconstruct the full Huffman codes from the lengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A -&amp;gt; 2 (00)
B -&amp;gt; 3 (110)
C -&amp;gt; 2 (01)
D -&amp;gt; 2 (10)
E -&amp;gt; 3 (111)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reconstruct codes from lengths, group symbols with the same length and assign codes in order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A -&amp;gt; 2 (00)
C -&amp;gt; 2 (01)
D -&amp;gt; 2 (10)
B -&amp;gt; 3 (110)
E -&amp;gt; 3 (111)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;work&lt;/code&gt; is the array that encodes this ordering; the build loop will walk &lt;code&gt;work&lt;/code&gt; to assign codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    /* set up for code type */
    switch (type) {
    case CODES:
        base = extra = work;    /* dummy value--not used */
        match = 20;
        break;
    case LENS:
        base = lbase;
        extra = lext;
        match = 257;

        base = dbase;
        extra = dext;
        match = 0;
    }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, we set &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;extra&lt;/code&gt;. These support the Base/Extra decoding mode described below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Huffman table lengths in the stream are usually stored by position (index), since that index is the original value—e.g., index 65 corresponds to ‘A’. This is efficient for literals (0–255). But what about LZ77 length/distance values? Deflate specifies length range 3–258 and distance range 1–32,768, making a direct per‑value table impractical. So lengths and distances use Base/Extra coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; indicates where Base/Extra decoding begins. For Literal/Length, 0–255 are literals and 256 is End of Block; from 257 upward (LZ77 lengths), Base/Extra applies—so &lt;code&gt;match=257&lt;/code&gt;. The Code table doesn’t use Base/Extra at all, so &lt;code&gt;match=20&lt;/code&gt; (greater than the largest code index). Distance uses Base/Extra for all symbols, so &lt;code&gt;match=0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;extra&lt;/code&gt; select the arrays used for Base/Extra depending on whether we’re building the length or distance table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    /* initialize state for loop */

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the main construction loop. We iterate through &lt;code&gt;work&lt;/code&gt;, creating a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; entry for each symbol. If &lt;code&gt;symbol+1 &amp;lt; match&lt;/code&gt;, it’s a normal entry: &lt;code&gt;op=0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;val=symbol&lt;/code&gt;.

In the simple case above, it’s the final literal; with Base/Extra, it’s a special symbol that needs further interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;symbol &amp;gt;= match&lt;/code&gt;, we create an entry using the Base/Extra scheme: &lt;code&gt;op&lt;/code&gt; holds the number of extra bits, &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; holds the base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;            state-&amp;gt;length = (unsigned)here.val;

Before explaining why, let’s note something important:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A -&amp;gt; 00
B -&amp;gt; 01
C -&amp;gt; 10
D -&amp;gt; 110
E -&amp;gt; 111&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we naively stored:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;next[0(0b00)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='A')
next[1(0b01)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='B')
next[2(0b10)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='C')
next[6(0b110)] = here(op=0, bits=3, val='D')
next[7(0b111)] = here(op=0, bits=3, val='E')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;that looks reasonable—but it’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider compressing “CB”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0b10(C) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0 + 0b01(B) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2 = 0b0110&lt;/code&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bits are packed least significant bit first; simply concatenating as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0b1001&lt;/code&gt;would make bitwise decoding impossible.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compressed bits for &lt;code&gt;CB&lt;/code&gt; (0b0110) match those for &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; (0b110). Even though the code set is prefix-free when read left-to-right, Deflate uses a bitstream where the trailing bits act as prefixes due to LSB-first packing. To handle this, we reverse the bit order when building indices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;next[0(0b00)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='A')
next[2(0b10)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='B')
next[1(0b01)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='C')
next[3(0b011)] = here(op=0, bits=3, val='D')
next[7(0b111)] = here(op=0, bits=3, val='E')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the correct index order is 0,2,1,3,7 rather than 0,1,2,6,7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        /* replicate for those indices with low len bits equal to huff */
        incr = 1U &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (len - drop);
        fill = 1U &amp;lt;&amp;lt; curr;
        min = fill;                 /* save offset to next table */
        do {
            fill -= incr;
            next[(huff &amp;gt;&amp;gt; drop) + fill] = here;
        } while (fill != 0);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the loop. &lt;code&gt;huff&lt;/code&gt; holds the (bit-reversed) Huffman code in progress. We don’t just store at &lt;code&gt;next[huff]&lt;/code&gt;; we fill out all positions differing only in the unused high bits of the primary table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; curr&lt;/code&gt; (table size), and &lt;code&gt;incr&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; len&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (len - drop)&lt;/code&gt; for sub-tables). So the effect is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the primary table has&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curr=root&lt;/code&gt;bits, and&lt;code&gt;huff=0b111&lt;/code&gt;with code length 3, then fill covers:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re enumerating the higher bits that are irrelevant to this code length. This allows constant-time decoding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;next[0(0b00), 4(0b100)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='A')
next[2(0b10), 6(0b110)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='B')
next[1(0b01), 6(0b101)] = here(op=0, bits=2, val='C')
next[3(0b011)] = here(op=0, bits=3, val='D')
next[7(0b111)] = here(op=0, bits=3, val='E')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;When decoding &lt;code&gt;AC&lt;/code&gt; (0b0100), we can immediately index &lt;code&gt;next[0b100]&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;BITS(root)&lt;/code&gt; and decode ‘A’ without checking code lengths; then drop 2 bits and continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the actual decoding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;here = state-&amp;gt;lencode[BITS(state-&amp;gt;lenbits)];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implements the same idea: index with fixed &lt;code&gt;lenbits&lt;/code&gt; and decode immediately. The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop plus &lt;code&gt;fill/incr&lt;/code&gt; achieve this optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        /* backwards increment the len-bit code huff */

Then we use the next bit (1) to index the sub-table, yielding &lt;code&gt;here(op=0, bits=1, val='E')&lt;/code&gt;; we consume 1 bit and emit ‘E’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    /* fill in remaining table entry if code is incomplete (guaranteed to have

Do you see the bug? Everything looks well designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a subtle issue in the Huffman table construction. A Huffman table can be incomplete. For example, if &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; is 8 and the maximum code length is 10, there will be no entries for length‑9 codes; i.e., some table entries remain unset. Are such NULL entries handled correctly during decoding?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// inflate.c

Or, they may retain stale values from a previous block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve high speed, &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; omits many checks; it can therefore cause memory corruption when encountering incomplete Huffman tables. Let’s explore how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first memory bug identified was an integer overflow, but it wasn’t exploitable. The second was a stream overflow, which we ultimately exploited. We’ll describe both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what happens when a zero‑initialized table entry (&lt;code&gt;op=0, bits=0, val=0&lt;/code&gt;) is used in decoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      dolen:

Since no bits are consumed, &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; would loop forever decoding that same entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    } while (in &amp;lt; last &amp;amp;&amp;amp; out &amp;lt; end);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the loop is bounded by &lt;code&gt;out &amp;lt; end&lt;/code&gt;, so no overflow occurs here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      dolen:

            }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance decoding behaves similarly, but worse: the second-level lookup jumps back into the distance decode path. The “0th table entry” behavior is dangerous, because the second-level lookup is designed to read a sub-table (with smaller &lt;code&gt;bits&lt;/code&gt;), but instead it’s indexing the primary table. &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; keeps at least 16 bits in &lt;code&gt;hold&lt;/code&gt; and assumes no codes exceed 15 bits, so it omits checks. The erroneous “0th entry” lookup breaks this assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are Huffman codes guaranteed ≤15 bits? Because the Code Huffman table itself can only encode lengths up to 15; longer lengths cannot be represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Bit buffer size: 16 (minimum present)
Primary table root: 10
Maximum Huffman code length: 12

1. Normal second-level distance lookup -&amp;gt; uninitialized entry `op=0, bits=0, val=0` (bits: 16 - 10 = 6)
2. Abnormal second-level lookup -&amp;gt; 0th primary-table entry (bits: 6 - 0 = 6)
3. Decoding the 0th primary-table entry (bits: 6 - 10 = -2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted, the distance path jumps back into distance decoding after the second-level lookup, so the primary table (not sub-table) is indexed next, consuming too many bits. Ultimately, the &lt;code&gt;bits&lt;/code&gt; counter underflows—an integer overflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    /* return unused bytes (on entry, bits &amp;lt; 8, so in won't go too far back) */

p.interactive()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reproduce the case described above. The Distance table has &lt;code&gt;root=10&lt;/code&gt; with a maximum code length of 12, so there are unfilled entries with &lt;code&gt;op=0, bits=0, val=0&lt;/code&gt;. By crafting the stream to force a multilevel lookup, we can trigger the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    symbol_stream.append(("INVALID", (int('000000000000110'[::-1],2),15)))
    symbol_stream.append(("INVALID", (int('000000001001'[::-1],2),12)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are key. The first is a valid 15‑bit length code. The second is an invalid 12‑bit distance code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dist_lengths[4] = 12 # Distance 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The valid distance‑5 code is &lt;code&gt;000000001000&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, &lt;code&gt;000000001001&lt;/code&gt; forces a second‑level lookup that reads an uninitialized &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, &lt;code&gt;next_in&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;avail_in&lt;/code&gt; are corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this particular memory corruption was not exploitable. If we first decompress dummy data in block one, and then in a second block trigger the bug with a Literal/Length table that only contains EOB, we can corrupt &lt;code&gt;next_in&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;avail_in&lt;/code&gt; without crashing. But since these are input stream variables (not output buffer variables), we couldn’t achieve an overflow or OOB write on the decompressed output buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what should we target to exploit uninitialized table entries? The most promising avenue in zlib is to abuse the copy routines. The stored-block copy and the LZ77 copy are powerful overwrite primitives—if we can disable the checks that constrain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, we need to corrupt &lt;code&gt;avail_out&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;avail_in&lt;/code&gt;.

Earlier we noted that &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; is entered only when &lt;code&gt;strm-&amp;gt;avail_out &amp;gt;= 258&lt;/code&gt;, and the loop exits as soon as that’s no longer true. Thus, &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; can safely omit length checks because it guarantees there are at least 258 bytes of space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;            state-&amp;gt;next = state-&amp;gt;codes;
            state-&amp;gt;lencode = state-&amp;gt;distcode = (const code FAR *)(state-&amp;gt;next);

The tables’ boundaries aren’t fixed either; &lt;code&gt;state-&amp;gt;next&lt;/code&gt; advances dynamically, so different blocks can lay out different tables at different offsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, stale entries from a previous block can persist in uninitialized slots of later tables—even of different types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a Distance-table entry from a previous block remains in an uninitialized slot of the subsequent Literal/Length table, we’re in trouble. Deflate limits lengths to 258, but distances can be much larger. If a stale Distance entry is misinterpreted as a Length entry in &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt;, its length can exceed 258, breaking the invariant that made &lt;code&gt;inflate_fast&lt;/code&gt; safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;    strm-&amp;gt;avail_out = (unsigned)(out &amp;lt; end ?
                                 257 + (end - out) : 257 - (out - end));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, when the LZ77 decode interprets a stale Distance entry as a Length, &lt;code&gt;strm-&amp;gt;avail_out&lt;/code&gt; suffers an integer overflow. Unlike &lt;code&gt;avail_in&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;avail_out&lt;/code&gt; reflects the remaining size of the output buffer, so this immediately leads to a buffer overflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define MAX_INPUT_SIZE 4096

    &lt;p&gt; Posted Sep 30, 2025 10:30 UTC (Tue) by patrakov (subscriber, #97174) [Link] Here I see the risk of the mainline kernel reverting the changes in other subsystems, because they might no longer have an in-tree user. Am I paranoid? What's the Bcachefs project's position on this risk if it is material - are they going to adapt, or go back to telling the user to compile their tree, as opposed to compiling just their module against an existing kernel?

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will be a short and sweet post. As I’m not big on goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disqus started showing ads for their “free” tier comments system a few years back. At the time, the communication they sent out via email, seemed quite laid-back and had the tone of “don’t worry about it, it’s not a big thing”. Which in part lead me to almost forget it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, the disqus comments system looked quite smart and sleek. I remember thinking that the ads system will possibly look smart and sleek too. Which alleviated any worries I had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WELL&amp;amp;mldr;&amp;amp;mldr;.I’ve just seen the ads, and they look horrific!!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Apologies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a Pihole set up, so ads are blocked on my home network. When I’m out of the house, my phone is connected to a Wireguard VPN which routes my data through my home internet, therefore - getting all the ad-blocking, Pihole goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years with Pi-hole, which now blocks over a million domains, I’ve become incredibly accustomed to a mostly ad-free web. Without realizing it, Iâd forgotten what the typical internet experience feels like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to get a couple of emails from Disqus, letting me know that there’s a new comment on this blog. I haven’t had many of these emails recently, so I decided to disable my adblocker for a few minutes and check out the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were none, instead I was greeted by some horribly formatted and obviously scammy ads:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the people who read this blog, I’m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I became “blind” to what the web is really like for most users. Iâve tried to keep this blog minimalist - a clean place to find answers. Those ads not only ruin that experience; they trample privacy too:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this post, Iâve removed Disqus. It was making my blog worse, and frankly, they were profiting off my work and my visitor’s data. I want this blog to be a resource for devs and technologists, free not just in money, but in freedom from unwanted tracking and invasive ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Any Alternatives?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm not entirely sure comments are needed here. There are other ways to reach me, for example; GitHub or Twitter/X. But having a place for discussion under each post can be valuable. If you have any recommendations for alternative commenting systems (especially those that respect privacy or are self-hosted), Iâd love to hear them! Please reach out if youâve found something that works well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks as always for reading - your trust matters to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry again for the mess!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An effect that’s being more and more widely reported is the increase in time it’s taking developers to modify or fix code that was generated by Large Language Models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked on legacy systems that were written by other people, perhaps decades ago, you’ll recognise this phenomenon. Before we can safely change code, we first need to understand it – understand what it does, and also oftentimes why it does it the way it does. In that sense, this is nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is new is the scale of the problem being created as lightning-speed code generators spew reams of unread code into millions of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teams that care about quality will take the time to review and understand (and more often than not, rework) LLM-generated code before it makes it into the repo. This slows things down, to the extent that any time saved using the LLM coding assistant is often canceled out by the downstream effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But some teams have opted for a different approach. They’re the ones checking in code nobody’s read, and that’s only been cursorily tested – if it’s been tested at all. And, evidently, there’s a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When teams produce code faster than they can understand it, it creates what I’ve been calling “comprehension debt”. If the software gets used, then the odds are high that at some point that generated code will need to change. The “A.I.” boosters will say “We can just get the tool to do that”. And that might work maybe 70% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But those of us who’ve experimented a lot with using LLMs for code generation and modification know that there will be times when the tool just won’t be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Doom loops”, when we go round and round in circles trying to get an LLM, or a bunch of different LLMs, to fix a problem that it just doesn’t seem to be able to, are an everyday experience using this technology. Anyone claiming it doesn’t happen to them has either been extremely lucky, or is fibbing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty much guaranteed that there will be many times when we have to edit the code ourselves. The “comprehension debt” is the extra time it’s going to take us to understand it first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we’re sitting on a rapidly growing mountain of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Using the TPDE Codegen Backend in LLVM ORC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TPDE is a single-pass compiler backend for LLVM that was open-sourced earlier this year by researchers at TUM. The comprehensive documentation walks you through integrating TPDE into custom builds of Clang and Flang. Currently, it supports LLVM 19 and LLVM 20 release versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Integration in LLVM ORC JIT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TPDE’s primary strength lies in delivering low-latency code generation while maintaining reasonable &lt;code&gt;-O0&lt;/code&gt; code quality — making it an ideal choice for a baseline JIT compiler. LLVM’s On-Request Compilation (ORC) framework provides a set of libraries for building JIT compilers for LLVM IR. While ORC uses LLVM’s built-in backends by default, its flexible architecture makes it straightforward to swap in TPDE instead!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say we use the &lt;code&gt;LLJITBuilder&lt;/code&gt; interface to instantiate an off-the-shelf JIT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ExitOnError ExitOnErr;
auto Builder = LLJITBuilder();
std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;LLJIT&amp;gt; JIT = ExitOnErr(Builder.create());
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The builder offers several extension points to customize the JIT instance it creates. To integrate TPDE, we’ll override the &lt;code&gt;CreateCompileFunction&lt;/code&gt; member, which defines how LLVM IR gets compiled into machine code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Builder.CreateCompileFunction = [](JITTargetMachineBuilder JTMB)
    -&amp;gt; Expected&amp;lt;std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;IRCompileLayer::IRCompiler&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {
  return std::make_unique&amp;lt;TPDECompiler&amp;gt;(JTMB);
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use TPDE in this context, we need to wrap it in a class that’s compatible with ORC’s interface:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;class TPDECompiler : public IRCompileLayer::IRCompiler {
public:
  TPDECompiler(JITTargetMachineBuilder JTMB)
      : IRCompiler(irManglingOptionsFromTargetOptions(JTMB.getOptions())) {
    Compiler = tpde_llvm::LLVMCompiler::create(JTMB.getTargetTriple());
    assert(Compiler != nullptr &amp;amp;&amp;amp; "Unknown architecture");
  }

  Expected&amp;lt;std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;MemoryBuffer&amp;gt;&amp;gt; operator()(Module &amp;amp;M) override;

private:
  std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;tpde_llvm::LLVMCompiler&amp;gt; Compiler;
  std::vector&amp;lt;std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;std::vector&amp;lt;uint8_t&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Buffers;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the constructor, we initialize TPDE with a target triple (like &lt;code&gt;x86_64-pc-linux-gnu&lt;/code&gt;). TPDE currently works on ELF-based systems and supports both 64-bit Intel and ARM architectures (&lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;aarch64&lt;/code&gt;). For now let’s assume that’s all we need. Now let’s implement the actual wrapper code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Expected&amp;lt;std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;MemoryBuffer&amp;gt;&amp;gt; TPDECompiler::operator()(Module &amp;amp;M) {
  Buffers.push_back(std::make_unique&amp;lt;std::vector&amp;lt;uint8_t&amp;gt;&amp;gt;());
  std::vector&amp;lt;uint8_t&amp;gt; &amp;amp;B = *Buffers.back();

  if (!Compiler-&amp;gt;compile_to_elf(M, B)) {
    std::string Msg;
    raw_string_ostream(Msg) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "TPDE failed to compile: " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; M.getName();
    return createStringError(std::move(Msg), inconvertibleErrorCode());
  }

  StringRef BufferRef{reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;char *&amp;gt;(B.data()), B.size()};
  return MemoryBuffer::getMemBuffer(BufferRef, "", false);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s happening: we create a new buffer &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; to store the compiled binary code, then pass both the buffer and the module &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; to TPDE for compilation. If TPDE fails, we bail out with an error. On success, we wrap the result in a &lt;code&gt;MemoryBuffer&lt;/code&gt; and return it. (Note: LLVM still uses &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; pointers for binary buffers and the three-way definition of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; in the C Standard falls on our feet sometimes, but it’s difficult to change in a mature codebase like LLVM.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the basic integration this is it! No need to patch LLVM — this works with official release versions. We can compile simple LLVM IR code already:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; cat 01-basic.ll 
; ModuleID = 'test.ll'
source_filename = "test.ll"

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  %1 = call i32 @custom_entry()
  %2 = sub i32 %1, 123
  ret i32 %2
}

define i32 @custom_entry() {
entry:
  ret i32 123
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve created a complete working demo on GitHub that you can try out. The code in the repo handles a few more details that we’ll explore shortly. Here’s what the output looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ./tpde-orc 01-basic.ll 
Loaded module: 01-basic.ll
Executing main()
Program returned: 0

&amp;gt; ./tpde-orc 01-basic.ll --entrypoint custom_entry
Loaded module: 01-basic.ll
Executing custom_entry()
Program returned: 123
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can already see a 4x speedup with TPDE compared to built-in LLVM codegen for 100 repetitions with a large self-contained module that was generated with csmith:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ./build/tpde-orc --par 1 tpde-orc/03-csmith-tpde.ll
...
Compile-time was: 2200 ms

&amp;gt; ./build/tpde-orc --par 1 tpde-orc/03-csmith-tpde.ll --llvm
...
Compile-time was: 8820 ms
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LLJITBuilder has a Catch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;LLJITBuilder&lt;/code&gt; is convenient, it comes with a minor trade-off. The interface incorporates standard LLVM components including &lt;code&gt;TargetRegistry&lt;/code&gt;, which is perfectly reasonable for most use cases. However, this creates a dependency we might not want: the built-in LLVM target backend must be initialized first via &lt;code&gt;InitializeNativeTarget()&lt;/code&gt;. This means we still need to ship the LLVM backend, even though TPDE could theoretically replace it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to avoid this dependency, you’ll need to set up your ORC JIT manually. For inspiration on this approach, check out how the &lt;code&gt;tpde-lli&lt;/code&gt; tool implements it. Before diving into that rabbit hole though, let’s explore another important aspect!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementing a LLVM Fallback&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason why TPDE is so fast and compact is that it focusses on the most common use cases rather than covering every edge case in the LLVM instruction set. The documentation provides this guideline:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Code generated by Clang (-O0/-O1) will typically compile; -O2 and higher will typically fail due to unsupported vector operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When your code includes advanced features like vector operations or non-trivial floating-point types, TPDE won’t be able to handle it. In these cases, we need a fallback to LLVM. Since this scenario is quite common in real-world applications, most tools will include both backends (and we can keep using &lt;code&gt;LLJITBuilder&lt;/code&gt;). Implementing the fallback is straightforward using ORC’s CompileUtils:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Let’s test our fallback mechanism with the following IR file that uses an unsupported type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@const_val = global bfloat 0xR4248

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  %c = load bfloat, ptr @const_val

  ret i32 %i
}
&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ./tpde-orc 02-bfloat.ll
Loaded module: 02-bfloat.ll
[2025-09-25 12:54:03.076] [error] unsupported type: bfloat

Falling back to LLVM for module: 02-bfloat.ll
Executing main()
Program returned: 50
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this implementation, we create a new &lt;code&gt;SimpleCompiler&lt;/code&gt; instance for each fallback case. While this adds some overhead, it’s acceptable since we’re already on the slow path. The key assumption is that most code in your workload will successfully compile with TPDE — if that’s not the case, then TPDE might not be the right choice in the first place. Interestingly, this approach has a valuable side-effect that becomes important in the next section: it’s inherently thread-safe!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Adding Concurrent Compilation Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ORC JIT has built-in support for concurrent compilation. This is neat, but it requires attention when customizing the JIT. Our current setup uses a single &lt;code&gt;TPDECompiler&lt;/code&gt; instance, but TPDE’s &lt;code&gt;compile_to_elf()&lt;/code&gt; method isn’t thread-safe. Enabling concurrent compilation would cause multiple threads to call this method simultaneously, leading to failures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can we solve this? One option would be creating a new &lt;code&gt;tpde_llvm::LLVMCompiler&lt;/code&gt; instance for each compilation job, but that adds an overhead of &lt;code&gt;O(#jobs)&lt;/code&gt; — not ideal for our fast path. Essentially, we want to avoid calling into &lt;code&gt;compile_to_elf()&lt;/code&gt; while there is another call in-flight on the same thread. We can achieve this easily by making the &lt;code&gt;TPDECompiler&lt;/code&gt; instance thread-local, reducing the overhead to just &lt;code&gt;O(#threads)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Exercising Concurrent Lookup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It needs a lot more support code to actually exercise concurrent compilation and do basic performance measurments. The complete sample project on GitHub has one possible implementation: after loading the input module, it creates 100 duplicates of it with different entry-point names and issues a single JIT lookup for all the entry-points at once. Here’s a simplified version of how this works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SymbolMap SymMap;
SymbolLookupSet EntryPoints = addDuplicates(JIT, Mod);

outs() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Compiling " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EntryPoints.size() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; " modules on " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Threads
        &amp;lt;&amp;lt; " threads in parallel\n";

using namespace std::chrono;
auto ES = JIT-&amp;gt;getExecutionSession();
auto SO = makeJITDylibSearchOrder({JIT-&amp;gt;getMainJITDylib()});
auto Start = steady_clock::now();
{
  // Lookup all entry-points at once to execise concurrent compilation
  SymMap = ExitOnErr(ES.lookup(SO, EntryPoints));
}
auto End = steady_clock::now();
auto Elapsed = duration_cast&amp;lt;milliseconds&amp;gt;(End - Start);

outs() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Compile-time was: " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Elapsed.count() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; " ms\n";
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compile-times for our csmith example drop from ~2200ms to just ~740ms when utilizing 8 threads in parallel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ./tpde-orc --par 8 tpde-orc/03-csmith-tpde.ll
Load module: tpde-orc/03-csmith-tpde.ll
Compiling 100 modules on 8 threads in parallel
...
Compile-time was: 737 ms
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Et voilà!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s wrap it up and appreciate the remarkable complexity that LLVM effortlessly handles in our little example. We parse a well-defined, human-readable representation of Turing-complete programs generated from various general-purpose languages like C++, Fortran, Rust, Swift, Julia, and Zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM’s composable JIT engine seamlessly manages these parsed modules, automatically resolving symbols and dependencies. It compiles machine code in the native object format on-demand for multiple platforms and CPU architectures, while giving us complete control over the optimization pipeline, code generator (like our TPDE integration) and many more components. The engine then links everything into an executable form — all in-memory and without external tools or platform-specific dynamic library tricks! It’s really impressive that we can simply enable compilation on N threads in parallel and have it “just work” :-)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directed graph shell, dgsh (pronounced /dÃ¦É¡Ê/ — dagsh), provides an expressive way to construct sophisticated and efficient big data set and stream processing pipelines using existing Unix tools as well as custom-built components. It is a Unix-style shell (based on bash) allowing the specification of pipelines with non-linear non-uniform operations. These form a directed acyclic process graph, which is typically executed by multiple processor cores, thus increasing the operation's processing throughput.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a feeling on how dgsh works in practice, skip right down to the examples section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a more formal introduction to dgsh or to cite it in your work, see:&lt;lb/&gt; Diomidis Spinellis and Marios Fragkoulis. Extending Unix Pipelines to DAGs. IEEE Transactions on Computers, 2017. doi: 10.1109/TC.2017.2695447 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dgsh provides two new ways for expressing inter-process communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;comm&lt;/code&gt; command supplied with dgsh
expects two input channels and produces on its output three
output channels: the lines appearing only in first (sorted) channel,
the lines appearing only in the second channel,
and the lines appearing in both.
Connecting the output of the &lt;code&gt;comm&lt;/code&gt; command to the
&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; command supplied with dgsh
will make the three outputs appear in sequence,
while connecting it to the
&lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt; command supplied with dgsh
will make the output appear in its customary format.
&lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wc -c&lt;/code&gt;
receives two inputs and produces two outputs:
the MD5 hash of its input and the input's size.
Data to multipipe blocks are typically provided with a
dgsh-aware version of &lt;code&gt;tee&lt;/code&gt; and collected by
dgsh-aware versions of programs such as
&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;dgsh-writeval&lt;/code&gt;, and
a reader program, &lt;code&gt;dgsh-readval&lt;/code&gt;.
The behavior of a stored value's IO can be modified by adding flags to
&lt;code&gt;dgsh-writeval&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dgsh-readval&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;A dgsh script follows the syntax of a bash(1) shell script with the addition of multipipe blocks. A multipipe block contains one or more dgsh simple commands, other multipipe blocks, or pipelines of the previous two types of commands. The commands in a multipipe block are executed asynchronously (in parallel, in the background). Data may be redirected or piped into and out of a multipipe block. With multipipe blocks dgsh scripts form directed acyclic process graphs. It follows from the above description that multipipe blocks can be recursively composed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a simple example consider running the following command directly within dgsh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;{{ echo hello &amp;amp; echo world &amp;amp; }} | paste&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; or by invoking &lt;code&gt;dgsh&lt;/code&gt; with the command as an argument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;dgsh -c '{{ echo hello &amp;amp; echo world &amp;amp; }} | paste'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The command will run paste with input from the two echo processes to output &lt;code&gt;hello world&lt;/code&gt;.
This is equivalent to running the following bash command,
but with the flow of data appearing in the natural left-to-right order.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;paste &amp;lt;(echo hello) &amp;lt;(echo world)&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the following larger example, which compares the performance of different compression utilities, the script's standard input is distributed to three compression utilities (xz, bzip2, and gzip), to assess their performance, and also to file and wc to report the input data's type and size. The printf commands label the data of each processing type. All eight commands pass their output to the &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; command, which gathers their outputs
in order.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;tee | {{ printf 'File type:\t' file - printf 'Original size:\t' wc -c printf 'xz:\t\t' xz -c | wc -c printf 'bzip2:\t\t' bzip2 -c | wc -c printf 'gzip:\t\t' gzip -c | wc -c }} | cat&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Formally, dgsh extends the syntax of the (modified) Unix Bourne-shell when &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; provided with the &lt;code&gt;--dgsh&lt;/code&gt; argument
as follows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;dgsh_block&amp;gt; ::= '{{' &amp;lt;dgsh_list&amp;gt; '}}' &amp;lt;dgsh_list&amp;gt; ::= &amp;lt;dgsh_list_item&amp;gt; '&amp;amp;' &amp;lt;dgsh_list_item&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dgsh_list&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dgsh_list_item&amp;gt; ::= &amp;lt;simple_command&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dgsh_block&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dgsh_list_item&amp;gt; '|' &amp;lt;dgsh_list_item&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of Unix tools have been adapted to support multiple inputs and outputs to match their natural capabilities. This echoes a similar adaptation that was performed in the early 1970s when Unix and the shell got pipes and the pipeline syntax. Many programs that worked with files were adjusted to work as filters. The number of input and output channels of dgsh-compatible commands are as follows, based on the supplied command-line arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Tool&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Inputs&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Outputs&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Notes&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;cat (dgsh-tee)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—M&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;No options are supported&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;cmp&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;comm&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Output streams in order: lines only in first file, lines only in second one, and lines in both files&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;cut&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;With &lt;code&gt;--multistream&lt;/code&gt; output each range into a different stream&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;diff&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Typically two inputs. Compare an arbitrary number of input streams with the &lt;code&gt;--from-file&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--to-file&lt;/code&gt; options&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;diff3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—3&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;grep&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—4&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Available output streams (via arguments): matching files, non-matching files, matching lines, and non-matching lines&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;join&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—2&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;paste&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Paste N input streams&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;perm&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Rearrange the order of N input streams&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;sort&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; option, merge sort N input streams&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;tee (dgsh-tee)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—M&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Only the &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; option is supported&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;dgsh-readval&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Read a value from a socket&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="4"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;dgsh-wrap&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—N&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0—1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Wrap non-dgsh commands and negotiate on their behalf&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;dgsh-writeval&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Write a value to a socket&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, POSIX user commands that receive no input or only generate no output, when executed in a dgsh context are wrapped to specify the corresponding input or output capability. For example, an &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; command in a multipipe block
will appear to receive no input, but will provide one output stream.
By default &lt;code&gt;dgsh&lt;/code&gt; automatically wraps all other
commands as filters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, note that any dgsh script will accept and generate the number of inputs and outputs associated with the commands or multipipe blocks at its two endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dgsh suite has been tested under Debian and Ubuntu Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. A Cygwin port is underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An installation of GraphViz will allow you to visualize the dgsh graphs that you specify in your programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compile and run dgsh you will need to have the following commands installed on your system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;make automake gcc libtool pkg-config texinfo help2man autopoint bison check gperf git xz-utils gettextTo test dgsh you will need to have the following commands installed in your system:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;wbritish wamerican libfftw3-dev csh curl bzip2&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go through the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;git clone --recursive https://github.com/dspinellis/dgsh.git&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;make config&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;make&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;sudo make install&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; By default, the program and its documentation are installed under &lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt;.
You can modify this by setting the &lt;code&gt;PREFIX&lt;/code&gt; variable
in the `config` step, for example:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;make PREFIX=$HOME config make make install&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issue the following command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;make test&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compile and run dgsh you will need to have the following packages installed in your system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;devel/automake devel/bison devel/check devel/git devel/gmake devel/gperf misc/help2man print/texinfo shells/bashTo test dgsh you will need to have the following ports installed on your system:&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;archivers/bzip2 ftp/curl&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go through the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;git clone --recursive https://github.com/dspinellis/dgsh.git&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;gmake config&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;gmake&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;sudo gmake install&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; By default, the program and its documentation are installed under &lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt;.

The commands are listed in the order of usefulness in everyday scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Report file type, length, and compression performance for data received from the standard input. The data never touches the disk. Demonstrates the use of an output multipipe to source many commands from one followed by an input multipipe to sink to one command the output of many and the use of dgsh-tee that is used both to propagate the same input to many commands and collect output from many commands orderly in a way that is transparent to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;#!/usr/bin/env dgsh tee | {{ printf 'File type:\t' file - printf 'Original size:\t' wc -c printf 'xz:\t\t' xz -c | wc -c printf 'bzip2:\t\t' bzip2 -c | wc -c printf 'gzip:\t\t' gzip -c | wc -c }} | cat&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Process the Git history, and list the authors and days of the week ordered by the number of their commits.

    &lt;p&gt;Languages designed to represent all types of graph data structures, such as Graphviz's DOT Language and Mermaid JS's flowchart syntax, don't take advantage of the properties specific to DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DAGs act like rivers. Water doesn't flow upstream (tides and floods being exceptions). Sections of a river at the same elevation can't be the inputs or outputs of each other, like the nodes C, D, and E in the image below. Their input is B. C outputs to F, while D and E output to G.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DEML's goal is to use this ordering as part of the file syntax to make it easier for humans to parse. In DEML we represent an elevation marker with &lt;code&gt;----&lt;/code&gt; on a new line. The order of elevation clusters is significant, but the order of nodes between two &lt;code&gt;----&lt;/code&gt; elevation markers is not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;UpRiver &amp;gt; A

A &amp;gt; B

----
C
D
E
----
F &amp;lt; C
G &amp;lt; D | E &amp;gt; DownRiver
----
DownRiver &amp;lt; F&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nodes are defined by the first word on a line. The defined node can point to its outputs with &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and to its inputs with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;. Inputs and outputs are separated by &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dagrs is a library for running multiple tasks with dependencies defined in a DAG. In DEML, shell commands can be assigned to a node with &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;. DEML files can be run via dag-rs with the comand &lt;code&gt;deml run -i &amp;lt;filepath&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compare the difference in readability, here is the Dagrs YAML example in both YAML and DEML&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dagrs:
  a:
    name: "Task 1"
    after: [ b, c ]
    cmd: echo a
  b:
    name: "Task 2"
    after: [ c, f, g ]
    cmd: echo b
  c:
    name: "Task 3"
    after: [ e, g ]
    cmd: echo c
  d:
    name: "Task 4"
    after: [ c, e ]
    cmd: echo d
  e:
    name: "Task 5"
    after: [ h ]
    cmd: echo e
  f:
    name: "Task 6"
    after: [ g ]
    cmd: python3 ./tests/config/test.py
  g:
    name: "Task 7"
    after: [ h ]
    cmd: node ./tests/config/test.js
  h:
    name: "Task 8"
    cmd: echo h&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;H &amp;gt; E | G = echo h
----
G = node ./tests/config/test.js
E = echo e
----
F &amp;lt; G = python3 ./tests/config/test.py
C &amp;lt; E | G = echo c
----
B &amp;lt; C | F | G = echo b
D &amp;lt; C | E = echo d
----
A &amp;lt; B | C = echo a&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To convert DEML files to Mermaid Diagram files (.mmd) use the command &lt;code&gt;deml mermaid -i &amp;lt;inputfile&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;outputfile&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The mermaid file can be used to generate an image at mermaid.live&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Put my idea for an elevation based DAG representation into the wild&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run DAGs with dag-rs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Convert DEML files to Mermaid Diagram files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syntax highlighting tree-sitter-deml&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add a syntax to label edges&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thinking about how it's annoying in languages like C when function declaration order matters. Then I wondered if there could be a case when it would be a nice feature for declaration order to matter and I thought of DAGs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts, maker of video games like “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” and “The Sims,” is being acquired for $52.5 billion in what could become the largest-ever buyout funded by private-equity firms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund PIF, and Affinity Partners will pay EA’s stockholders $210 per share. Affinity Partners is run by President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PIF, which was already the largest insider stakeholder in Electronic Arts, will be rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The commitment to the massive deal is inline with recent activity by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, wrote Andrew Marok of Raymond James.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Saudi PIF has been a very active player in the video gaming market since 2022, taking minority stakes in most scaled public video gaming publishers, and also outright purchases of companies like ESL, FACEIT, and Scopely,” he wrote. “The PIF has made its intentions to scale its gaming arm, Savvy Gaming Group, clear, and the EA deal would represent the biggest such move to date by some distance.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic Arts would be taken private and its headquarters will remain in Redwood City, California.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The total value of the deal eclipses the $32 billion price paid to take Texas utility TXU private in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the transaction closes as anticipated, it will end EA’s 36-year history as a publicly traded company that began with its shares ending its first day of trading at a split-adjusted 52 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IPO came seven years after EA was founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, who began playing analog versions of baseball and football made by “Strat-O-Matic” as a teenager during the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CEO Andrew Wilson has led the company since 2013 and he will remain in that role, the firms said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future,” said Kushner, who serves as CEO of Affinity Partners. “I’ve admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games — and now enjoys them with his kids — I couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This marks the second high-profile deal involving Silver Lake and a technology company with a legion of loyal fans in recent weeks. Silver Lake is also part of a newly formed joint venture spearheaded by Oracle involved in a deal to take over the U.S. oversight of TikTok’s social video platform, although all the details of that complex transaction haven’t been divulged yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Silver Lake has also previously bought out two other well-known technology companies, the now-defunct video calling service Skype in a $1.9 billion deal completed in 2009, and a $24.9 billion buyout of personal computer maker Dell in 2013. After Dell restructured its operations as a private company, it returned to the stock market with publicly traded shares in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By going private, EA will be able to reprogram its operations without being subjected to the investment pressures and scrutiny that sometimes compel publicly held companies to make short-sighted decisions aimed at meeting quarterly financial targets. Although its video games still have a fervent following, EA’s annual revenues have been stagnant during the past three fiscal years, hovering from $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of its biggest rivals Activision Blizzard was snapped up by technology powerhouse Microsoft for nearly $69 billion in 2023, while the competition from mobile video game makers such as Epic Games has intensified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After being taken private, formerly public companies often undergo extensive cost-cutting that includes layoffs, although there has been no indication that will be the case with EA. After jettisoning about 5% of its workforce in 2024, EA ended March with 14,500 employees and then laid off several hundred people in May.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2027. It still needs approval from EA shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EA’s stock rose more than 5% before the opening bell.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to introduce BrowserPod a WebAssembly-based, in-browser container technology that runs full-stack development environments across multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod is a generalised, more powerful alternative to WebContainers, with advanced networking capabilities and flexible multi-runtime support. Containers, called Pods, run completely client-side. At their core there is a flexible WebAssembly-based engine that can execute multiple programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Pod can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run multiple processes or services in parallel, with real concurrency powered by WebWorkers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access a scalable block-based filesystem with privacy-preserving browser-local persistence.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose virtualized HTTP / REST services to the internet via Portals&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pods are fast booting, since no provision of server-side resources is required. Moreover, multiple Pods can run in each browser tab, enabling complex deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod is conceptually similar to WebContainers, but is designed from the ground up to be language-agnostic, to support inbound networking, and to be integrated within the Leaning Technologies ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod will be released in late November, with an initial focus on Node.js environments and a well defined path to support additional stacks, with Python and Ruby as immediate priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further capabilities will become available later by integrating BrowserPod with CheerpX, our x86-to-WebAssembly virtualization engine. In particular, we plan to support React Native environments in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is BrowserPod for?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod is designed to run complete development environments in the browser, without installing local helper applications or dedicated server-side resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical use case of BrowserPod, exemplified by this demo, would be a browser-based IDE that can run a preview server, for example via &lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;. The preview server runs fully in the browser, with each update to files being reflected in the virtualized environment. As files are updated the normal Hot Module Replacement triggers, updating the preview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The application preview is not just available in the same browser session, but is exposed to the internet via a Portal, a seamless solution to allow direct public access to any HTTP service running inside a Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portals make it possible to achieve real cross-device testing of applications and even pre-release sharing of test URLs with external users, including early adopters, stakeholders and clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod’s initial focus will be on Node.js environments, which are supported via a complete build of Node.js, compiled to WebAssembly and virtualized in the browser. BrowserPod will support multiple versioned runtimes, with Node.js 22 being included in the first release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This high-fidelity approach ensures that applications developed in BrowserPod containers will behave the same when migrated to production, making it possible to build real-world applications in Pods, not just prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod is a great fit for web-based IDEs, educational environments, interactive documentation websites and AI coding Agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does BrowserPod work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod builds on our years long experience in delivering high performance in-browser virtualization via WebVM. WebVM is powered by CheerpX, our x86-to-WebAssembly virtualization engine, and it has been the most popular tool we have released so far, with 15k+ stars on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make BrowserPod possible we have rearchitectured CheerpX to separate its two main components: the x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler engine, and the Linux system call emulation layer. This emulation layer, that we are calling CheerpOS internally, is now shared across CheerpX and BrowserPod and, down the line, it will become a foundation layer across all our products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CheerpOS is effectively a WebAssembly kernel that allows unmodified C/C++ code for Linux to run in the browser. In the context of BrowserPod it is used to provide a unified view of filesystem and access to networking across the multiple processes running in a Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of this kernel layer, we compile the C++ source code of Node.js, with minimal changes, to a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript. The use of JavaScript is specific to Node.js and provides the required shortcut to run JavaScript payloads natively in the browser itself, which is critical for high performance execution of Node.js environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other stacks, such as Python and Ruby on Rails, will instead run as pure WebAssembly applications on top of the CheerpOS kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Licensing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod will come with a generous free license with attribution, available for non-commercial users and technical evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A transparent pay-as-you-go model will be available for any use and purpose, including companies working on AI codegen tools. Pricing will be announced at release time and it will be very affordable to maximize the adoption of this technology, with discounts available for educational and non-profit use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Enterprise license will also be available for self-hosting and commercial support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;General Availability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial release of BrowserPod will become generally available in late November - early December 2025, with support for Node.js 22.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the following year, we have planned several additional releases, including support for multiple Node.js versions, support for Python and Ruby on Rails, and eventually support for React Native environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To receive up-to-date information on BrowserPod, make sure to register on our website. We plan to extend an early adopter program to a selected subset of registered users and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information on all our products and technologies, please join our Discord. Most members of the development team are active there and ready to answer any question you might have. You can also follow us on X and LinkedIn for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BrowserPod is currently in the final stages of development, and we are thrilled to see what the community will build on top of this technology when it is released in late November.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaning Technologies mission statement is “Run anything on the browser”, and BrowserPod is an important milestone along this journey. It will also not be the last and we have great ambitions for our ecosystem as we migrate to the unified CheerpOS foundational layer. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Kagi News&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive daily press review with global news. Fully private, with sources openly curated by our community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News is broken. We all know it, but we’ve somehow accepted it as inevitable. The endless notifications. The clickbait headlines designed to trigger rather than inform, driven by relentless ad monetization. The exhausting cycle of checking multiple apps throughout the day, only to feel more anxious and less informed than when we started. This isn’t what news was supposed to be. We can do better, and create what news should have been all along: pure, essential information that respects your intelligence and time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our approach: Signal over noise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kagi News operates on a simple principle: understanding the world requires hearing from the world. Every day, our system reads thousands of community curated RSS feeds from publications across different viewpoints and perspectives. We then distill this massive information into one comprehensive daily briefing, while clearly citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We strive for diversity and transparency of resources and welcome your contributions to widen perspectives. This multi-source approach helps reveal the full picture beyond any single viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design principles that put readers first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One daily update: We publish once per day around noon UTC, creating a natural endpoint to news consumption. This is a deliberate design choice that turns news from an endless habit into a contained ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five-minute complete understanding: Our briefings cover everything important in just five minutes. No endless scrolling. No attention hijacking. You read, understand, and move on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversity over echo chambers: Rather than personalizing feeds to match existing preferences, we expose readers to the full spectrum of global perspectives. This approach breaks down information silos instead of reinforcing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy by design: Your reading habits belong to you. We don’t track, profile, or monetize your attention. You remain the customer and not the product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Community-driven sources: Our news sources are open source and community-curated through our public GitHub repository. Anyone can propose additions, flag problems, or suggest improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customizable: In your settings, you can select and reorder categories to match your interests and priorities. You can also adjust the number of stories shown, as well as dragging to re-order various sections, so that your briefing is focused on the depth and topics that matter most to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News in your language: You can choose your preferred interface and content language. News stories are generated in their original source language, and then translated using Kagi Translate. The default mode shows regional stories in their original language without translation, and all other ones in your browser’s language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical implementation that respects publishers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t scrape content from websites. Instead, we use publicly available RSS feeds that publishers choose to provide. Publishers decide what content appears in their feeds; some include full articles, others only titles or summaries. We respect those choices completely. We’re working within the ecosystem publishers have created rather than circumventing their intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ready to experience news differently?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re tired of news that makes you feel worse about the world while teaching you less about it, we invite you to try a different approach with Kagi News, so download it today:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-news"/><published>2025-09-30T15:09:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45426673</id><title>AI will happily design the wrong thing for you</title><updated>2025-09-30T16:12:44.158133+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="21de58151a65acb0"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI will happily design the wrong thing for you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I need to clear something up about my book, “Products People Actually Want.” When I write about how “anyone can build anything” now, some people assume I’m anti-AI. That I think these tools are ruining design or product development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s not it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI tools are incredible leverage. They make me think faster, broader, and help me produce better work. But like any creative partner or colleague, this doesn’t happen out of the gate. I’ve spent hours—days—training my AI on how we write at Summer Health so the tone is right. I’ve taught it our business model. I tweak its suggestions to better match the experience we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t that AI exists. The problem is how most people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The real issue with “anyone can build anything”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My book focuses on a specific problem: people building things without knowing if anyone actually needs them. When the barrier to building drops to zero, we get flooded with products that work fine but solve problems that don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s a second issue too. While AI can help you get started quickly, it won’t build something ready for mass market. Users’ expectations for polish and detail are much higher than what AI produces by default. You can spot AI-generated work from a mile away because it lacks the intentional decisions that make products feel right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combination is brutal: people building the wrong things, and building them poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just last week, we saw a perfect example. Food influencer Molly Baz discovered that Shopify was selling a website template featuring what she called “a sicko AI version of me.” The image—a woman in a red sweatshirt eating an onion ring in a butter-yellow kitchen—looked almost identical to her cookbook cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t really an AI problem, it’s a laziness problem that AI makes more tempting. What used to be someone using an image without permission now gets dressed up as “AI-generated content.” The ironic part? Creating something unique with AI tools is actually easier than trying to replicate someone else’s work. The tools are there. The capability is there. The only thing missing is the intention to actually create something new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How I actually use AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use AI tools extensively, but strategically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Granola for transcribing user research sessions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visual Electric for images that are impossible to find in stock libraries (like families that aren’t white middle class)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ChatGPT as a sparring partner and for writing better copy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cursor for building websites and prototypes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A custom copywriter agent trained on our brand voice&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s what I don’t do: I don’t use AI to replace thinking. I saw a tool recently that listens to user interviews and suggests follow-up questions. Tools like this make designers lazier, not better. You need genuine curiosity. You need to understand what you’re looking for before you can synthesize anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What AI is great at is helping you process large sets of information and pull out themes. But if you don’t understand your users and what they’re struggling with first, it’s impossible to prompt any AI tool for a real solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing about AI tools: if you don’t know what your customers want, if you as a designer don’t have a view on how to package it, AI will happily make all of that up for you. That just doesn’t mean it’s the right thing. AI fills in the blanks confidently, but those blanks are exactly where the real design work should happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The skills that actually matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The divide for engineers is easier to see: tools can help them code much faster, but it’s worthless if they can’t understand the generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For designers, the key skill going forward will be taste and curation. Understanding what you want to prompt before diving in. Knowing good work from generic work. Being able to refine and iterate until something feels intentional rather than automated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think designers who resist AI entirely will find themselves without jobs in the next five years. When you can use AI to speed up tedious tasks, what’s the reason for doing them manually?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But designers who treat AI like a magic button will struggle too. The ones who thrive will use AI as leverage—to think better, work faster, and explore more possibilities than they could alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI amplifies everything&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how I see it: AI is leverage. It amplifies whatever you bring to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you understand your users deeply, AI helps you explore more solutions. If you have good taste, AI helps you iterate faster. If you can communicate clearly, AI helps you refine that communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you don’t understand the problem you’re solving, AI just helps you build the wrong thing more efficiently. If you have poor judgment, AI amplifies that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future belongs to people who combine human insight with AI capability. Not people who think they can skip the human part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My book isn’t the antidote to AI. It’s about developing the judgment to use any tool—AI included—in service of building things people actually want. The better you understand users and business fundamentals, the better your AI-assisted work becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI didn’t create the problem of people building useless products. It just made it easier to build more of them, faster. The solution isn’t to avoid the tools. It’s to get better at the human parts of the job that the tools can’t do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My book Products People Actually Want is out now.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Charlie Javice, the founder of a startup company that sought to dramatically improve how students apply for financial aid, was sentenced Monday to more than seven years in prison for cheating JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by greatly exaggerating how many students it served.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Javice, 33, was sentenced in Manhattan federal court for her March conviction by Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, who said she committed “a large fraud” by duping the bank giant in the summer of 2021. She made false records that made it seem the company, called Frank, had over 4 million customers when it had fewer than 300,000, Hellerstein found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The judge said Javice had assembled a “very powerful list” of her charitable acts, which included organizing soup kitchens for the homeless when she was 7 years old and designing career programs for formerly incarcerated women.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In court papers, defense lawyers noted that Javice has faced extraordinary public scrutiny, reputational destruction and professional exile, “making her a household name” in the same way Elizabeth Holmes became synonymous with her blood-testing company, Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defense attorney Ronald Sullivan told Hellerstein that his client was very different from Holmes because what she created actually worked, unlike Holmes, “who did not have a real company” and whose product “in fact endangered patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In seeking a 12-year prison sentence for Javice, prosecutors cited a 2022 text Javice sent to a colleague in which she called it “ridiculous” that Holmes got over 11 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hellerstein largely dismissed arguments that he should be lenient because the acquisition pitted “a 28-year-old versus 300 investment bankers from the largest bank in the world,” as Sullivan put it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, the judge criticized the bank, saying “they have a lot to blame themselves” after failing to do adequate due diligence. He quickly added, though, that he was “punishing her conduct and not JPMorgan’s stupidity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sullivan said the bank rushed its negotiations because it feared another bank would acquire Frank first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A prosecutor, Micah Fergenson, though, said JPMorgan “didn’t get a functioning business” in exchange for its investment. “They acquired a crime scene.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fergenson said Javice was driven by greed when she saw that she could pocket $29 million from the sale of her company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ms. Javice had it dangling in front of her and she lied to get it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given a chance to speak, Javice said she was “haunted that my failure has transformed something meaningful into something infamous.” She said she “made a choice that I will spend my entire life regretting.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Javice, sometimes speaking through tears, apologized and sought forgiveness from “all the people touched or tarnished by my actions,” including JPMorgan shareholders, Frank employees and investors, along with her family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Javice, who lives in Florida, has been free on $2 million bail since her 2023 arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At trial, Javice, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, was convicted of conspiracy, bank fraud and wire fraud charges. Her lawyers had argued that JPMorgan went after Javice because it had buyer’s remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In her mid-20s, Javice founded Frank, a company with software that promised to simplify the arduous process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a complex government form used by students to apply for aid for college or graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frank’s backers included venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg. The company said its offering, akin to online tax preparation software, could help students maximize financial aid while making the application process less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank’s profile, once appearing on Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list before JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Javice was among a number of young tech executives who vaulted to fame with supposedly disruptive or transformative companies, only to see them collapse amid questions about whether they had engaged in puffery and fraud while dealing with investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In their pre-sentence submission, prosecutors wrote that they were requesting a lengthy prison sentence to send a message that fraud in the sale of startup companies is “no less blameworthy than other types of fraud and will be punished accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors added that the message was “desperately needed” because of “an alarming trend of founders and executives of small startup companies engaging in fraud, including making misrepresentations about their companies’ core products or services, in order to make their companies attractive targets for investors and/or buyers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years I used the Julia programming language for transforming, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data, doing statistics, and performing simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I published a handful of open-source packages for things like signed distance fields, nearest-neighbor search, and Turing patterns (among others), made visual explanations of Julia concepts like broadcasting and arrays, and used Julia to make the generative art on my business cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped using Julia a while ago, but it still sometimes comes up. When people ask, I tell them that I can no longer recommend it. I thought I’d write up my reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My conclusion after using Julia for many years is that there are too many correctness and composability bugs throughout the ecosystem to justify using it in just about any context where correctness matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Julia and its packages have the highest rate of serious correctness bugs of any programming system I’ve used, and I started programming with Visual Basic 6 in the mid-2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be useful to give some concrete examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some correctness issues I filed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are comparable issues filed by others:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;copyto!&lt;/code&gt; methods don’t check for aliasing&lt;p&gt;I would hit bugs of this severity often enough to make me question the correctness of any moderately complex computation in Julia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was particularly true when trying a novel combination of packages or functions — composing together functionality from multiple sources was a significant source of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the problems would be with packages that don’t compose together, and other times an unexpected combination of Julia’s features within a single package would unexpectedly fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I found that the Euclidean distance from the Distances package does not work with Unitful vectors. Others discovered that Julia’s function to run external commands doesn’t work with substrings. Still others found that Julia’s support for missing values breaks matrix multiplication in some cases. And that the standard library’s &lt;code&gt;@distributed&lt;/code&gt; macro didn’t work with OffsetArrays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OffsetArrays in particular proved to be a strong source of correctness bugs. The package provides an array type that leverages Julia’s flexible custom indices feature to create arrays whose indices don’t have to start at zero or one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using them would often result in out-of-bounds memory accesses, just like those one might encounter in C or C++. This would lead to segfaults if you were lucky, or, if you weren’t, to results that were quietly wrong. I once found a bug in core Julia that could lead to out-of-bounds memory accesses even when both the user and library authors wrote correct code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I filed a number of indexing-related issues with the JuliaStats organization, which stewards statistics packages like Distributions, which 945 packages depend on, and StatsBase, which 1,660 packages depend on. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of sampling methods are unsafe and incorrect in the presence of offset axes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitting a DiscreteUniform distribution can silently return an incorrect answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorrect uses of @inbounds cause miscalculation of statistics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing a Weights vector wrapping an offset array accesses out-of-bounds memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause behind these issues was not the indexing alone but its use together with another Julia feature, &lt;code&gt;@inbounds&lt;/code&gt;, which permits Julia to remove bounds checks from array accesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;function sum(A::AbstractArray)
    r = zero(eltype(A))
    for i in 1:length(A)
        @inbounds r += A[i] # ← 🌶
    end
    return r
end
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code above iterates &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from 1 to the length of the array. If you pass it an array with an unusual index range, it will access out-of-bounds memory: the array access was annotated with &lt;code&gt;@inbounds&lt;/code&gt;, which removed the bounds check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The example above shows how to use &lt;code&gt;@inbounds&lt;/code&gt; incorrectly. However, for years it was also the official example of how to use &lt;code&gt;@inbounds&lt;/code&gt; correctly. The example was situated directly above a warning explaining why it was incorrect:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That issue is now fixed, but it is worrying that &lt;code&gt;@inbounds&lt;/code&gt; can be so easily misused, causing silent data corruption and incorrect mathematical results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, issues like these were not confined to the mathematical parts of the Julia ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encountered library bugs while trying to accomplish mundane tasks like encoding JSON, issuing HTTP requests, using Arrow files together with DataFrames, and editing Julia code with Pluto, Julia’s reactive notebook environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I became curious if my experience was representative, a number of Julia users privately shared similar stories. Recently, public accounts of comparable experiences have begun to surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in this post Patrick Kidger describes his attempt to use Julia for machine learning research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty common to see posts on the Julia Discourse saying “XYZ library doesn’t work”, followed by a reply from one of the library maintainers stating something like “This is an upstream bug in the new version a.b.c of the ABC library, which XYZ depends upon. We’ll get a fix pushed ASAP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s Patrick’s experience tracking down a correctness bug (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember all too un-fondly a time in which one of my Julia models was failing to train. I spent multiple months on-and-off trying to get it working, trying every trick I could think of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually – eventually! – I found the error: Julia/Flux/Zygote was returning incorrect gradients. After having spent so much energy wrestling with points 1 and 2 above, this was the point where I simply gave up. Two hours of development work later, I had the model successfully training… in PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a discussion about the post others responded that they, too, had similar experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like @patrick-kidger, I have been bit by incorrect gradient bugs in Zygote/ReverseDiff.jl. This cost me weeks of my life and has thoroughly shaken my confidence in the entire Julia AD landscape. [...] In all my years of working with PyTorch/TF/JAX I have not once encountered an incorrect gradient bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I started working with Julia, I’ve had two bugs with Zygote which have slowed my work by several months. On a positive note, this has forced me to plunge into the code and learn a lot about the libraries I’m using. But I’m finding myself in a situation where this is becoming too much, and I need to spend a lot of time debugging code instead of doing climate research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given Julia’s extreme generality it is not obvious to me that the correctness problems can be solved. Julia has no formal notion of interfaces, generic functions tend to leave their semantics unspecified in edge cases, and the nature of many common implicit interfaces has not been made precise (for example, there is no agreement in the Julia community on what a number is).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Julia community is full of capable and talented people who are generous with their time, work, and expertise. But systemic problems like this can rarely be solved from the bottom up, and my sense is that the project leadership does not agree that there is a serious correctness problem. They accept the existence of individual isolated issues, but not the pattern that those issues imply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when Julia’s machine learning ecosystem was even less mature, for example, a co-founder of the language spoke enthusiastically about using Julia in production for self-driving cars:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while it’s possible that attitudes have shifted since I was an active member, the following quote from another co-founder, also made around the same time, serves as a good illustration of the perception gap (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the top-level take away here is not that Julia is a great language (although it is) and that they should use it for all the things (although that’s not the worst idea), but that its design has hit on something that has made a major step forwards in terms of our ability to achieve code reuse. It is actually the case in Julia that you can take generic algorithms that were written by one person and custom types that were written by other people and just use them together efficiently and effectively. This majorly raises the table stakes for code reuse in programming languages. Language designers should not copy all the features of Julia, but they should at the very least understand why this works so well, and be able to accomplish this level of code reuse in future designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever a post critiquing Julia makes the rounds, people from the community are often quick to respond that, while there have historically been some legitimate issues, things have improved substantially and most of the issues are now fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These responses often look reasonable in their narrow contexts, but the net effect is that people’s legitimate experiences feel diminished or downplayed, and the deeper issues go unacknowledged and unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My experience with the language and community over the past ten years strongly suggests that, at least in terms of basic correctness, Julia is not currently reliable or on the path to becoming reliable. For the majority of use cases the Julia team wants to service, the risks are simply not worth the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Julia was introduced to the world with an inspiring and ambitious set of goals. I still believe that they can, one day, be achieved—but not without revisiting and revising the patterns that brought the project to the state it is in today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Mitha Nandagopalan, Ben Cartwright-Cox, Imran Qureshi, Dan Luu, Elad Bogomolny, Zora Killpack, Ben Kuhn, and Yuriy Rusko for discussions and comments on earlier drafts of this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;cell&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt; Random Attractors&lt;lb/&gt; Found using Lyapunov Exponents &lt;/head&gt; Written by Paul Bourke&lt;lb/&gt; October 2001&lt;p&gt; Contribution by Philip Ham: attractor.basic&lt;lb/&gt; and Python implementation by Johan Bichel Lindegaard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This document is "littered" with a selection of attractors found using the techniques described. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In order for a system to exhibit chaotic behaviour it must be non linear. Representing chaotic systems on a screen or on paper leads one to considering a two dimensional system, an equation in two variables. One possible two dimensional non-linear system, the one used here, is the quadratic map defined as follows. &lt;/p&gt; xn+1 = a0 + a1 xn + a2 xn2 + a3 xn yn + a4 yn + a5 yn2 &lt;lb/&gt; yn+1 = b0 + b1 xn + b2 xn2 + b3 xn yn + b4 yn + b5 yn2 &lt;p&gt; The standard measure for determining whether or not a system is chaotic is the Lyapunov exponent, normally represented by the lambda symbol. Consider two close points at step n, xn and xn+dxn. At the next time step they will have diverged, namely to xn+1 and xn+1+dxn+1. It is this average rate of divergence (or convergence) that the Lyapunov exponent captures. Another way to think about the Lyapunov exponent is as the rate at which information about the initial conditions is lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are as many Lyapunov exponents as dimensions of the phase space. Considering a region (circle, sphere, hypersphere, etc) in phase space then at a later time all trajectories in this region form an n-dimensional elliptical region. The Lyapunov exponent can be calculated for each dimension. When talking about a single exponent one is normally referring to the largest, this convention will be assumed from now onwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Lyapunov exponent is positive then the system is chaotic and unstable. Nearby points will diverge irrespective of how close they are. Although there is no order the system is still deterministic! The magnitude of the Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity to initial conditions, the primary characteristic of a chaotic system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Lyapunov exponent is less than zero then the system attracts to a fixed point or stable periodic orbit. These systems are non conservative (dissipative). The absolute value of the exponent indicates the degree of stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Lyapunov exponent is zero then the system is neutrally stable, such systems are conservative and in a steady state mode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To create the chaotic attractors shown on this page each parameter an and bn in the quadratic equation above is chosen at random between some bounds (+- 2 say). The system so specified is generated by iterating for some suitably large number of time steps (eg; 100000) steps during which time the image is created and the Lyapunov exponent computed. Note that the first few (1000) timesteps are ignored to allow the system to settle into its "natural" behaviour. If the Lyapunov exponent indicates chaos then the image is saved and the program moves on to the next random parameter set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are a number of ways the series may behave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may converge to a single point, called a fixed point. These can be detected by comparing the distances between successive points. For numerical reasons this is safer than relying on the Lyapunov exponent which may be infinite (logarithm of 0)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may diverge to infinity, for the range (+- 2) used here for each parameter this is the most likely event. These are also easy to detect and discard, indeed they need to be in order to avoid numerical errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will form a periodic orbit, these are identified by their negative Lyapunov exponent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will exhibit chaos, filling in some region of the plane. These are the solutions that "look good" and the ones we wish to identify with the Lyapunov exponent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt; It should be noted that there may be visually appealing structures that are not chaotic attractors. That is, the resulting image is different for different initial conditions and there is no single basin of attraction. It's interesting how we "see" 3 dimensional structures in these essentially 2 dimensional systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software used to create these images is given here: gen.c. On average 98% of the random selections of (an, bn) result in an infinite series. This is so common because of the range (-2 &amp;lt;= a,b &amp;lt;= 2) for each of the parameters a and b, the number of infinite cases will reduce greatly with a smaller range. About 1% were point attractors, and about 0.5% were periodic basins of attraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;&lt;p&gt; Image courtesy of Robert McGregor, Space Coast of Florida.
