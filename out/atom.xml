    &lt;p&gt;The Agent Client Protocol standardizes communication between code editors (IDEs, text-editors, etc.) and coding agents (programs that use generative AI to autonomously modify code).The protocol is still under development, but it should be complete enough to build interesting user experiences using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI coding agents and editors are tightly coupled but interoperability isn’t the default. Each editor must build custom integrations for every agent they want to support, and agents must implement editor-specific APIs to reach users. This creates several problems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration overhead: Every new agent-editor combination requires custom work&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limited compatibility: Agents work with only a subset of available editors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developer lock-in: Choosing an agent often means accepting their available interfaces&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ACP solves this by providing a standardized protocol for agent-editor communication, similar to how the Language Server Protocol (LSP) standardized language server integration.Agents that implement ACP work with any compatible editor. Editors that support ACP gain access to the entire ecosystem of ACP-compatible agents. This decoupling allows both sides to innovate independently while giving developers the freedom to choose the best tools for their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ACP assumes that the user is primarily in their editor, and wants to reach out and use agents to assist them with specific tasks.Agents run as sub-processes of the code editor, and communicate using JSON-RPC over stdio. The protocol re-uses the JSON representations used in MCP where possible, but includes custom types for useful agentic coding UX elements, like displaying diffs.The default format for user-readable text is Markdown, which allows enough flexibility to represent rich formatting without requiring that the code editor is capable of rendering HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readable version | Chinese translation | Korean translation | Turkish translation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a living document, last update: August 2025. Your contributions are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many buzzwords and best practices out there, but most of them have failed. We need something more fundamental, something that can't be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we feel confusion going through the code. Confusion costs time and money. Confusion is caused by high cognitive load. It's not some fancy abstract concept, but rather a fundamental human constraint. It's not imagined, it's there and we can feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we spend far more time reading and understanding code than writing it, we should constantly ask ourselves whether we are embedding excessive cognitive load into our code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to think in order to complete a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When reading code, you put things like values of variables, control flow logic and call sequences into your head. The average person can hold roughly four such chunks in working memory. Once the cognitive load reaches this threshold, it becomes much harder to understand things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's say we have been asked to make some fixes to a completely unfamiliar project. We were told that a really smart developer had contributed to it. Lots of cool architectures, fancy libraries and trendy technologies were used. In other words, the author had created a high cognitive load for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should reduce the cognitive load in our projects as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic - caused by the inherent difficulty of a task. It can't be reduced, it's at the very heart of software development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraneous - created by the way the information is presented. Caused by factors not directly relevant to the task, such as smart author's quirks. Can be greatly reduced. We will focus on this type of cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's jump straight to the concrete practical examples of extraneous cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will refer to the level of cognitive load as follows:&lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt;: fresh working memory, zero cognitive load&lt;code&gt;🧠++&lt;/code&gt;: two facts in our working memory, cognitive load increased&lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;: cognitive overload, more than 4 facts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brain is much more complex and unexplored, but we can go with this simplistic model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;if val &amp;gt; someConstant // 🧠+
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (condition2 || condition3) // 🧠+++, prev cond should be true, one of c2 or c3 has be true
    &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (condition4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !condition5) { // 🤯, we are messed up by this point
    ...
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce intermediate variables with meaningful names:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;isValid = val &amp;gt; someConstant
isAllowed = condition2 || condition3
isSecure = condition4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !condition5 
// 🧠, we don't need to remember the conditions, there are descriptive variables
if isValid &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isAllowed &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isSecure {
    ...
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;if isValid { // 🧠+, okay nested code applies to valid input only
    if isSecure { // 🧠++, we do stuff for valid and secure input only
        stuff // 🧠+++
    }
} &lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare it with the early returns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if !isValid
    return
 
if !isSecure
    return

// 🧠, we don't really care about earlier returns, if we are here then all good

stuff // 🧠+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can focus on the happy path only, thus freeing our working memory from all sorts of preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are asked to change a few things for our admin users: &lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AdminController extends UserController extends GuestController extends BaseController&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohh, part of the functionality is in &lt;code&gt;BaseController&lt;/code&gt;, let's have a look: &lt;code&gt;🧠+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Basic role mechanics got introduced in &lt;code&gt;GuestController&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;🧠++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Things got partially altered in &lt;code&gt;UserController&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;🧠+++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Finally we are here, &lt;code&gt;AdminController&lt;/code&gt;, let's code stuff! &lt;code&gt;🧠++++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, there's &lt;code&gt;SuperuserController&lt;/code&gt; which extends &lt;code&gt;AdminController&lt;/code&gt;. By modifying &lt;code&gt;AdminController&lt;/code&gt; we can break things in the inherited class, so let's dive in &lt;code&gt;SuperuserController&lt;/code&gt; first: &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prefer composition over inheritance. We won't go into detail - there's plenty of material out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method, class and module are interchangeable in this context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mantras like "methods should be shorter than 15 lines of code" or "classes should be small" turned out to be somewhat wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep module - simple interface, complex functionality&lt;lb/&gt; Shallow module - interface is relatively complex to the small functionality it provides&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having too many shallow modules can make it difficult to understand the project. Not only do we have to keep in mind each module responsibilities, but also all their interactions. To understand the purpose of a shallow module, we first need to look at the functionality of all the related modules. Jumping between such shallow components is mentally exhausting, linear thinking is more natural to us humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information hiding is paramount, and we don't hide as much complexity in shallow modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have two pet projects, both of them are somewhat 5K lines of code. The first one has 80 shallow classes, whereas the second one has only 7 deep classes. I haven't been maintaining any of these projects for one year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I came back, I realised that it was extremely difficult to untangle all the interactions between those 80 classes in the first project. I would have to rebuild an enormous amount of cognitive load before I could start coding. On the other hand, I was able to grasp the second project quickly, because it had only a few deep classes with a simple interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best components are those that provide powerful functionality yet have a simple interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;John K. Ousterhout&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interface of the UNIX I/O is very simple. It has only five basic calls:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(path, flags, permissions)
read(fd, buffer, count)
write(fd, buffer, count)
lseek(fd, offset, referencePosition)
close(fd)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modern implementation of this interface has hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Lots of complexity is hidden under the hood. Yet it is easy to use due to its simple interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deep module example is taken from the book A Philosophy of Software Design by John K. Ousterhout. Not only does this book cover the very essence of complexity in software development, but it also has the greatest interpretation of Parnas' influential paper On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules. Both are essential reads. Other related readings: A Philosophy of Software Design vs Clean Code, It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code, Small Functions considered Harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you think we are rooting for bloated God objects with too many responsibilities, you got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often, we end up creating lots of shallow modules, following some vague "a module should be responsible for one, and only one, thing" principle. What is this blurry one thing? Instantiating an object is one thing, right? So MetricsProviderFactoryFactory seems to be just fine. The names and interfaces of such classes tend to be more mentally taxing than their entire implementations, what kind of abstraction is that? Something went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make changes to our systems to satisfy our users and stakeholders. We are responsible to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A module should be responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what this Single Responsibility Principle is all about. Simply put, if we introduce a bug in one place, and then two different business people come to complain, we've violated the principle. It has nothing to do with the number of things we do in our module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even now, this rule can do more harm than good. This principle can be understood in as many different ways as there are individuals. A better approach would be to look at how much cognitive load it all creates. It's mentally demanding to remember that change in one place can trigger a chain of reactions across different business streams. And that's about it, no fancy terms to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shallow-deep module principle is scale-agnostic, and we can apply it to microservices architecture. Too many shallow microservices won't do any good - the industry is heading towards somewhat "macroservices", i.e., services that are not so shallow (=deep). One of the worst and hardest to fix phenomena is so-called distributed monolith, which is often the result of this overly granular shallow separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once consulted a startup where a team of five developers introduced 17(!) microservices. They were 10 months behind schedule and appeared nowhere close to the public release. Every new requirement led to changes in 4+ microservices. It took an enormous amount of time to reproduce and debug an issue in such a distributed system. Both time to market and cognitive load were unacceptably high. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this the right way to approach the uncertainty of a new system? It's enormously difficult to elicit the right logical boundaries in the beginning. The key is to make decisions as late as you can responsibly wait, because that is when you have the most information at hand. By introducing a network layer up front, we make our design decisions hard to revert right from the start. The team's only justification was: "The FAANG companies proved microservices architecture to be effective". Hello, you got to stop dreaming big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate argued that Linux's monolithic design was flawed and obsolete, and that a microkernel architecture should be used instead. Indeed, the microkernel design seemed to be superior "from a theoretical and aesthetical" point of view. On the practical side of things - three decades on, microkernel-based GNU Hurd is still in development, and monolithic Linux is everywhere. This page is powered by Linux, your smart teapot is powered by Linux. By monolithic Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-crafted monolith with truly isolated modules is often much more flexible than a bunch of microservices. It also requires far less cognitive effort to maintain. It's only when the need for separate deployments becomes crucial, such as scaling the development team, that you should consider adding a network layer between the modules, future microservices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We feel excited when new features got released in our favourite language. We spend some time learning these features, we build code upon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there are lots of features, we may spend half an hour playing with a few lines of code, to use one or another feature. And it's kind of a waste of time. But what's worse, when you come back later, you would have to recreate that thought process!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You not only have to understand this complicated program, you have to understand why a programmer decided this was the way to approach a problem from the features that are available. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statements are made by none other than Rob Pike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce cognitive load by limiting the number of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language features are OK, as long as they are orthogonal to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Thoughts from an engineer with 20 years of C++ experience ⭐️&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was looking at my RSS reader the other day and noticed that I have somewhat three hundred unread articles under the "C++" tag. I haven't read a single article about the language since last summer, and I feel great!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using C++ for 20 years for now, that's almost two-thirds of my life. Most of my experience lies in dealing with the darkest corners of the language (such as undefined behaviours of all sorts). It's not a reusable experience, and it's kind of creepy to throw it all away now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like, can you imagine, the token&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; has a different meaning in &lt;code&gt;requires ((!P&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; || !Q&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;))&lt;/code&gt; and in &lt;code&gt;requires (!(P&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; || Q&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;))&lt;/code&gt;. The first is the constraint disjunction, the second is the good-old logical OR operator, and they behave differently.&lt;p&gt;You can't allocate space for a trivial type and just&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; a set of bytes there without extra effort - that won't start the lifetime of an object. This was the case before C++20. It was fixed in C++20, but the cognitive load of the language has only increased.&lt;p&gt;Cognitive load is constantly growing, even though things got fixed. I should know what was fixed, when it was fixed, and what it was like before. I am a professional after all. Sure, C++ is good at legacy support, which also means that you will face that legacy. For example, last month a colleague of mine asked me about some behaviour in C++03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 20 ways of initialization. Uniform initialization syntax has been added. Now we have 21 ways of initialization. By the way, does anyone remember the rules for selecting constructors from the initializer list? Something about implicit conversion with the least loss of information, but if the value is known statically, then...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased cognitive load is not caused by a business task at hand. It is not an intrinsic complexity of the domain. It is just there due to historical reasons (extraneous cognitive load).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to come up with some rules. Like, if that line of code is not as obvious and I have to remember the standard, I better not write it that way. The standard is somewhat 1500 pages long, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By no means I am trying to blame C++. I love the language. It's just that I am tired now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to 0xd34df00d for writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the backend we return:&lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; for expired jwt token&lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; for not enough access&lt;code&gt;418&lt;/code&gt; for banned users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers on the frontend use backend API to implement login functionality. They would have to temporarily create the following cognitive load in their brains:&lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; is for expired jwt token // &lt;code&gt;🧠+&lt;/code&gt;, ok just temporary remember it&lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; is for not enough access // &lt;code&gt;🧠++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;418&lt;/code&gt; is for banned users // &lt;code&gt;🧠+++&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers would (hopefully) introduce some kind &lt;code&gt;numeric status -&amp;gt; meaning&lt;/code&gt; dictionary on their side, so that subsequent generations of contributors wouldn't have to recreate this mapping in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then QA engineers come into play: "Hey, I got &lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt; status, is that expired token or not enough access?"
QA engineers can't jump straight to testing, because first they have to recreate the cognitive load that the engineers on the backend once created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why hold this custom mapping in our working memory? It's better to abstract away your business details from the HTTP transfer protocol, and return self-descriptive codes directly in the response body:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "code": "jwt_has_expired"
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive load on the frontend side: &lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt; (fresh, no facts are held in mind)&lt;lb/&gt; Cognitive load on the QA side: &lt;code&gt;🧠&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same rule applies to all sorts of numeric statuses (in the database or wherever) - prefer self-describing strings. We are not in the era of 640K computers to optimise for memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People spend time arguing between&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;403&lt;/code&gt;, making decisions based on their own mental models. New developers are coming in, and they need to recreate that thought process. You may have documented the "whys" (ADRs) for your code, helping newcomers to understand the decisions made. But in the end it just doesn't make any sense. We can separate errors into either user-related or server-related, but apart from that, things are kind of blurry.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. It's often mentally taxing to distinguish between "authentication" and "authorization". We can use simpler terms like "login" and "permissions" to reduce the cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not repeat yourself - that is one of the first principles you are taught as a software engineer. It is so deeply embedded in ourselves that we can not stand the fact of a few extra lines of code. Although in general a good and fundamental rule, when overused it leads to the cognitive load we can not handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, everyone builds software based on logically separated components. Often those are distributed among multiple codebases representing separate services. When you strive to eliminate any repetition, you might end up creating tight coupling between unrelated components. As a result changes in one part may have unintended consequences in other seemingly unrelated areas. It can also hinder the ability to replace or modify individual components without impacting the entire system. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the same problem arises even within a single module. You might extract common functionality too early, based on perceived similarities that might not actually exist in the long run. This can result in unnecessary abstractions that are difficult to modify or extend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Pike once said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little copying is better than a little dependency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are tempted to not reinvent the wheel so strong that we are ready to import large, heavy libraries to use a small function that we could easily write by ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All your dependencies are your code. Going through 10+ levels of stack trace of some imported library and figuring out what went wrong (because things go wrong) is painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of "magic" in frameworks. By relying too heavily on a framework, we force all upcoming developers to learn that "magic" first. It can take months. Even though frameworks enable us to launch MVPs in a matter of days, in the long run they tend to add unnecessary complexity and cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, at some point frameworks can become a significant constraint when faced with a new requirement that just doesn't fit the architecture. From here onwards people end up forking a framework and maintaining their own custom version. Imagine the amount of cognitive load a newcomer would have to build (i.e. learn this custom framework) in order to deliver any value. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By no means do we advocate to invent everything from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can write code in a somewhat framework-agnostic way. The business logic should not reside within a framework; rather, it should use the framework's components. Put a framework outside of your core logic. Use the framework in a library-like fashion. This would allow new contributors to add value from day one, without the need of going through debris of framework-related complexity first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain engineering excitement about all this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I myself was a passionate advocate of Hexagonal/Onion Architecture for years. I used it here and there and encouraged other teams to do so. The complexity of our projects went up, the sheer number of files alone had doubled. It felt like we were writing a lot of glue code. On ever changing requirements we had to make changes across multiple layers of abstractions, it all became tedious. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is supposed to hide complexity, here it just adds indirection. Jumping from call to call to read along and figure out what goes wrong and what is missing is a vital requirement to quickly solve a problem. With this architecture’s layer uncoupling it requires an exponential factor of extra, often disjointed, traces to get to the point where the failure occurs. Every such trace takes space in our limited working memory. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This architecture was something that made intuitive sense at first, but every time we tried applying it to projects it made a lot more harm than good. In the end, we gave it all up in favour of the good old dependency inversion principle. No port/adapter terms to learn, no unnecessary layers of horizontal abstractions, no extraneous cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think that such layering will allow you to quickly replace a database or other dependencies, you're mistaken. Changing the storage causes lots of problems, and believe us, having some abstractions for the data access layer is the least of your worries. At best, abstractions can save somewhat 10% of your migration time (if any), the real pain is in data model incompatibilities, communication protocols, distributed systems challenges, and implicit interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a sufficient number of users of an API,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;it does not matter what you promise in the contract:&lt;lb/&gt;all observable behaviors of your system&lt;lb/&gt;will be depended on by somebody.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did a storage migration, and that took us about 10 months. The old system was single-threaded, so the exposed events were sequential. All our systems depended on that observed behaviour. This behavior was not part of the API contract, it was not reflected in the code. A new distributed storage didn't have that guarantee - the events came out-of-order. We spent only a few hours coding a new storage adapter, thanks to an abstraction. We spent the next 10 months on dealing with out-of-order events and other challenges. It's now funny to say that abstractions helps us replace components quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why pay the price of high cognitive load for such a layered architecture, if it doesn't pay off in the future? Plus, in most cases, that future of replacing some core component never happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These architectures are not fundamental, they are just subjective, biased consequences of more fundamental principles. Why rely on those subjective interpretations? Follow the fundamental rules instead: dependency inversion principle, single source of truth, cognitive load and information hiding. Your business logic should not depend on low-level modules like database, UI or framework. We should be able to write tests for our core logic without worrying about the infrastructure, and that's it. Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not add layers of abstractions for the sake of an architecture. Add them whenever you need an extension point that is justified for practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layers of abstraction aren't free of charge, they are to be held in our limited working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domain-driven design has some great points, although it is often misinterpreted. People say, "We write code in DDD", which is a bit strange, because DDD is more about the problem space rather than the solution space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitous language, domain, bounded context, aggregate, event storming are all about problem space. They are meant to help us learn the insights about the domain and extract the boundaries. DDD enables developers, domain experts and business people to communicate effectively using a single, unified language. Rather than focusing on these problem space aspects of DDD, we tend to emphasise particular folder structures, services, repositories, and other solution space techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are that the way we interpret DDD is likely to be unique and subjective. And if we build code upon this understanding, i.e., if we create a lot of extraneous cognitive load - future developers are doomed. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team Topologies provides a much better, easier to understand framework that helps us split the cognitive load across teams. Engineers tend to develop somewhat similar mental models after learning about Team Topologies. DDD, on the other hand, seems to be creating 10 different mental models for 10 different readers. Instead of being common ground, it becomes a battleground for unnecessary debates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that familiarity is not the same as simplicity. They feel the same — that same ease of moving through a space without much mental effort — but for very different reasons. Every “clever” (read: “self-indulgent”) and non-idiomatic trick you use incurs a learning penalty for everyone else. Once they have done that learning, then they will find working with the code less difficult. So it is hard to recognise how to simplify code that you are already familiar with. This is why I try to get “the new kid” to critique the code before they get too institutionalised!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the previous author(s) created this huge mess one tiny increment at a time, not all at once. So you are the first person who has ever had to try to make sense of it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my class I describe a sprawling SQL stored procedure we were looking at one day, with hundreds of lines of conditionals in a huge WHERE clause. Someone asked how anyone could have let it get this bad. I told them: “When there are only 2 or 3 conditionals, adding another one doesn’t make any difference. By the time there are 20 or 30 conditionals, adding another one doesn’t make any difference!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no “simplifying force” acting on the code base other than deliberate choices that you make. Simplifying takes effort, and people are too often in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dan North for his comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've internalized the mental models of the project into your long-term memory, you won't experience a high cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more mental models there are to learn, the longer it takes for a new developer to deliver value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you onboard new people on your project, try to measure the amount of confusion they have (pair programming may help). If they're confused for more than ~40 minutes in a row - you've got things to improve in your code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you keep the cognitive load low, people can contribute to your codebase within the first few hours of joining your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How Instagram scaled to 14 million users with only 3 engineers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The companies where we were like ”woah, these folks are smart as hell” for the most part failed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;One function that wires up the entire system. If you want to know how the system works - go read it&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;These architectures are quite boring and easy to understand. Anyone can grasp them without much mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involve junior developers in architecture reviews. They will help you to identify the mentally demanding areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining software is hard, things break and we would need every bit of mental effort we can save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a moment that what we inferred in the second chapter isn’t actually true. If that’s the case, then the conclusion we just negated, along with the conclusions in the previous chapter that we had accepted as valid, might not be correct either. &lt;code&gt;🤯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel it? Not only do you have to jump all over the article to get the meaning (shallow modules!), but the paragraph in general is difficult to understand. We have just created an unnecessary cognitive load in your head. Do not do this to your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should reduce any cognitive load above and beyond what is intrinsic to the work we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Pike&lt;lb/&gt;Nice article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrej Karpathy (ChatGPT, Tesla)&lt;lb/&gt;Nice post on software engineering. Probably the most true, least practiced viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk&lt;lb/&gt;True.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addy Osmani (Chrome, the most complex software system in the world)&lt;lb/&gt;I've seen countless projects where smart developers created impressive architectures using the latest design patterns and microservices. But when new team members tried to make changes, they spent weeks just trying to understand how everything fits together. The cognitive load was so high that productivity plummeted and bugs multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony? Many of these complexity-inducing patterns were implemented in the name of "clean code."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really matters is reducing unnecessary cognitive burden. Sometimes this means fewer, deeper modules instead of many shallow ones. Sometimes it means keeping related logic together instead of splitting it into tiny functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it means choosing boring, straightforward solutions over clever ones. The best code isn't the most elegant or sophisticated - it's the code that future developers (including yourself) can understand quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your article really resonates with the challenges we face in browser development. You're absolutely right about modern browsers being among the most complex software systems. Managing that complexity in Chromium is a constant challenge that aligns perfectly with many of the points you made about cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way we try to handle this in Chromium is through careful component isolation and well-defined interfaces between subsystems (like rendering, networking, JavaScript execution, etc.). Similar to your deep modules example with Unix I/O - we aim for powerful functionality behind relatively simple interfaces. For instance, our rendering pipeline handles incredible complexity (layout, compositing, GPU acceleration) but developers can interact with it through clear abstraction layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your points about avoiding unnecessary abstractions really hit home too. In browser development, we constantly balance between making the codebase approachable for new contributors while handling the inherent complexity of web standards and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one, even in a complex system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;antirez (Redis)&lt;lb/&gt;Totally agree about it :) Also, what I believe is missing from mentioned "A Philosophy of Software Design" is the concept of "design sacrifice". That is, sometimes you sacrifice something and get back simplicity, or performances, or both. I apply this idea continuously, but often is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good example is the fact that I always refused to have hash items expires. This is a design sacrifice because if you have certain attributes only in the top-level items (the keys themselves), the design is simpler, values will just be objects. When Redis got hash expires, it was a nice feature but required (indeed) many changes to many parts, raising the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is what I'm doing right now, Vector Sets, the new Redis data type. I decided that Redis would not be the source of truth about vectors, but that it can just take an approximate version of them, so I was able to do on-insert normalization, quantization without trying to retain the large floats vector on disk, and so forth. May vector DBs don't sacrifice the fact of remembering what the user put inside (the full precision vector).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just two random examples, but I apply this idea everywhere. Now the thing is: of course one must sacrifice the right things. Often, there are 5% features that account for a very large amount of complexity: that is a good thing to kill :D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A developer from the internet&lt;lb/&gt;You would not hire me... I sell myself on my track record of released enterprise projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked with a guy that could speak design patterns. I could never speak that way, though I was one of the few that could well understand him. The managers loved him and he could dominate any development conversation. The people working around him said he left a trail of destruction behind him. I was told that I was the first person that could understand his projects. Maintainability matters. I care most about TCO. For some firms, that's what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I logged into Github after not being there for a while and for some reason it took me to an article in a repository by someone that seemed random. I was thinking "what is this" and had some trouble getting to my home page, so I read it. I didn't really register it at the time, but it was amazing. Every developer should read it. It largely said that almost everything we've been told about programming best practices leads to excessive "cognitive load", meaning our minds are getting kicked by the intellectual demands. I've known this for a while, especially with the demands of cloud, security and DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also liked it because it described practices I have done for decades, but never much admit to because they are not popular... I write really complicated stuff and need all the help I can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider, if I'm right, it popped up because the Github folks, very smart people, though that developers should see it. I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

How would that work? If further changes are not accepted into mainline, but fs/bcachefs/ is not being removed thereof, then what exactly happens to it (the physical code living under that path)? Is it going to slowly bit-rot, with users being instructed to ignore in-tree code and use some other tree instead?

The most important problem is how this upstreaming process will work. I can think of a few different alternatives, but the most straightforward option is for Kent to designate somebody. That person would then be responsible for all interaction with the kernel process, including sending emails, responding to code reviews, changing the code as requested (or telling Kent to do so and relaying his responses), etc. This strikes me as a highly difficult and thankless job that I certainly would not want to do. You could easily end up recreating exactly the same argument that Kent was regularly getting into (over release schedules, merge windows, etc.), but by proxy instead of directly. Ideally, Kent stops caring about the kernel's release processes altogether, and takes a mindset of "the kernel is [designee's] problem, and I don't have to deal with it aside from applying a few patches every now and then." Most of the alternatives are worse. If we instead suppose that the kernel takes bcachefs code without Kent's explicit approval or involvement, then the kernel upstream is a de facto fork of bcachefs (or they're just mirroring him, but there are governance problems with that). I'm not convinced that Linus et al. want to maintain a fork in this situation. Posted Aug 29, 2025 22:11 UTC (Fri) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (52 responses) And release process is something I care deeply about, for the simple reason that I support my code. I respond to nearly all of the user bug reports and stare at the test dashboards; I want users to have the most stable and trustworthy code I can provide. Broken release process is exactly why bcachefs-tools isn't in Debian as well; the package maintainer who took it upon himself to package bcachefs-tools in Debian put project rules ahead of shipping working code, then broke the build and sat in it - and I got stuck with the bug reports. So I'm equally curious where we go from here, I'm no more in the loop than anyone else. Exciting times, as the Chinese proverb says. Posted Aug 30, 2025 4:57 UTC (Sat) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] (4 responses) The distros are downstreams. If they want to package and ship your code, in whatever way they see fit, you've already given them permission to do so. And they are not shy about exercising that permission. I remember several years ago, jwz asked Debian to stop shipping XScreenSaver, because he disagreed with their practice of backporting fixes to old versions. Debian said no, and XScreenSaver is still in the repository today. As you might imagine, some rather harsh words were exchanged, but in the end, both sides went back to their respective corners of the internet and proceeded to mostly ignore each other. Linus, however, is not in the business of playing that game. If there's nobody actively maintaining (his copy of) bcachefs, then I find it hard to believe it's going to be allowed to stick around indefinitely. &amp;gt; So I'm equally curious where we go from here, I'm no more in the loop than anyone else. Exciting times, as the Chinese proverb says. My interpretation of events is that there are only three long-term paths that make sense here: * You accept that you cannot control what appears in Linus's tree, but would prefer that some recent-ish version of bcachefs is there (as opposed to no bcachefs or a very old bcachefs). You designate somebody as I've described upthread, they upstream patches at whatever rate Linus is willing to take them, and everybody is more or less willing to live with the result. I do not see any plausible outcome where you are allowed to control what appears in Linus's tree. He has very explicitly closed the door on that. For expository purposes, and because you are a functioning adult, I have assumed that you will accept this lack of control, but that does not actually matter - one of the above scenarios will inevitably play out, regardless of your opinion of it. The only choice you have at this point is whether it's the first bullet or one of the other two. I do not say this to be cruel. Based on your words in this and other threads, I genuinely believe that this process has been very painful for you, and I doubt you enjoy being reminded that Linus's tree does, in fact, belong to Linus (I'm sure other developers have screamed that at you enough times by now). Unfortunately, this is not a matter of right or wrong. It is a matter of power. You are aggrieved about something that neither Linus, nor anybody else on LKML, is prepared to recognize as an injury to you. Regardless of whether that is the right way or the wrong way of looking at it, Linus is going to conduct the kernel's release cycle as he sees fit. The *healthy* way of looking at it is to accept that that is not within your power to change, and redirect your attention to the things you can change. Posted Aug 30, 2025 16:30 UTC (Sat) by ttuttle (subscriber, #51118) [Link] Posted Aug 30, 2025 20:48 UTC (Sat) by linuxrocks123 (subscriber, #34648) [Link] (2 responses) But I disagree with him that you should focus any attention on that. The healthiest way to approach life is not to try to control what other people do, nor to think about what they might do in response to what you do. Rather, the healthiest approach to life, and the only way to be spiritually free in life, is to do whatever you want to do, so long as what you want to do is both legal and ethical. What other people may or may not do in response to that is their own problem, because, as long as what you are doing is legal, they can't make it your problem. (Unless you let them, so don't let them.) Applying that philosophy to this situation, I think you should just shrug, ignore Linus, and wash your hands of the in-tree version of bcachefs. The in-tree version of the code is what someone else is doing, not what you're doing, so it's not your problem. DKMS will work fine for you. Btw, I have a question for you, because I am interested in bcachefs but have not tried it yet. What I want out of my filesystem is as much speed as possible: because I have backups, I have no concern about data integrity after an unclean shutdown. I currently use ext4 with no journaling and the following knobs set in sysctl.conf: vm.dirty_ratio = 90 I also have libeatmydata.so listed in ld.so.preload to make sure programs can't override my preference for speed by calling fsync(). Given my preferences, would you recommend bcachefs for me over my current ext4-based setup, and, if so, how could I configure bcachefs for my desired speed versus integrity tradeoff? Thanks for any help. Posted Aug 30, 2025 23:41 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] Yup, agreed 100%. My goal is to develop a bulletproof modern filesystem that people can depend on; I said even before bcachefs was merged that I'm not going to let kernel drama take over my life, so I'm OK with bcachefs shipping as a DKMS module. But if you look at where this leaves Linux for filesystems, it is a sad state of affairs. XFS has been burning through maintainers; they're on their third, and it's not good for a project to be losing that continuity of leadership and experience, and "upstream burnout" (read: working with Linus) was the major factor, from speaking with them. btrfs is still eating filesystems - they may be better than they were, but I still see reports regularly, and they don't seem to be taking reliability seriously. It's starting to look like the Linux filesystem world in general is imploding, and at this point all I can do is put on a good pair of running shoes and hope DKMS works out. &amp;gt; Btw, I have a question for you, because I am interested in bcachefs but have not tried it yet. What I want out of my filesystem is as much speed as possible: because I have backups, I have no concern about data integrity after an unclean shutdown. I currently use ext4 with no journaling and the following knobs set in sysctl.conf: If speed is all you want you might not want to run bcachefs yet. On the one hand, benchmarks don't tell the whole story - I've had a lot of users tell me that things do feel more responsive on bcachefs than btrfs, but there are definitely areas where we're slower than we should be (e.g. journalling overhead is higher than it should be, and I have WIP stuff for that) and still some outright performance bugs to chase down. But robustness and reliability is waaaaaay more of a priority for me than performance, and the userbase seems to be more interested in erasure coding and the management stuff than performance, so it'll be awhile before I'm working on performance in earnest. Posted Aug 31, 2025 8:10 UTC (Sun) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] Just to clarify, I did not state that Kent *should* focus any attention on anything in particular. I was responding to Kent's comment, which implied that he wanted to focus on the kernel's release cycle: &amp;gt; And release process is something I care deeply about, for the simple reason that I support my code. I respond to nearly all of the user bug reports and stare at the test dashboards; I want users to have the most stable and trustworthy code I can provide. I was taking that statement as a given, not endorsing it as a "correct" thing for Kent to want. It's not my place to tell Kent what he should or should not want, so I restricted myself to talking about the likely consequences of that desire. I did state that Kent should accept that Linus's tree and the kernel release cycle are beyond Kent's ability to control. But that would seem to be a necessary prerequisite to Kent washing his hands of the matter (or at least, it would certainly help the medicine go down easier, don't you think?). Posted Aug 30, 2025 7:57 UTC (Sat) by paravoid (subscriber, #32869) [Link] (43 responses) Debian was not even close to the topic at hand, and yet you felt the need to bring it up, just to attack someone, and with information that is misrepresenting the truth. This is something you've done before, and you were very recently called out in lkml for it. Stop. To correct the record: bcachefs-tools is not in Debian because Kent was impossible to work with and personally attacked, smeared and/or alienated multiple sets of distinct contributors that attempted to work with him in good faith, one after another. It was ultimately removed from unstable because noone was able to get through. Source: I am one of them. Posted Aug 30, 2025 11:44 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (15 responses) He did so anyways, and then swapped out bindgen for an old version that was explicitly unsupported according to the Cargo.toml, which broke the build, and he sat on it and Debian users stopped getting updates (I didn't even see a report until months later). This resulted in users being unable to access their filesystems. There was briefly a buggy version of bcachefs-tools that couldn't pass mount options correctly; users in every other distro got a fix quickly, but Debian users did not - and we found out about this when a lot of users weren't able to mount in degraded mode after having a drive die. What you're doing is conflating technical criticism with personal, and then using that as an excuse to ramp up the drama. Technical criticism, including pointing out failures of processes, has to be ok for engineering to function, otherwise we don't learn from our mistakes. That can make for a harsh learning environment, but when you're shipping critical system components that have to work, that's what you signed up for; we have responsibilities. The person in question was warned explicitly that what he was doing was a bad idea; he could have at any point said "this is too complicated an issue for me to handle; I'll let someone else take this one" (and there are mechanisms in Debian process for obtaining exceptions to process rules that could have avoided this, by simply skipping the Rust dependency unbundling with a clear explanation of why); he ignored advice and plowed ahead, and a lot of people were affected by those actions. When we work on this kind of code, we have to be responsible for the work we do, including our mistakes. Posted Aug 30, 2025 14:25 UTC (Sat) by ma4ris8 (subscriber, #170509) [Link] (14 responses) Listen part: I'm trying to repeat roughly the same as you wrote above, to show that I listened you: First you state that maintainer switched Rust dependencies for the packaged versions from Debian. He changed Rust dependencies anyways, and then swapped out bindgen into older version, Important end question: Did I repeat (re-phrase in text) precisely what you wrote? Answer part: For me it sounds like there were some mistakes done by both you and others. How to communicate (listen) effectively, to heal relationships? This way of listening is mentioned in What I showed, is one way to restore human relationships, with Linus and others: If you get a backslash, you was just given an opportunity to listen the complaint. By doing this just very slightly to not burden others, I've seen that sometimes this listening technique helps on-line, in addition of meeting face to face. Posted Aug 30, 2025 18:21 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (13 responses) Why are you trying to bothsides this? You seem to have the facts straight, but I'm not at all clear on what you think I did wrong. All this was explained clearly, calmly and patiently to the Debian package maintainer when he started; he decided to do it his way, and when the breakage became apparent I asked if he was going to fix it and he just said "nope, too complicated" and walked off. So I got stuck with warning bcachefs users away from Debian, and he wrote a screed of a blog post about how impossible I am to work with. Sorry, but from where I sit that just looks crazy. I'm all about focusing on the human aspect, sitting down with people and having open and honest conversations. I do that regularly, and believe me I and others have tried ratcheting down the tensions, bringing the focus back to the technical and looking for ways to make this easier and take things in little steps. The whole rest of the 6.16 merge cycle after the journal_rewind fiasco was just that, from myself and others; we've tried to bridge the gap, bring the focus back to the technical, look for ways to make things work - it doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere. Posted Aug 30, 2025 21:00 UTC (Sat) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] (12 responses) You don't demonstrate any degree of understanding of why requirements other than your own matter. You talk about what the Debian maintainer did, and how you told them not to. You don't talk about why those requirements exist and what you did to help them meet those requirements. You act like the story begins and ends with "I told them no and they didn't obey". This is on par with what happens with the Linux kernel. You don't demonstrate and communicate that you understand requirements other than your own and place weight on them. You just act like they're obstacles to getting *your* requirements met, and try to work around them. Posted Aug 30, 2025 21:48 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (11 responses) It's not "he didn't obey", it's "he did something stupid that I warned him was a bad idea and then he didn't stick around to resolve the situation and a has to deal with the fallout". It's not an authority thing, it's just about making good decisions being responsible for your decisions. Posted Aug 30, 2025 22:09 UTC (Sat) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] (8 responses) Package upstreams vs Debian process typically ends with "your package is not more important than our consistency"; that is a reliably predictable outcome. If you want to *change* Debian process or policy, that's a conversation that requires a detailed case for doing so, which requires understanding of why the requirements are what they are, not just why you want them to be different. Posted Aug 30, 2025 22:43 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (7 responses) Posted Aug 31, 2025 1:29 UTC (Sun) by comex (subscriber, #71521) [Link] (6 responses) (1) In April 2024, Debian unstable was shipping too-old versions of some packages. In particular, bcachefs-tools wanted bindgen 0.69.4 (released upstream 2 months prior), while Debian unstable was shipping 0.66.1 (released upstream 8 months prior). (2) In April 2024, Debian unstable was shipping too-*new* versions of some packages. In particular, bcachefs-tools wanted rust-errno 0.2.x, while rust-errno 0.3.0 had released upstream 14 months prior, and Debian unstable was shipping 0.3.8. (3) Despite these conflicts happening in Debian unstable, the Debian maintainer seemed more concerned about how bcachefs-tools would be maintained in the future in Debian stable. To me these seem like three different problems with three different solutions. (1) If Debian unstable was shipping old versions of some dependencies, then Debian should have updated those packages. Perhaps other dependents would have broken with newer versions of the dependencies, but AFAICT there was no specific evidence of this. 2 months (the age of bindgen 0.69.4 at the time) sounds to me like a reasonable lead time for a dependency. If Debian’s processes make it too hard to update Rust packages at a reasonable pace *in unstable*, then maybe they need to be changed, but I don’t know whether that’s true or whether the issue was something else; perhaps the maintainer's stated lack of experience with Rust packaging. (2) If bcachefs-tools was depending on old versions of some packages, then bcachefs-tools should have been updated. The maintainer could have submitted a PR upstream. That would be easier said than done if this were something like Kubernetes [2], but in this case the blog post only cited 2 packages that needed to be updated. As for (3), I don’t fully understand the problem. Debian stable freezes the entire set of packages. That includes the Rust packages, but also bcachefs-tools and the kernel. Some Linux distros have “hardware enablement” branches where they upgrade the kernel separately from the rest of the system, but AFAIK Debian does not. So why would someone maintaining bcachefs-tools on stable care what is happening upstream? Overall - I'm sure there are some factors I'm missing. But every time I've seen this come up, even the knowledgeable commenters seem to smoosh the issue into "bcachefs-tools is not stable enough for Debian", and to me that really seems like an oversimplification and misunderstanding. Does anyone have additional light to shed? Sources: Posted Aug 31, 2025 1:49 UTC (Sun) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (3 responses) bcachefs-tools updates probably can't follow the Debian "hard freeze for two years" model, and this comes up in other critical system packages, too. _Maybe_ they can, but it's too early to be making those kinds of assumptions and locking us down any particular path. The big concern is that just because a user is running Debian stable they may be running a newer kernel (for drivers, generally), and we want bcachefs-tools to be in sync with the kernel. It's not strictly necessary, we have more compat options than other filesystems (due to in-kernel repair being first class), but it puts us in an uncomfortable situation. Debian may not have official "hardware enablement", but it's still commonplace to pull in a newer kernel from a different channel, and that's expected to work. The kernel has hard requirements about not breaking userspace for exactly the same reason; bcachefs takes the same approach. Upgrades and downgrades should always work; that's a huge part of what we've been working through in the experimental phase. If we have to ship/backport a new bcachefs-tools for Debian stable users, unbundling Rust dependencies at all completely breaks that. But the bigger point is that it's too early to even know what backports are going to like for bcachefs, and we don't want to be in Debian stable at all yet. _But_, for the people in Debian and are running bcachefs now, they still need a supported and working filesystem and process for shipping bugfixes. That's the issue that needs to be solved today for any Debian users to be running bcachefs, not "how do we support Debian stable users for the non-experimental version of bcachefs that will be getting backports and doesn't even exist yet". The other big thing to note that makes debundling really problematic is that Debian is not the only distro. If other distros were unbundling (thank god we got Fedora to agree not to), and their Rust library versions are not in sync - see where that puts us? The last think I want is to get sucked into dealing with is different distros with different conflicting library requirements. It's not the end of the world for things like rust-errno; I would have groaned at that one, but swapping that one out for a different version is unlikely to cause real breakage. Bindgen, OTOH - FFI stuff has the very real potential to introduce the nastiest sort of heisenbugs which won't be caught by the compiler (they have happened and they are _not_ fun), and even I wouldn't trust my test coverage to catch all of those - and Debian does not replicate that testing. Swapping out bindgen was actively dangerous, and never should have even been attempted. I specifically told the Debian package maintainer that that one was dangerous to change, and he did it anyways... Posted Aug 31, 2025 2:11 UTC (Sun) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (1 responses) We had another example of that from just yesterday: Arch flipped on LTO, and it turns out that produces a miscompilation, because the final link is now done by rustc which has different rules than C code about eliding bounds checks. This one was minor, it just caused the progress indicators on data jobs to display incorrectly, but it's quite the scary bug. If distros want to make these changes (and LTO is a perfectly fine thing in principle), we really want them contributed upstream so they can get proper testing and QA. Posted Aug 31, 2025 3:40 UTC (Sun) by jmalcolm (subscriber, #8876) [Link] Seems very reasonable Posted Aug 31, 2025 3:47 UTC (Sun) by jmalcolm (subscriber, #8876) [Link] Thank you for this. In my experience you have succeeded. &amp;gt; bcachefs-tools updates probably can't follow the Debian "hard freeze for two years" model Agreed. In a distro like Debian, I do not see how you adopt something like bcachefs until bcachefs itself has stabilized enough to flow into Debian Stable. If you are going to try, you have to be getting the kernel and userland from outside of Debian. &amp;gt; it's still commonplace to pull in a newer kernel from a different channel, and that's expected to work Sure. But when there is a userspace component, a "working" kernel is not enough. Posted Aug 31, 2025 9:14 UTC (Sun) by paravoid (subscriber, #32869) [Link] (1 responses) Originally bcachefs-tools was a C program. Jonathan Carter maintained it in Debian. At some point it gained optional Rust dependencies, some of which were not in Debian, and it looked difficult so Jonathan elected to opt-out of the Rust parts. The package was also poorly maintained, which I reported in all transparency to the BTS https://bugs.debian.org/1066929. I also talked a few times in private to Jonathan, and I understand and respect his circumstances. I stepped up to help out, in the Debian BTS and in private, to bring the package back to Debian standards and enable the Rust parts - this was https://bugs.debian.org/1060256. I also got in touch in private with the kernel maintainers (Salvatore Bonaccorso) as to enable bcachefs in the kernel package: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1054620#15 In terms of Rust dependencies: for some Debian was behind and/or missing; for several of them, Debian was ahead; most of them were spurious/cruft on the bcachefs tree and not actual dependencies. I engaged with upstream with PRs, #203, #204, #205, and worked with folks from the Debian Rust team to bring the rest of them to Debian. All were merged (except one of the three that Kent reauthored as-is, dropped any credit, and silently closed the MR. Whatever.). You can find a summary at https://bugs.debian.org/1060256 and also gave a similar summary to upstream with https://github.com/koverstreet/bcachefs-tools/issues/202 Steinar H. Gunderson did a ton of work of adjusting the package to enable the Rust dependencies, communicated promptly with the maintainer, and also build out-of-Debian packages for it for others to test. Him and I talked quite a bit with each other and talked about comaintaining the package. I know he had talked to upstream as well through IRC etc. In terms of bindgen: at the time bcachefs-tools was relying on a custom fork, bch_bindgen, of an older bindgen that Kent made, which we could potentially vendor, but it didn't seem right. Our work in Debian is to look at the whole ecosystem, and avoid carrying multiple forked versions that every upstream vendors, if possible. According to Kent IIRC it was also kind of a hack. (Note that the package worked without this fork + a revert of the commit before the fork. Just not on i386, plus it was a custom patch that we shouldn't carry.) So I brought this up on the bcachefs bug tracker, and another bcachefs contributor, Thomas Bertschinger, found a way to fix this struct packing/alignment issue in a Rust-upstream-acceptable way with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59154. He was awesome, and and him I had very collegial private exchanges about this. I'm not a Rust person, so I talked to a few folks in the Debian Rust team abut updating bindgen in Debian, from 0.66.1 to 0.69.4, but it's a complicated transition and it would take more time. Instead as a stopgap, I filed https://bugs.debian.org/1078698 with a backport the patch to 0.66.1 (cleanly applied). Rust folks uploaded 0.66.1-9 with this patch a few months later. This was the last blocker. Newer versions of bindgen found their way to Debian after that (trixie was released with 0.7.1). The package was going to be there in ~Oct 2024: latest version, all features enabled, no custom patches, no lagging dependencies. I'm 100% confident it would have made it into the trixie release. All in all, several people collaborated across the ecosystem to make this happen. The whole ecosystem benefited: bcachefs upstream became better as a result of this work, Debian shipped more and updated Rust software, Rust/bindgen upstream gained code to address a real user need. Several of us were in touch with each other in public and in private, collegial to each other, respecting each other's work, dragging each other forward when one of us was unable to make progress, either because of personal circumstances, lack of time, or lack of knowledge in a particular ecosystem. All in the collaborative spirit of large scale open source software development. Then Kent started throwing profanities and "PSAs" all around and started treating people like shit in public across multiple mediums, often talking them down in their absence, including unsubstantiated attacks in /r/bcachefs/ that he subsequently locked giving no opportunity for a rebuttal. I quoted one of these emails in another comment here. He also started, late in the game, bringing up Debian as a problem as a whole, its "lack of flexibility" and its policies around vendoring as the problem and... expecting Debian to change its Rust policy (right or wrong) across the board... for a leaf package for an experimental filesystem that ~noone is using. (Again, we had a perfectly working package at that time.). Kent around that time showed the same aggression to his peers and sense of entitlement (IMHO) in Linux, ultimately resulting in a CoC violation and public spats with Linus about the -rc merge policy respectively, so it became clear, at least to me, that this wasn't an isolated incident, and working with this individual is not how I want to be spending my limited, volunteer time. And that was that. All of us that had been involved in the Debian package halted our involvement, package was removed from unstable and orphaned and noone has picked it up yet. I don't know why Debian was brought up on LWN and in this thread specifically. This is another case of completely unrelated revisionist history-making in my book (same as it has been happening e.g upstream w/ btrfs) which is why I felt the need to intervene. HTH! Posted Aug 31, 2025 12:59 UTC (Sun) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] But you're leaving out the critical part, which is where bcachefs-tools updates stopped, a bugfix for option passing didn't go out (FFI bug, naturally), for months, I was not kept in the loop, and I found out when I started getting a bunch of bug reports from Debian users who couldn't mount after they'd lost a drive. All the work you're talking about regarding the Debian ecosystem: that's great, but if you're putting that ahead of the most basic "make sure things work for users", you got your priorities wrong. That's the screwup. And I didn't see anyone you mentioned showing any concern for the testing and QA aspects, the (very real) concerns with using a different version of bindgen introducing FFI bugs, and I didn't see any of you responding to the user bug reports that I got from people who couldn't mount their filesystems. This is the thing that you need to understand: if you cannot get these priorities straight, I do not want you anywhere near bcachefs or bcachefs-tools. Making sure things work for the end user comes first. All that work that you're talking about re: the custom bindgen fork, there was _no reason_ for that to take precedence over making sure package updates with bugfixes could go out. Package updates were working previously, that broke, and there were consequences for users. That PSA came out after I spoke with the package maintainer, asked him if he was going to resolve this, and got a flat "no". Debian was shipping a broken package, and with an unresponsive maintainer I had no other option but to tell bcachefs users to steer clear of Debian because things had gone so off the rails; my job is to make sure bcachefs users have working filesystems and this was a very clear breach of trust that I had no other way to resolve. Posted Aug 30, 2025 22:10 UTC (Sat) by lordsutch (guest, #53) [Link] (1 responses) If an upstream doesn't want to play by Debian's rules or thinks the release process is too slow, they can set up their own package repository. Posted Aug 30, 2025 23:42 UTC (Sat) by pizza (subscriber, #46) [Link] I'm sorry, but if "the distribution's rules" result in the distributed package being so broken that it directly leads to user data loss, then those rules are not fit for purpose. Fortunately for Debian, "the rules" provide a mechanism for exceptions where necessary. If a major data loss bug isn't sufficient to qualify for a necessary exception, then I repeat myself about those rules not being fit for purpose. Posted Aug 30, 2025 12:24 UTC (Sat) by muase (subscriber, #178466) [Link] (22 responses) I know it's not the distros' fault; it's simply how LTS has to work in practice – however I can understand the frustration that arises if there seems to be an opportunity to finally update a package(set)... and then that opportunity is missed, and now the dev knows that they have to endure those obsolete bug reports for another n-year release cycle. It definitely didn't read as "just to attack someone". &amp;gt; To correct the record: bcachefs-tools is not in Debian because Kent was impossible to work with and personally attacked, smeared and/or alienated multiple sets of distinct contributors that attempted to work with him in good faith, one after another. Tbh, the only personal attack I see here is from you; and as an outsider, this is not very informative – your frustration may be absolutely legit, but this reply doesn't suit your case. If the communication is public, do you have a link or something? :) Posted Aug 30, 2025 18:27 UTC (Sat) by paravoid (subscriber, #32869) [Link] (21 responses) Kent in https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bcachefs/wona7sjqodu7jgchtx... called part of a maintainer's job as "bullshit, make-work job", told Debian to "develop a better and more practical minded attitude" and to "stop wasting my time with this stupid bullshit and I can get back to real work". The issues we had spent a lot of our volunteer time to fix were very real issues, many of them upstream, and one in the Rust ecosystem. At the time this was sent, all issues were fixed, or were on the way to be fixed, and a recent bcachefs-tools package with all of the appropriate dependencies was a few weeks away from getting to Debian testing. bcachefs-tools was orphaned by its maintainer a few weeks later; myself and another contributor (the two of us had done all recent advancements), stopped investing our time as well. The package has remained orphaned since, for about a year. Anyone can pick it up, but noone has, and that's not because of technical difficulties (as far as packages go, it's pretty trivial). As an aside, the very existence of this thread was as a "PSA" to his users to avoid Debian and Fedora, telling them that "you'll want to be on a more modern distro". *Two weeks later*, he responded in https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/nxyp62x2ruommzyebdwincu26kmi... to Linus that he expects the "major distros" to pick up bcachefs soon. Whether he was dishonest or just naive, I'll leave that to your judgement. The above was just a small sample. There were literally dozens of responses of this style at time, random offensive comments etc., across multiple mediums (mailing lists, IRC, Reddit, etc.). I am not keeping a file though, as I don't feel the need to convince anyone with hard evidence. You don't know me, and I understand that my opinion may not be of much value to you. I hope, though, that you and others may see this as one tiny part of a broader pattern of countless long-time contributors across multiple projects expressing that they have been alienated and driven away by Kent's conduct and sense of entitlement, and that they have good reasons for it. Posted Aug 30, 2025 19:20 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (20 responses) But please do try to put yourself in my shoes; that was after getting a bunch of bug reports from Debian users, and there had been a _lot_ of fail at that point in how the Debian packaging was handled. I do have to reiterate: the unbundling of Rust dependencies should not have happened for bcachefs-tools, there was no technical reason for that, all my explanations were met with "but that's our policy", and no amount of reasoning was getting anywhere; and the Debian packager breaking the build and sitting on it just should not have happened. I do sincerely hope you can analyze how things went from the other end and ask yourself what could have been done better to avoid this, because from my end, this was an intensely frustrating issue, and it wasn't being taken seriously and it had very real effects. Before you start focusing on language and diplomacy, you really need ask yourself if the technical decisionmaking leading up to that point was sound. When we get breakage as bad as what happened with the Debian package, you can expect the kind of frustration I was voicing there, and "bullshit, make-work projects" still seems to accurately describe what Debain's been doing with Rust dependency unbundling. When we're dealing with critical system components, you cannot focus just on language and diplomacy and ignore the decisionmaking; that's ignoring our most basic responsibilities.

The fact that they resulted in someone deciding they no longer wish to work with you or put work into being the downstream maintainer of your software is an *unsurprising outcome*. &amp;gt; When we're dealing with critical system components, you cannot focus just on language and diplomacy and ignore the decisionmaking; that's ignoring our most basic responsibilities. You also cannot completely neglect language and diplomacy and understanding other people's requirements, either, as you absolutely did in the messages being quoted here. Your words will produce responses and actions from others. No amount of wishing things were different will enable you to say things that will predictably produce undesired actions and then have a leg to stand on when being annoyed that those predictable responses and actions happen. Your words are a lever to be used, just like your code. Write the words that produce the results you want, and if you want to be happier, learn to not resent that as a means of effecting change. To be clear: the words have to actually match the actions. You can't *just* say the right words but then have them mismatch your actions; down that path you'd find people whose words and truth lack even a passing familiarity. But it's important to, for instance, give people confidence that you care about the requirements they deal with, in some fashion *other* than "what windmill can I burn down so that you don't have to meet those requirements anymore and can do what I want instead".

It might have made sense 20 and 30 years ago that distributions religiously kept single versions of libraries when (nearly) everything was written in C and the number of "interesting" software was in hundreds or thousands range. Nowadays it no longer makes sense, there are hundrends of thousands of softwares around written in languages which don't really care what's in a distribution (especially if the developers of said software work on e.g. MacOS). There's no wonder the snap, flatpack, docker, curl |bash way of running/installing software is getting more popular. Posted Aug 31, 2025 8:20 UTC (Sun) by zejn (guest, #116440) [Link] You seem to subscribe to the religion of "sound technical decision making", which, honestly, for you as a provider of some software mostly means "hey this makes my life easier, I'm going to do more of this". "This" may be a dependency on a specific library and you'll require version X or maybe greater. It can also mean other things, and since you don't have a policy written down, to other people it often means "because he said so". Debian will unbundle everything it can, because it makes sense for it to do so. You can provide your own package repository, if you want, it's trivial. A lot of projects do so, for various reasons. &amp;gt; When we're dealing with critical system components, you cannot focus just on language and diplomacy and ignore the decisionmaking; that's ignoring our most basic responsibilities.

Posted Aug 31, 2025 9:56 UTC (Sun) by paravoid (subscriber, #32869) [Link] (1 responses) In terms of language and critical system components: there is a fair amount of published research on this topic. It does not agree with you. Language and respect are extremely important components. Fostering a culture of trust, respect and psychological safety is what makes systems safe. This is accomplished through open communication, clear language, demonstrating respect, encouraging participation, valuing contributions, contributors having no fear of retribution (among others). It has been proven time and again, in processes written in blood, as documented in (actual human life) safety reports -- whether it was Chernobyl, air crash investigations or other types of large scale accident portmosterms. Some of it captured in the field of "Crew Resource Management" (CRM) (in turn based on the principles of Cockpit Resource Management) , if you want to read more on this topic. To put it simply: if I jumped on a plane and heard the pilot telling his first officer "stop wasting my time with this stupid bullshit so that I can get back to real work"... I'd probably ask to get off the plane. But you do you. Just maybe stop stating that the reason bcachefs-tools is not in Debian (or the kernel, from what it looks like) is not a "broken release process". The reason is that you've alienated multiple collaborators on the Debian end with your behavior. That's a fact, not a subjective topic to have an academic discussion about. Posted Aug 31, 2025 13:03 UTC (Sun) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] I believe in talking things out with the goal of understanding each other's perspectives and concerns, and mending actual working relationships. I still haven't seen the Debian people giving adequate (or any) concern to reliability, QA, upstreaming of changes, etc. and I find this concerning. Posted Aug 31, 2025 3:34 UTC (Sun) by jmalcolm (subscriber, #8876) [Link] (3 responses) I have been critical of Kent so let me defend him here. My understanding of the issue with bcachefs-tools in Debian was that bcachefs required a newer version of Rust than Debian wanted. This is a technical issue and being uncompromising on a technical issue is completely different than a philosophical or process issue. Also, bcachefs is hardly the only project that has had dependency issues with Debian. For all its benefits, Debian is poorly suited to new and evolving technologies (in my view at least). Look at Wayland in Debian vs other distros for another example. Even Debian 13 ships with NVIDIA drivers that lack explicit sync which means Wayland will still not work for many people despite working well in other distros for some time already. I am on Kent's side here. &amp;gt; Debian was not even close to the topic at hand, and yet you felt the need to bring it up Posted Aug 31, 2025 3:41 UTC (Sun) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (2 responses) Well, if I didn't bring it up someone else always does in these discussions.

In this case, the userspace helper has far fewer disadvantages I know of. My dream would be for bcachefs to have SQLite’s level of testing and input validation, or (even better) formal verification. Either would massively reduce the rate of bugs making it into a release, but neither is reasonable to ask for outside of a suitably-priced commercial engagement. Posted Aug 30, 2025 22:24 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] The way I use assertions does heavily mimic what you'd do with dependent types, though. My primary approach to reliability is instead to mainly focus on debugability: you can't debug what you can't see, but if you can see everything the system is doing, at runtime, in production, debugging is easy. Also note that filesystems are in a different boat from SQLite, because we have to be able to recover from arbitrary outside damage. If your repair is bulletproof, that makes everything else easier: most bugs are not things you have to lose sleep over.

Posted Aug 31, 2025 13:03 UTC (Sun) by callegar (guest, #16148) [Link] Do you mean in disagreement with the original author? That would ultimately be a fork of bcachefs. Some might define it a hostile fork. While formally doable, seems a bit of a disproportionate punishment for a disagreement. Done on a codebase that is now close to being stable but not just there, seems also to involve a significant deal of piggybacking. &amp;gt; bcachefs is not in the same boat as ZFS. There are no licensing issues. Indeed. Not for the current codebase. But cannot be 100% excluded that in case of a fork patches entering the fork side that has copyright get another license, particularly if one of the sides ends up depending on a sponsor. Having such a fork does not seem healthy and 100% free of risks of fragmenting the code in a ultimately not reconcilable way.

Minimal result: Users can continue to use bcachefs with newer kernels without having to patch the kernel, they just won't get bug fixes, but there will be no functional regression&lt;lb/&gt; 2. Improvement with some effort by users: Users willing to patch the kernel can still apply any patches provided by Kent&lt;lb/&gt; 3. Optimal result: A unicorn with the ability to work with Linus and Kent at the same time may appear, resulting in fixes from Kent being merged with the timing and criteria wanted by Linus&lt;head&gt;Not so bad&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Winning the battles, losing the war&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Winning the battles, losing the war&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Mediation?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Mediation?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Are Linus' patches posted to the mailing lists?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head&gt;Debian Distros&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; There has been comments regarding bcachefs-tools and Debian.&lt;lb/&gt; I think an associated comment might be the difficulty for people external to the distro packagers to provide their own application that works on all the Distros. Not one version of my application for Distro version 10, and another version of my application for Distro verson 11. I should be able to provide one version of my application and it just work on all versions of the Distro, rather than different versions being needed for each Distro version.&lt;lb/&gt; It might be argued that they should have one for .deb and one for .rpm packaging systems, but even though there is a library dependency nightmare and the Debian rules have still not fixed the to address the very valid points Linus Torvalds made in the youtube clip below about "The Year of the Desktop". Note. He made the comment over 10 years ago, and nothing has improved.&lt;lb/&gt; I think it is very well explained in this youtube video: 05:19 to 11:34&lt;lb/&gt; https://youtu.be/5PmHRSeA2c8?t=319&lt;lb/&gt; E.g. Take a very long standing application like cyrus-imapd.&lt;lb/&gt; Through the various Debian releases, one cannot upgrade from one debian release to another because the data structures used by cyrus-imapd change through versions. So the upgrade instructions for cyrus-imapd are simple. You cannot make big jumps in versions of cyrus-imapd. You need to go via intermediate versions for the data structures to be automatically adjusted.&lt;lb/&gt; BUT, Debian distros do not include all those required intermediate versions of cyrus-imapd, so one cannot upgrade Debian withouth breaking cyrus-imapd installations.&lt;lb/&gt; If Debian would allow for more different versions of a lib and applications to be installed at the same time, then that problem would disappear. &lt;head&gt;Not the best outcome&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications using AI embed the AI model in a framework that interfaces between the model and the rest of the system, providing needed services such as tool calling, context retrieval, etc. Software for early chatbots took user input, called the LLM, and returned the result to the user; essentially just a read-eval-print loop. But, as the capabilities of LLMs have evolved and extension mechanisms, such as MCP were defined, the complexities of the control software that calls the LLM have increased. AI software systems require the same qualities that an operating system provides, including security, isolation, extensibility, and portability. For example, when an AI model needs to be given a file as part of its context, access control must be established that determines if the model should be allowed to view that file. We believe it is time to consider standardizing the ways in which the AI models are embedded into software and think of that control software layer as a virtual machine, where one of the machine instructions, albeit a super-powerful one, is to call the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach decouples model development from integration logic, allowing any model to “plug in” to a rich software ecosystem that includes tools, security controls, memory abstractions, etc. Similar to the impact that the Java Virtual Machine had, creating a specification of a VM for the AI orchestrator could enable a “write once, run anywhere” execution environment for AI models while at the same time providing familiar constraints and governance to maintain security and privacy in existing software systems. Below we outline related work in this direction, the motivation behind it, and the key benefits of an AI Model VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI models are being leveraged in existing software as application copilots, embedded in IDEs, and with the rise of the MCP protocol, are increasingly able to use tools, implement agents, etc. This rapid evolution of valuable use cases brings with it a greater need to ensure that the AI-powered applications maintain privacy, are secure, and operate correctly. Guarantees of security and privacy are best provided if the underlying system is secure by design and not added on to systems as an afterthought. We take the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as our inspiration in making the case for the importance of a standard AI Virtual Machine. The Java Virtual Machine guarantees memory safety by design, defines access control policies, and prevents code injection with bytecode verification. These properties allow Java programs running on the JVM to be executed with trust despite being shipped remotely, enabling “write once, run anywhere” software distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the JVM relate to applications that use AI models? We used the following example to explain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diagram illustrates the role of the software layer that interacts with an AI model, which we call the Model Virtual Machine (MVM). That layer intermediates between the model and the rest of the world. For example, a chatbot user might type a prompt (1) that the MVM then sends unmodified to the AI model (2). In practice, the MVM will add additional context, including the system prompt, chat history, to the AI model input as well. The AI model generates a response, which in the example requires a specific tool to be called (3). This response has a specific format that is mutually agreed upon between the model and the MVM, such as MCP. In our example, because it is important to restrict the model from making undesired tool calls, the MVM first consults the list of allowed tools (4) before deciding to call the tool the model requested (5). This check (4) guarantees that the model doesn’t make unauthorized tool calls. Every commercial system using AI models requires some version of this control software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We make the analogy that the interface with the LLM should be a virtual machine. If that is the case, what are the instructions that the machine can execute? Here are examples of operations that existing AI model interfaces have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certifying, loading, initializing, and unloading a given AI model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calling a model with context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parsing the output from the model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Certifying, loading, initializing, and unloading tools&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calling a tool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parsing the results from a tool call&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storing the results from a tool call into memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Asking the user for input&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding content to a history memory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Standard control constructs such as conditionals, sequencing, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A VM would support all of these operations in a well-typed context where constraints are placed on the calls made, the arguments passed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing Work Informs What is Needed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the required elements of a well-specified interface are emerging in AI systems explored in academic work and in applications that are widely deployed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenAI’s Structured Tool Calling Protocols: OpenAI introduced a JSON-based function calling API that lets models invoke code-defined functions in a structured way. This approach, along with OpenAI’s plugin system (which uses OpenAPI specifications for tools), showed how structured tool-calling protocols can reduce ambiguity and simplify integration.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP, 2024): MCP is an open protocol for connecting AI assistants to external data and tools, explicitly aiming to be a universal interface. “Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications,” Anthropic explains. Instead of every service having a custom AI integration, MCP provides a common schema and client-server approach. Despite being relatively new, MCP adoption, including in large companies, has been rapid.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Secure Orchestrators – FIDES &amp;amp; AC4A (2025): Security remains a weak point in current AI systems. Two recent projects propose runtime-level controls. FIDES (by Microsoft Research) enforces information-flow policies on agents by tracking data confidentiality labels and adding new agent actions like “inspect” to limit what agents can access (where a quarantined LLM can safely summarize restricted data) (paper). AC4A (Access Control for Agents) (manuscript in preparation) takes an OS-style approach: All tools and data are organized into hierarchies (like files and folders), and the agent must request read/write access for each resource. AC4A’s runtime intercepts every agent action and blocks anything not permitted, forcing a least-privilege operation mode. These projects show how a standard AI VM could include built-in security and access control, just as modern operating systems do. Even with strong access controls built into a VM specification, AI models present new security challenges that need to be considered in the design. For example, an AI model, when prevented from accessing a particular item of data, might use its chain-of-thought reasoning to devise ways to gather accessible data that allows it to infer the inaccessible item. As such, security researchers have to devise new mitigations to prevent AI models taking adversarial actions even with the virtual machine constraints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open-Source Agent Runtimes: Several projects are actively building general-purpose runtimes for AI. For example, langchain and Semantic Kernel provide numerous common runtime services that make writing reliable AI-enabled applications easier. The AI Controller Interface (AICI) (later renamed llguidance), integrates a lightweight VM into the model-serving pipeline, allowing developers to script and constrain model behavior at a low level (e.g., control of generations token-by-token).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining a specification for a VM interface for AI systems from these emerging approaches will require more than an agreement on protocols and APIs. Because AI systems derive their behavior from training data, model training data must reflect the specification of the VM interface so that the models and the VM model interface can co-evolve. This will enable otherwise diverse models to exhibit broadly compatible behavior with respect to the VM interface specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benefits of a Well-Specified AI Model VM&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, many applications that leverage AI models require reliability, privacy, and security. In addition, new models are developed almost daily and updating the model being used by an application is often necessary. Given this confluence of factors, creating robust AI software presents significant engineering challenges. We believe that a specification of the interface between the AI model and the surrounding software that interfaces to it will address some of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The need for an AI Model VM specification is driven by several clear motivations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Separation of Concerns: An interface specification enforces a clean separation between model logic and integration logic. This means models become interchangeable components. You could swap in a new model (or move an agent to a different platform) and, as long as both adhere to the standard, everything still works. Likewise, virtual machine implementors can increase the performance, security, and tooling of the virtual machine while maintaining compatibility with the AI model interfaces.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Built-in Safety and Governance: A VM specification can enforce safety by design. By routing all tool usage and external access through a well-defined interface, it becomes easier to apply permission checks, audit logs, and fail-safes. As shown by projects like AC4A, the VM can act as a gatekeeper, restricting what models can do unless explicitly authorized. This creates a safer deployment solution for powerful AI systems: even if the model behaves unpredictably, the VM layer can contain its effects. Standards bodies could even define security requirements (e.g., certain calls must always require user confirmation), creating a shared foundation of trust. Similar to the benefits of signed assemblies in the Common Language Runtime, have a certification process around loading and unloading models and tools ensures the end-to-end security of the supply chain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transparent Performance &amp;amp; Resource Tracking: A VM specification could also give developers visibility to runtime diagnostics. Post-execution manifests could report model performance, resource consumption, and data access level which helps developers evaluate overall efficiency and performance. Benchmarks for accuracy, utility, and responsiveness can be supported directly in the VM interface across models and platforms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verifiability of Model Output: Leveraging a VM specification, experts can explore integrating formal methods to verify their model behavior. Techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs could confirm the integrity of model outputs without sensitive internal logic. While still emerging, this possibility hints at new levels of trust and accountability in AI systems and should be carefully considered during development.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We argue that a well-specified AI Model Virtual Machine is needed. Developments occurring in multiple directions, including work from tech companies, startups, and academia, all motivate the need for a VM specification that lets AI models safely and seamlessly interact with the world around them. The motivation is clear – reducing complexity and unlocking interoperability – and the potential benefits range from technical (faster development, modular upgrades) to strategic (cross-platform AI ecosystems, improved safety). From enforcing controls for security and privacy, to potentially formal proof capabilities for trust, the opportunities are wide-ranging. Learning a lesson from older generations of software virtualization, a VM specification can increase AI systems portability, interoperability, security, and reliability. The purpose of this document is to highlight these issues and start engaging with the community on building a consensus that such a specification is needed and what it should include.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You Have to Feel It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You see a series of checkboxes checked. Schedules met. Requirements satisfied. Demos delivered. It's a good day. Good job, you, good job! A promotion is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you didn't feel it. You didn't feel it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We, as people, feel something with every interaction. Frustration, joy, relief, confidence. A feeling. A person interacts with our work. Our work evokes a feeling. The feeling matters. The feeling is part of the work. The desired feeling is part of the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you feel it, you know. The feature makes you smile when you use it. It fits right in, like it was always meant to be there. You want to use it again. You want to tell people about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the difference. This is what metrics, specifications, and demos miss. They don't capture the feeling. For the people who will use and live in the work, the feeling is part of their daily experience. Which means you can't stop at checking the boxes on paper. You have to sit with it, use it, live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This page measures the concentration of user data on the Fediverse and the Atmosphere according to the HerfindahlâHirschman Index (HHI) and the Shannon Index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HHI is an indicator from economics used to measure competition between firms in an industry. Mathematically, HHI is the sum of the squares of market shares of all servers. Values close to zero indicate perfectly competitive markets (eg. many servers, with users spread evenly), while values close to 10000 indicate highly concentrated monopolies (eg. most users on a single server). In economics, values below 100 are considered "Highly Competitive", below 1500 is "Unconcentrated", and above 2500 is considered "Highly Concentrated".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shannon Index is an entropy-based measure used in ecological studies. It is computed the same as Shannon entropy using the natural log: the negative sum over all servers of the "market share" times the log of the market share. Lower values indicate lower entropy (a high concentration of one species), while higher values indicate a more even population. In this context, the maximum value is the number of servers, which would mean that all servers have equal population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This site currently measures the concentration of user data for active users: in the Fediverse, this data is on servers (also known as instances); in the Atmosphere, it is on the PDSes that host users' data repos. All PDSes run by the company Bluesky Social PBC are aggregated in this dataset, since they are under the control of a single entity. Similarly, mastodon.social and mastodon.online are combined as they are run by the same company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The location of user data is not the only interesting measure of centralization. On a technical level, there is the network structure (peer to peer, relays, etc.), identity management, the infrastructure on which it is hosted, etc. On a legal level, there are issues regarding the jurisdictions where servers are located, companies are located, etc. On a social level, there are issues around where human power is concentrated in and on the platform, and whether that power is disproportionately held by certain groups. If you would like to help contribute other measures of decentralization, get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code and data are available on GitHub. Comments and pull requests, including other metrics for measuring distribution and resiliency, are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is the inevitable fate of any convention, but literary history does not, it turns out, have many examples of people appreciating great chaptering. In The History of English Prose Rhythm (1912) – one of the sources for James Joyce’s virtuosic-or-unreadable parodies of the evolution of English prose in Ulysses – George Saintsbury remarks on Thomas Malory’s decision to insert a chapter break at a decisive moment in his fifteenth-century Morte d’Arthur. At the end of chapter ten of the Morte, Lancelot rides into a castle, having slayed its gatekeeper, only to hear from the castle’s residents ‘in doors and windows that said “Fair Knight: thou art unhappy.”’ Saintsbury praises Malory’s sense of timing here. The chapter break introduces a pause, leaving those words, as Dames puts it, ‘hovering in the air’. The next chapter begins with Lancelot successfully freeing captives from the prison; as such, the chapter has served to elongate the narrative incident and heighten the tension.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The only problem is that this was not Malory’s division, but rather one added by the printer William Caxton (c.1422-92). This fact was only discovered in 1934 when an edition of the Morte predating Caxton was discovered at Winchester College. As it turns out, the Winchester version had no chapters. The modulations of time are the work of Caxton’s specific ‘remediation’. He creates an ‘artful segmentation, a resonant silence, in the printed volume’s visual patterning’. Caxton is paired in this chapter of The Chapter with the anonymous fifteenth-century remediators who transformed Chrétien de Troyes’s great twelfth-century Arthurian verse into prose. Unlike Caxton’s their results are not acclaimed; like the authors of movie novelisations today, they are vulgarisers, profaning the sacred bonds between form and content. In their hands, Chrétien’s flowing verse – praised in Mimesis by Auerbach as ‘light and almost easy’ – is not only segmented with red ink, but also crowded with insistent explanations in the register of narrative history (‘How the king kissed Enide’). Again, in the manner of movie novelisers, moments of introspection are reduced while battle sequences are dilated with a vigour that may equally be judged ‘clumsy technique’ or ‘daring maneuver’. More charitably, we might say these remediators practise what Dames calls, after Roman Jakobson, ‘intralingual translation’ – a phrase that calls back to mind (there it is again!) Davis’ experiment with Sterne. Like Davis, the remediators are working across an historical gap between time-feelings, transforming the internal temporality of Chrétien’s verse to fit their own prosaic times. Dames speculates on the reasons for this transformation. Could it be that the new and uncertain ruling clique in Burgundy – ‘freshly arrived at what would be its historical apex’ – preferred these ‘modes of intense now-time’ to the subtle continuities of Chrétien’s verse? Admitting the possibility of such an ‘ideological effect’, Dames also notes that it is equally likely that these ‘new temporalities’ were simply an ‘accident’. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here one notices a difference between Dames’ previous books and The Chapter, whose broader subject matter perhaps helped it to become a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. As brilliant works of literary history, Amnesiac Selves and The Physiology of the Novel both have the density of specialist knowledge and the sensitivity of immersive textual studies. Each book reconstructs a forgotten discourse: the first book reassembles the understanding of memory in the Victorian period, as explored through close readings of key Victorian novelists and scientific writers; the second builds on this interest by turning to the forgotten paradigm of ‘physiological’ novel theory and its exemplars, the philosopher-scientist-critics GH Lewes, ES Dallas, and Alexander Bain, who explored the embodied rhythms of reading. The physiological basis for a literary theory of form was ultimately swept away by more abstract formalisms espoused, on the one hand, by Henry James and his acolyte Percy Lubbock, and, on the other, by the practico-critical poetics of IA Richards (who effectively banished the novel from the classroom). Though Dames’ close readings in The Chapter are no less attentive and sinuous than in these earlier books, they are perforce more limited by the widened scope. I don’t intend to downplay the brilliance of Dames as a reader of individual texts or as a literary historian. However, as the study twists and turns, the density of historical detail together with the vast scope can at times induce a kind of mental torsion, with the dual impulses to historicise and taxonomise pulling in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In any case, the taxonomic conclusion Dames draws from the Burgundian remediators of Chrétien is that while their clumsy cuts are just that – cuts in a continuous weave – Caxton’s interventions are more like the ‘fade’, offering ‘aeration’ to the narrative text. In this respect Caxton’s edits are oriented not towards reference, but ‘narrative progression and rhythm’. The paradoxical outcome of this intervention is to unify Malory’s text precisely by dividing it; the Morte now comprises ‘semi-discrete moments in a single process, rather than entirely different moments’. Unification-through-division of this sort highlights two logics of narrative time: discontinuous and immersive reading. Chaptering itself comes to generate a ‘feeling of presentness’ by adding white space, a species of visual fermata between narrative actions – ‘emptiness [with] a temporal intensity.’&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In their evocation of ‘presentness’, blank intensities of this kind recall a much longer-running theological dispute – between Augustine and the great English theologian Bede – on the divisibility of time. Where, after all, is the present? For Augustine, it is impossible to isolate something like ‘presentness’, for it is composed – as he put it in the Confessions – of ‘fugitive moments’, suspended in the future or always being sucked away into the past. The present is thus not measurable by a distinctive unit. Bede, in his eighth-century work The Reckoning of Time, argued to the contrary that there is a ‘minimal’ or ‘atomic’ unit of time. He made his case through a thought experiment. Say you are just about to be punched in the face. As a reflex, you flinch and close your eyes. Between these two moments – that ‘tiniest interval of time in which the lids of our eyes move when a blow is launched’ – is where ‘Bede’s present’ may be found: the atomic unit of presentness. Dames’ point is not that this theological argument directly influenced Caxton and the Burgundian prosateurs, but rather that the disagreement between the two great theologians reflects different investments in literary forms and their relationships to subjectivity in time. For Augustine a poem ‘held entire’ in the mind of a reciter approximates divine omniscience; for Bede, meanwhile, the atomic present is best accessed via a ‘punctuated continuity and directionality’ that might just be the hallmark of well-divided prose – consequently it is ‘seriality, not the transcendence of seriality, [that] is our access to the divine’. It is only in interrupting the present that we are able to perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But it is left to the early novel (as an historian of the form, Dames is candid about this bias) to develop fully the space between Augustine’s durationless void and Bede’s serial present. Leaping forward another two hundred-odd years, then, Dames shows this binary of discontinuous and immersive reading exploding into an array of conceptual possibilities. ‘The eighteenth-century synthesis’, as Dames calls it, spans the period from the picaresque to the first flourishing of the English novel in the middle of the eighteenth century, with the antics of Sterne and Henry Fielding. Functions inherited from older reference-based chapters are here experimentally set in tension with the narrative innovations first explored in the fifteenth-century remediations: the eighteenth-century chapter struggles with the relationship between the strange and the commonplace, the ‘striking and singular’ and the ‘categorizable’. Hence the initial distinction between discontinuous and immersive reading turns out to contain other oppositions that structure it in turn: between space and time; and between the time narrated and the time it takes to narrate or read.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Figuring all this is that moment on the staircase from the middle of Tristram Shandy, a kind of novelistic freezeframe, in which Sterne fixes Walter Shandy in place to reflect upon chaptering. In Dames’ account, this metachapter makes explicit the chapter’s full conceptual field: it has a direct address; it narrates both an incident and an interruption. What stands out as the real ‘heart’ of the metachapter is the staircase itself, which serves as a kind of symbolic definition of the chapter’s function. The staircase ‘captures the chapter’s double chronometry, that tension expressed by the simultaneous binaries of space versus time and narrated versus narrating times’. Fielding famously compared his chapters to inns along the road of a long journey, where the reader may ‘stop and take a glass’, but Dames thinks the staircase a better figure. Fielding’s coach trip is merely ‘linear, starting and stopping’; Sterne’s staircase, on the other hand, ‘unpacks two complementary but opposed dimensions’. Walter and Toby head down the stairs, troping narrative progress, while at the same time the sequence of steps and landings displays the segmentation of linearity ‘into discrete stages’. Sterne’s novel is a kind of ‘funhouse mirror’ of temporality: instead of proceeding steadily along a horizontal axis, our temporal schema is thrown down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Later, in what JGA Pocock once called the ‘second eighteenth century’, the so-called Age of Revolutions, the chapter mutates again. Now ‘elongated’, the chapter is studied in two works that each seem in different ways to dissolve its earlier functions. In The Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano (1789), the famous autobiography of a Nigerian slave who eventually regained his freedom and lived in Britain, Dames observes a mismatch between the protocols of chaptering and the life that these protocols divide up. Equiano’s chapters offer extensive summaries in the manner of a picaresque novel, but seem at the same time to show the inefficacy of that paratextual structure for capturing the experience of domination and eventual manumission. ‘How then to describe the chapter in Equiano, or more bluntly, why bother to do so?’ It is perhaps relevant precisely because the apparent orderliness of chaptering – its ability meaningfully to sculpt time – is shown, against the absolute alienation of slavery, to be unfit for its usual purpose of segmentation. Thus, the intensively expository chapter summaries of the Narrative not only fail to coordinate with the abbreviated summaries in the table of contents, but they also introduce chapters of far greater length (on average, Dames tells us, these are 6,500 words: up to four times longer than is typical for this period). So, then, what is the meaning of this technical decision? ‘To say,’ Dames writes, coming perilously close to ventriloquising Equiano, ‘a life cannot be measured this way, not this kind of life.’&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As the self-testimony of a former slave, published in the same year as the storming of the Bastille, Equiano’s Narrative is certainly a sign of the times. It is perhaps as iconic a testament to the ‘new epoch’ of the nineteenth century as Girodet’s portrait of Jean-Baptiste Belley, a former slave from Saint-Domingue who would eventually be elected to the French National Convention. ‘New epoch’: this is the legendary, and perhaps apocryphal, phrase of Goethe, uttered in response to the defeat of the Prussians at Valmy in 1792. ‘From this place and from this day a new epoch in world history begins and you can say you were there to see it.’ We might observe that he, for one, did not reach here for the metaphor of the chapter – too ‘partial, fleeting, unhistorical’, according to Dames, to register this period’s epochal shifts. In Goethe’s Wilhem Meister’s Apprenticeship (1795-96), for instance, the chapter becomes even more elongated (one of them is 20,000 words!), doubling in size in the novel’s second half, which was composed after Valmy. Wilhem Meister’s Apprenticeship is a ‘triple turning point’, tying together ‘a world-historical transition, a maturational transition’, and a ‘career transition’ as Goethe, now older and on the other side of the revolution, has to produce fresh material rather than merely revising old writing. It is the very incongruity and ‘dilation’ of the chapter that ‘itself is historical’. Jane Austen’s career is also adduced as an example of the eighteenth century’s passing into the nineteenth, with the three youthful novels drafted in the 1790s averaging chapter lengths of around 2,000 words, while the ‘mature’ novels of the 1810s are nearer 3,500.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However sceptical we might like to be about periodisation, and nasty but inevitable grand narratives, it’s observable that history has, well, happened; historical experience makes ‘norms’ normal, and it is potentially why – to return to Davis’ question with which I began – more people still read Austen for pleasure than Smollett, Fielding, Defoe, or, um, John Bunyan. Not unrelatedly, I recently invited some students to read paragraphs from the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries (respectively, Margery Kempe, Edmund Spenser, Margaret Cavendish, Eliza Haywood, and Sterne: I welcome criticisms of my selections) and one of them said, in so many words, ‘Perhaps some things are forgotten for a reason.’ Perhaps. But we might also wonder: to what extent do novels instruct their readers in how to think, feel, and act? &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This has been one of the questions that Dames has posed most insistently across his career, with a special emphasis on the contributions of the Victorian novel to readerly subjectivity. At the end of Amnesiac Selves, he speculates on the way that Victorian fiction inculcates a special kind of nostalgia – its warm selective memory is the flipside of the alienating nausea of the historical difference that makes you want to throw a book out the window (or, in homage to Sterne, down the stairs). Yet, as Dames noted then, the cultural prestige of Victorian fiction is ‘increasingly seen in an elegiac manner, as a strange fact that, as the twenty-first century begins, will not last much longer’. As the nineteenth century disappears further and further from view, ‘the Victorians will eventually, if belatedly, make Victorian fiction stranger and less attractive’. Since the publication of Amnesiac Selves in 2000, the Victorians have only receded further away from us in time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My phone is an ereader now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a Kobo in 2016 after borrowing my mom's old one for a year before that. It probably is responsible for getting me reading again after high school. I used to be an avid reader, the sort of kid who would have to be told to put down the book and go to sleep, and who would then creep slowly to the bookshelf to pick it up again without arousing suspicion after the light had been turned out. I think I slowed my reading for fun as the work load of school increased, and stopped when moving every four months for internships in university. Having something small and portable that I could load books onto changed that and got my momentum going again. I now loosely grade how much I'm thriving by how much I'm reading, as an indirect indicator of how not burnt out I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It fared me quite well, but I had a few issues with it. Library books would randomly not work on it, even if they would show up on, for example, the Libby app on my phone. It also came with a way to sync articles to it via Pocket, but it always required a little too much forethought for me: I had to remember to find and save articles beforehand in order to then read them later. There were some services to do this automatically via RSS but the syncing process itself was just slow enough that I found myself rarely doing it. Also, Mozilla has now killed Pocket as a service. In the middle of writing this, they announced support for Instapaper instead, but it has the same workflow issues for me. My partner reads on her phone, but something about reading on a screen grates on me after a while, and makes it too easy to jump to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I was intrigued when I heard about the Minimal Phone, an Android phone with an epaper display. It wasn't the first epaper Android device I'd seenâI've seen reviews saying the Boox Palma is actually pretty greatâbut it was the idea of this being an actual phone that can take a sim card that really get me interested. What if I could read the news and blogs on what looks like paper while commuting, without having the forethought of downloading or syncing something? I might otherwise spend that time staring into space or looking at nothing on Bluesky. I'd probably rather be reading a bit of a book, or other longer-form writing. So I ordered one as a gift to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured I might be a good fit for this device. I don't really watch videos on my phone. I send messages a bit, but not urgently. Most of the time I'm at or near a full keyboard anyway. I take some photos, but not that many any more. I feel like the photo winds changed for me sometime in university and I now feel weird posting Nice Photos to social media. Who are those for, really? I now send quick photos directly to friends mostly, and they don't have to be print quality or anything. They just have to be visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I went in treating it like an experiment. I still have my Kobo that has its annoyances but works. I still have a fully functional Pixel 8 phone. I don't need this to work. At worst, this could just be an alternate ereader for me. So when it arrived mid-July, I started testing it full-time to see how it'd go, with my normal phone in my bag just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, I actually really like it! I absolutely would not recommend this device to everyoneâI'll get into why laterâbut it's been working pretty well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the Minimal Phone works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This phone is around the same size of my Pixel 8. It's just a tad shorter and just a tad wider. I don't really feel the shortness, but I do feel the wideness a bit, which makes it more comfortable to read on. The bottom third of the height is taken up by a physical keyboard, and the top two thirds are an epaper display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's just Android under there, with a black-and-white epaper display. It comes with a few launchers, and I use one that works like a pretty traditional launcher, but comes with some built in icon choices that look sharp on the display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a side button between the phone's volume keys that you can tap to flash the display to clear ghosting. I don't find myself doing this oftenâghosting is not that badâbut if you press and hold it, it opens the display settings. This is something I do all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the settings screen, you can turn on and off the light on the display and on the keyboard, and also change the display light's colour temperature. I mostly leave those off; I only need those if I'm outside after dark, and the controls are big enough that I can turn them on easily enough in low light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important setting is the refresh rate at the bottom. The slowest setting has the slowest refresh rate, but the highest quality visuals: always showing nice shades of grey, and with less ghosting but more flashing as it updates. The fastest setting (which, to be clear, is still not very fast) has much less flashing, a little more ghosting, and dithers pure black and white rather than showing any shades of grey. The middle setting, "hybrid" mode, is a combination of the two: it uses the faster setting while things are moving onscreen, and then updates to the slower, higher quality render when movement stops. I generally keep the phone in this hybrid mode, except for a few specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keyboard feels pretty good, and it's a comfortable size to type on with two thumbs. I can't really one-handed type on this phone; it's a tad too wide for that, but the width is worth it for easier reading. I really appreciate them including the keyboard here, as the display looks great but is definitely not all that responsive, so typing would be a lot more frustrating without this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The great parts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This thing is so nice to read on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hate reading on screens. Something about dark mode especially messes with my eyes, but even without that, I've never enjoyed reading articles on my phone. Too easy to get distracted, the minor eye strain... This device though, the epaper display looks great. It's not especially high resolution or anything, but I could spend a long time reading on this without issue. I just spent two flights (Toronto to Vancouver and back again) just reading books on this, and I'd do it again. It's really crisp and visible in the sun too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's super easy to queue up library book holds and read them all from the phone. I have had zero issues with that. Being able to add new things on-the-go has also made it really easy to grab another book on the spot once I finish one. I definitely have found myself reading more books this past month and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also now am more likely to read people's blogs on an RSS reader than scroll through social media. I wasn't setting out to fully purge social media or anything, but I certainly feel a little more fulfilled after reading something that someone has clearly put time and effort into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possibly as a consequence of the display technology, I also generally get 2 days of usage out of a charge. Most days I finish with 70% battery remaining, letting me go another day with some buffer room. On some really low usage days, I could maybe even go more, but already this is great. On a high usage day, I'll maybe end with 50%, which is still fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is secondary, by far, but I also feel now that I can fully turn off autocorrect, as this phone has a physical keyboard. Most of the time (with important caveats), I don't make typos. So I no longer have to suffer through autocorrect changing programming terms (which I still type a lot of), changing my capitalization, or doing its own insane capitalization (why would it format "city Hall" with just one capital? Commit to capitals or no capitals, don't do this awkward mix!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As another minor note, the fingerprint reader is actually quite fast. When it remembers my fingerprints, it's super reliable. ("What do you mean, when it remembers?" I'll get into it later, there's a pretty bad bug here. But in regular usage, it really does work well.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else this phone does, it does a little worse than a normal phone, but not so much worse that it's a problem. I assume it would be a lot worse at watching videos but I never really did that much on my old phone anyway. So on the whole, this phone works really well where I want it to, and generally gets out of my way for the usual stuff. I keep using it without really worrying about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The camera, once set up properly, is pretty passable. Well, the selfie camera is in a super awkward spot, but I don't really find myself using it anyway. But other photos look decent enough that I'm not embarrassed to send them to people!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Growing pains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I do really like this thing, and am continuing to use it as my primary device, there are a lot of rough edges. This device is made by, primarily, two people (although they've been adding more developers in the past few weeks), so naturally there will be a lot of rough edges. You have to be willing to accept that if you're going to use this phone. They do make updates, but the pace is slow, and they are definitely bogged down by customer support and shipping/manufacturing logistics, so you need to not bank on fixes happening quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a double-tap-to-wake feature that you can't turn off, and it takes a sec once locked to stop responding to inputs. Consequently, I now put this in my pocket with the display facing out, which is opposite of what I used to do, in order to prevent accidentally disturbing it in my pocket. Doing that, I haven't had issues, but it's an adjustment you have to make for this phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few things you'll probably need to do to the device to make it work well for you. One of them involves the camera. By default, the camera super aggressively denoises its photos, resulting in images that look like they came off of my flip phone from 2008. However, if you use the Open Camera app, switch it to use the Camera 2 API, it then lets you turn off noise reduction in the settings. The resulting images look much crisper, and do have noise, but a tastefulâdare I say aesthetic?âamount of noise. There is no Pixel-style HDR in these photos, but now that that look is everywhere, the resulting photos are... kind of refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The phone also uses something called Duraspeed to aggressively turn off background apps. This works well in general, but it also can stifle some notifications that you do want, and also can affect background audio. I know some people fully turn Duraspeed off, but I've just turned it off for my messaging apps and my music/podcast apps. I've had no notification or background process related issues since doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also found that the backlight was way too bright, and I didn't really want any lights on most of the time anyway. I found that when opening the display settings, it'd turn all the lights back on. But if I save a preset, then it'd stick. You can do that by changing the settings, and then pressing and holding on the wrench icon to save it to your custom preset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the hybrid refresh mode needs things to stop moving in order to lock in on a higher quality render. That means animated ads are somehow even more annoying than they normally are. Thankfully, Firefox for Android lets you install addons, such as uBlock Origin, to deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bugs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most annoying bug is that this phone will occasionally restart and forget your fingerprint, forcing you to enter your PIN. I don't know why this happens. I can go for a few weeks with it working fine, and then it'll just forget. I can still get in with the PIN, so it's not locking me out, but there's really never a good time to re-set up a fingerprint, and typing a PIN on the onscreen display is slow and cumbersome. This is the bug I hope gets fixed the most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another bug has something to do with the screen refresh rate, and something to do with responding to keyboard input. If you're on a slower refresh rate and are typing quickly, sometimes it misses keypresses, and you have to go back and fix things. This is also quite annoying, but doesn't seem to happen on the highest screen refresh rate. As a workaround, when I'm sending messages, I switch to the fastest refresh setting. This one-or-the-other approach isn't great though (I still want photos sent to me in messaging apps to look nice!), so I'd love to see that improved over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also have to use the phone in the lowest refresh rate for Google Maps in order to see the streets on the map. The color scheme is just too low contrast for the high refresh rate's dithering. The hybrid setting doesn't work either: your location on the map is always slightly moving and so it never locks in and renders a higher-quality image. Arguably, this is a problem with Google Maps because they don't have a high contrast mode. Surely that would have accessibility benefits beyond just this weird device!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a software update that the Minimal team has been working on for almost two months that will apparently address the fingerprint forgetting issue, make double-tap-to-wake optional, significantly increase the refresh rate on the fast refresh mode, and let you save per-app refresh rate settings. That'll address some of my problems for sure! But it also hasn't shipped yet. To use this device is an exercise in patience, and being accepting of imperfections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Feature Requests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these are dealbreakers for me, but here's what I'm hoping to see in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I feel like the vibration on the phone is a tad aggressive. Not every vibration is, thoughâFacebook Messenger notifications feel like the right level. I'd love to be able to adjust the cap for vibration intensity!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I would love emoji search in the keyboard. But I also don't use that many different emoji or symbols, and by now the ones I do use are in the recents list, so it's fine. But the one time I need to use a weird one, it'd be nice to have!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I wish the hybrid refresh mode would work well with camera apps. As it is, I think too much of the screen is updating at once, so it flashes a large part of the display every frame, making it really hard to see. If I put the phone in fast mode, there's no flashing, which is great! But then when I take a photo and tap on the thumbnail to see it, I have to switch back to hybrid or slow mode to see a clearer, non-dithered version. This is a little annoying, and I feel could be improved, but then again I'm not really using this to take a lot of photos anyway.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Concluding the experiment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's been more than a month, and despite not everything being perfect, I'm going to continue using this phone. I do occasionally switch to my Pixel 8 though. I use my Pixel 8 for running for its better waterproofing. When I needed to get actual good, postable photos from SIGGRAPH two weeks ago, I just used my Pixel 8. When seeing LCD Soundsystem last weekend, rather than worry about weirdness with the Ticketmaster app, I just took my Pixel 8. But I've used normal boarding passes for airplanes on my MP01, and I regularly go out without a backup phone. I do mostly rely on my partner to do Google Maps navigation since that's a little bit smoother, although in a pinch I can still use it myself (and the Transit app is a little better in hybrid mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, I use the right tool for the job, and this phone doesn't have to be that tool for all jobs. But it turns out I don't need my phone to do all that many jobs, and it's maybe a good thing for it to be doing less of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are enough quirks that I wouldn't automatically recommend this experience. But if you know what you're getting into and have the right expectations, this is a really great little device!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</content><link href="https://www.davepagurek.com/blog/minimal-phone/"/></entry><entry><id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45080051</id><title>Red: A programming language inspired by REBOL</title><updated>2025-08-31T14:35:23.310816+00:00</updated><content>&lt;doc fingerprint="54eba1b9d3e3f86"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red is a programming language strongly inspired by Rebol, but with a broader field of usage thanks to its native-code compiler, from system programming to high-level scripting, while providing modern support for concurrency and multi-core CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red tackles the software building complexity using a DSL-oriented approach (we call them dialects) . The following dialects are built-in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Red/System: a C-level system programming language compiled to native code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parse: a powerful PEG parser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VID: a simple GUI layout creation dialect&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Draw: a vector 2D drawing dialect&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rich-text: a rich-text description dialect&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red has its own complete cross-platform toolchain, featuring an encapper, a native compiler, an interpreter, and a linker, not depending on any third-party library, except for a Rebol2 interpreter, required during the alpha stage. Once 1.0 is reached, Red will be self-hosted. Currently, Red is still at alpha stage and 32-bit only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red's main features are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Human-friendly syntax&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Homoiconic (Red is its own meta-language and own data-format)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Functional, imperative, reactive and symbolic programming&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prototype-based object support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-typing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powerful pattern-matching Macros system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rich set of built-in datatypes (50+)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Both statically and JIT-compiled(*) to native code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-compilation done right&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Produces executables of less than 1MB, with no dependencies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Concurrency and parallelism strong support (actors, parallel collections)(*)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low-level system programming abilities through the built-in Red/System DSL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powerful PEG parser DSL built-in&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fast and compacting Garbage Collector&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instrumentation built-in for the interpreter, lexer and parser.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-platform native GUI system, with a UI layout DSL and a drawing DSL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bridging to the JVM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High-level scripting and REPL GUI and CLI consoles included&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visual Studio Code plugin, with many helpful features&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Highly embeddable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low memory footprint&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-file (~1MB) contains whole toolchain, full standard library and REPL (**)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No install, no setup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fun guaranteed!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(*) Not implemented yet. (**) Temporarily split in two binaries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More information at red-lang.org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download a GUI or CLI console binary suitable for your operating system, rename it at your convenience, then run it from shell or by double-clicking on it (Windows). You should see the following output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    ---== Red 0.6.5 ==--
    Type HELP for starting information.

    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple Hello World would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; print "Hello World!"
    Hello World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are on the GUI console, a GUI Hello World (prompt omitted):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    view [text "Hello World!"]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A more sophisticated example that retrieves the last commits from this repo and displays their log messages in a scrollable list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    view [
        text-list data collect [
            foreach event load https://api.github.com/repos/red/red/commits [
                keep event/commit/message
            ]
        ]
    ]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: check also the following improved version allowing you to click on a given commit log and open the commit page on github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now head to see and try some showcasing scripts here and there. You can run those examples from the console directly using Github's "raw" link. E.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; do https://raw.githubusercontent.com/red/code/master/Showcase/calculator.red
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: If you are using the Wine emulator, it has some issues with the GUI-Console. Install the &lt;code&gt;Consolas&lt;/code&gt; font to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Red toolchain comes as a single executable file that you can download for the big-3 platforms (32-bit only for now). Rename the file to &lt;code&gt;redc&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;redc.exe&lt;/code&gt; under Windows).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Put the downloaded redc binary in the working folder.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a code or text editor, write the following Hello World program:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Red [ Title: "Simple hello world script" ] print "Hello World!"&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Save it under the name: hello.red&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Generate a compiled executable from that program: (first run will pre-compile libRedRT library)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;$ redc -c hello.red $ ./hello&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want to generate a compiled executable from that program with no dependencies?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;$ redc -r hello.red $ ./hello&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Want to cross-compile to another supported platform?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;$ redc -t Windows hello.red $ redc -t Darwin hello.red $ redc -t Linux-ARM hello.red&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full command-line syntax is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;redc [command] [options] [file]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[file]&lt;/code&gt; any Red or Red/System source file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The -c, -r and -u options are mutually exclusive.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note: The toolchain executable (&lt;code&gt;redc.exe&lt;/code&gt;) relies on Rebol encapper which does not support being run from a location specified in &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable and you get &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM ERROR: Invalid encapsulated data&lt;/code&gt; error. If you are on Windows try using PowerShell instead of CMD. You can also provide the full path to the executable, put a copy of it in your working folder or wrap a shell script (see relevant tickets: #543 and #1547).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler and linker are currently written in Rebol. Please follow the instructions for installing the compiler toolchain in order to run it from sources:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clone this git repository or download an archive (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ZIP&lt;/code&gt;button above or from tagged packages).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Download a Rebol interpreter suitable for your OS: Windows, Linux (or Linux), Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extract the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rebol&lt;/code&gt;binary, put it in the root folder, that's all!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's test it: run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;./rebol&lt;/code&gt;, you'll see a&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;prompt appear. Windows users need to double-click on the&lt;code&gt;rebol.exe&lt;/code&gt;file to run it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the REBOL console type:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; do/args %red.r "%tests/hello.red"&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compilation process should finish with a &lt;code&gt;...output file size&lt;/code&gt; message. The resulting binary is in the working folder. Windows users need to open a DOS console and run &lt;code&gt;hello.exe&lt;/code&gt; from there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can compile the Red console from source:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; do/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/CLI/console.red"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To compile the Windows GUI console from source:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; do/args %red.r "-r -t Windows %environment/console/GUI/gui-console.red"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; argument is not necessary when launching the Red toolchain from sources, as the default action is to compile the input script (the toolchain in binary form default action is to run the input script through the interpreter).
The &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; argument is needed when compiling the Red console to make additional runtime functions available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The red git repository does not include a &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file. If you run the automated tests, several files will be created that are not stored in the repository. Installing and renaming a copy of &lt;code&gt;.git/.gitignore-sample&lt;/code&gt; file will ignore these generated files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to contribute code to the Red project be sure to read the guidelines first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is usually a good idea to inform the Red team about what changes you are going to make in order to ensure that someone is not already working on the same thing. You can reach us through our chat room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satisfied with the results of your change and want to issue a pull request on Github?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure the changes pass all the existing tests, add relevant tests to the test-suite, and please test on as many platforms as you can. You can run all the tests using (from Rebol console, at repository root):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    &amp;gt;&amp;gt; do %run-all-tests.r
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want git version included in your Red console built from sources, use this command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;call/show ""                                              ;-- patch call bug on Windows
save %build/git.r do %build/git-version.r                 ;-- lookup git version if available
do/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/CLI/console.red"  ;-- build Console
write %build/git.r "none^/"                               ;-- restore git repo status&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some anti-virus programs are a bit too sensitive and can wrongly report an alert on some binaries generated by Red (see here for the details). If that happens to you, please report it to your anti-virus vendor as a false positive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Red and Red/System are published under BSD license, runtime is under BSL license. BSL is a bit more permissive license than BSD, more suitable for the runtime parts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Open Table of contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A little bit about Go&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like Go. I actually donât mind writing &lt;code&gt;err != nil&lt;/code&gt; that much. Just set up a snippet and youâre good to Go. Although, I never really felt like I had a honeymoon period with Go. I learned the language, learned about channels, wrote a bunch of CRUDs and parsers and CLIs. It always felt strictly business. I thought it was because of where I am in my career. But I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go is vanilla. It just werks. You build it, you ship it. The language is simple and you donât need to try hard to make it performant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But sometimes you just want a little spiceð¶ï¸ð¥µ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you ever wonder what else is out there? Hobby programming is a great meme. But I feel like weâre under too much pressure to produce the new unicorn SaaS with 10 million monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You donât have to pick a tool then find the right job for it. You can just grab a hammer and start smashing stuff. The same nails youâve smashed before might feel different if you smash it with another hammer. Pick a Rusty hammer and you might end up obsessed with how important health and safety is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;So, wtf is Vlang?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I might have shot myself in the foot with the hammer analogy there, so letâs talk about ice cream. Ok so hereâs the gist: vanilla, drizzle some chocolate on top, peanuts? sure why not. You know this taste, you like it, it comes with more stuff on top. If you like vanilla then you might like vanilla++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That how I see the current state of V. The syntax is similar to Go. It has extra features. The core of it is similar, you can cross compile, you have concurrency (which is also parallelism). Channels and message passing. Oh and &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; as well. All my bros love using &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, letâs see some cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Maps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// So simple!
simple_languages := {"elixir": {"score": 100, "width": 30}}

// Alternatively
mut languages := map[string]map[string]int{"elixir": {"score": 100, "width": 30}}
languages["elixir"] = {"score": 100}
languages["elixir"]["width"] = 30&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty cool! Much like Go, the maps require a fixed type, dynamic objects like JSON or JavaScript requires either a DTO or a type switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, but what about the error handling?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;elixir_score := languages["elixir"]["score"] or { -1 }

if racket := languages['racket'] {
  println('racket score ${racket['score']}')
  racket_width := racket['width'] or { 0 }
  println('racket width ${racket_width}')
}

// Another way to skin the cat
if 'haskell' in languages {
  if 'score' !in languages['haskell'] {
    println('where is my haskell score??')
  }
}

// Zeroth value
languages['this_dont_exist'] // {}
languages['this_dont_exist']['score'] // 0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Donât you miss destructuring?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;languages_with_racket_ocaml := {
  ...languages
  'racket': {'score': 99}
  'ocaml': {'score': 98}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Struct-licious&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module main

struct Language {
pub mut:
	score int = -1
	name  string @[required]
}

fn (lr []Language) total() int {
	mut total := 0
	for l in lr {
      if l.score &amp;gt; 0 {
        total += l.score
      }
	}

	return total
}

fn (lr []Language) average() int {
	return lr.total() / lr.len
}

fn main() {
	racket := Language{98, 'racket'}
    // Simple arrays too!
	langs_arr := [racket, Language{102, 'ocaml'}]
	println(langs_arr)
	println(langs_arr.total())
	println(langs_arr.average())
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isnât that cool? We can have receiver methods on array types. Wait - did you see that? We had a required tag on the struct, that means the program wonât compile if you donât initialise it. Thatâs another cool thing I wish Go has. Not to mention, the initialiser value, Goâs struct is quite predictable in how the value turns out. However, Vâs struct allows you to be explicit. This came in very handy for my case!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@[xdoc: 'Server for GitHub language statistics']
@[name: 'v-gh-stats']
struct Config {
mut:
	show_help bool   @[long: help; short: h; xdoc: 'Show this help message']
	user      string = os.getenv('GH_USER')           @[long: user; short: u; xdoc: 'GitHub username env \$GH_USER']
	token     string = os.getenv('GH_TOKEN')          @[long: token; short: t; xdoc: 'GitHub personal access token env \$GH_TOKEN']
	debug     bool   = os.getenv('DEBUG') == 'true'   @[long: debug; short: d; xdoc: 'Enable debug mode env \$DEBUG']
	cache     bool   = os.getenv('CACHE') == 'true'   @[long: cache; short: c; xdoc: 'Enable caching env \$CACHE']
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This example contains flags for running my SVG generation server, it allows you to define the flags yourself but if not, use the environmental value. Neato!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;WithOption pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ahh yes, another thing I had to put up with. TBH, I did end up liking the pattern quite a bit. In Go, no default variables are allowed, you have to use variadics. You end up with an Option struct with zeroth value passing around a few functions to finally one last giant private receiver function that creates the struct, fills the value then finally build and check. Imagine a SQL repository pattern where you want to perform a List operation but optionally join or ensure some field is present in a query. Letâs see how we can cook this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module main

import time

@[params]
struct ListOption {
pub mut:
	created_since time.Time
}

@[params]
struct HeroListOption {
	ListOption
pub mut:
	universe string
	name     ?string
}

struct Hero {}

struct Repo[T] {}

struct Villain {}

fn (r Repo[T]) list(o ListOption) ![]T {
	$if T is Villain {
		return error('whoops you found Villain some how but its not implemented yet')
	}

	return error('whoops not implemented for ${T.name} use one of (Hero, ...)')
}

fn (r Repo[Hero]) list(o HeroListOption) ![]Hero {
	mut query := orm.build_query()

	if o.universe != '' {
		query.eq('universe', o.universe)
	}

	if o.created_since.unix() &amp;gt; 0 {
		query.gt('created_since', o.created_since)
	}

	if name := o.name {
		query.eq('name', name)
	}

	return r.psql(query.do()!)!
}

fn main() {
	r := Repo[Villain]{}
	r.list() or { println(err) }

	hero_repo := Repo[Hero]{}
	hero_repo.list()!
	hero_repo.list(name: 'bruce')!
	hero_repo.list(name: 'bruce', universe: 'dc')!
	hero_repo.list(name: 'bruce', universe: 'marvel')!
	hero_repo.list(created_since: time.Time{year: 1996})!
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs a lot to unpack here. Letâs start with &lt;code&gt;@[params]&lt;/code&gt; which tells the V compiler that the struct as a whole can be omitted entirely so you can write the empty function and it will still works. Secondly, since generics are a compile time thing we can use reflection to check for the name of the type itself. See link below to see what is possible. You can reflect and check for field existence and field types as well as attributes (remember &lt;code&gt;@[required]&lt;/code&gt;?).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, we keep seeing this bang (&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;) everywhere. So what is it? Short answer: Result type. Medium answer: &lt;code&gt;(int, err) -&amp;gt; !int&lt;/code&gt;. You donât need the long answer. The bang can propagate although you must remember to handle this somewhere or it will cause a panic eventually. Finally, the optional type. I purposedly only use it for one of the field to show that it can be done, you can decide how you want to write your optionals. But damn! It feels great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;go-uber/functional-options vlang/trailing-struct-args vlang/compile-time-reflection vlang/optional-and-result-type&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enums??? In this economy?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enums are so back baby. We can totally replace the previous sectionâs &lt;code&gt;universe&lt;/code&gt; field as such.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;enum Universe {
  dc
  marvel
  nil
}

fn (u Universe) str() ?string {
	return match u {
      // V knows the enum there's no need to type Universe.dc
      .dc { 'dc' }
      .marvel { 'marvel' }
      else {''}
	}
}

@[params]
struct HeroListOption {
	ListOption
pub mut:
	universe Universe = .nil
	name     ?string
}

fn (r Repo[Hero]) list(o HeroListOption) ![]Hero {
	...

	if o.universe != .nil {
		query.eq('universe', o.universe.str())
	}

	...
}

fn main() {
	hero_repo := Repo[Hero]{}
	hero_repo.list(name: 'bruce', universe: .dc)!

	// functions not expecting enum requires the full path
	// auto str() conversion here - see Go fmt.Stringer() or your __str__, __toString()
	println('${Universe.dc}')
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optional type might be better here. Iâm okay with this though. There is backed enum as well but you can only have integer backed enums. Did you also notice? Receiver method on the backed enum baby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lambda; the best kind of lamb&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The array stucts have a set of methods you can use like the basic &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; - there is a stdlib module called &lt;code&gt;arrays&lt;/code&gt; as well that you need to import. It provides more complex methods like &lt;code&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt; and the likes. I donât know about you but I am chuffed this exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import math

fn example() {
	// type hinting here to skip typing Universe.*
	mut universes := []Universe{}
	universes = [.dc, .marvel, .nil, .dc]
	dcs_or_marvel := universes.filter(it != .nil)
	nils := universes.filter(|u| u == .nil)

	// sorting in place
	[5, 2, 1, 3, 4].sort(a &amp;lt; b)
	sorted := [5, 2, 1, 3, 4].sorted(a &amp;lt; b)
}

struct XY {
	x int
	y int
}

fn (xy XY) dist_from_origin() f64 {
	return math.sqrt((xy.x * xy.x) + (xy.y * xy.y))
}

fn example2() {
	xys := [XY{1, 2}, XY{10, 20}, XY{-1, -69}]
	xys.sort(a.dist_from_origin() &amp;lt; b.dist_from_origin())
	y_asc := xys.sorted(a.y &amp;lt; b.y)
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs a few caveats here. You gotta make sure the function youâre using actually allow for &lt;code&gt;it&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt; b&lt;/code&gt; expression, but lambda expression will work anywhere a function is accepted as an argument. However, you canât use lambda as a variable like &lt;code&gt;x_asc := |a, b| a.x &amp;lt; b.x&lt;/code&gt;. Still, neat. Use the LSP to check what is accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Some issues Iâve encountered&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As fun as it has been learning the language and building an svg service - it is not without problems. The language is on the immature side of things. It has had some time to cook since I last tried it in 2023 and I like it even more. Letâs discuss some of the problems Iâve personally encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;net.http&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was trying to call the GraphQL endpoint using the &lt;code&gt;net.http&lt;/code&gt; module, I ran into issue where it would instantly timeout. This network issue described what is happening in my case precisely, adding the flag &lt;code&gt;-d use_openssl&lt;/code&gt; completely fixed my problem. This seems to be the case when building for Ubuntu 22.4 - when building the exe for my Windows 11 I did not need this flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are wondering what the &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag is about, it is a flag for compile-time code branching. See vlang/compiletime-code for more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;veb&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another weird quirk Iâve had when working with the &lt;code&gt;veb&lt;/code&gt; HTTP server is refusing to build when trying to use gzip. Take a look at this build error message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/root/.local/v/vlib/veb/middleware.v:129:11: error: field `Ctx.return_type` is not public
127 |         handler: fn [T](mut ctx T) bool {
128 |             // TODO: compress file in streaming manner, or precompress them?
129 |             if ctx.return_type == .file {
    |                    ~~~~~~~~~~~
130 |                 return true

    &lt;p&gt;What do you think the issue could be? Maybe my version of the language is incorrect or my build was faulty? I purged the local V install and got a fresh version straight from master branch. Yet the issue still persists. Another &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily for me somebody already posted about this issue in GitHub, unluckily for me, I didnât search the error message first (whoops). Well, I canât really tell you what the issue is since I havenât delved into Vâs codebase itself. But I can tell you the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my &lt;code&gt;main.v&lt;/code&gt;, since I was messing around with servers and running main with arguments I needed to import both modules. This was the &lt;code&gt;head -n5&lt;/code&gt; of my errorneous file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module main

import os
import veb&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The suggested fix?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module main

import veb
import os&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow! The code now compiles! From a fresherâs perspective I have no clue why the order of import would affect code in different modules. Namespace should be sacred and completely independent of each other. The order of import should not matter at all. Both packages seems to be unrelated so wtf happened?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More complex build system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had alluded to this earlier, there is a cost to using V over Go. Vâs main backend compiles to C and this comes with complexity. There are a bunch of performance optimisations you can do when building the binary itself. You can even build non-static binaries if you wish (in fact this is the default). This is a double-edged sword, with Go, you get what you got. With V, I got what I got but I wonder if what I got can be gotten differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might also complicate cross-compilation, the Go team has done a lot of work to ensure things werk across different architectures and OSes. Iâve only tried compiling to Windows and Linux using the static flag. Hereâs my build command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;v -prod -compress -d use_openssl -cflags '-static -Os -flto' -o main .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flag would have to be optional here depending on where I am trying to target as well, Iâd probably have to spend time learning whatâs possible for Macs as well. I know those platforms are definitely supported since their GitHub actions page contains the CI pipelines for these, but I would personally need to check if my specific implemntation, order of imports as well as &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; flags need to be there for those systems or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the one big point I have to give to Go. They really have the just werks philosophy down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vlang/ci vlang/performance-optimisation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Concurrency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wondered how the performance of the concurrency is compared to Go. The model is almost identical (which is good) but surely the implementation details are different. Luckily, there is a programming benchmark that exists already that answers my questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I brought up concurrency letâs take a look at the code to see the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;module main

import os
import strconv

fn main() {
	mut n := 100
	if os.args.len &amp;gt; 1 {
		n = strconv.atoi(os.args[1]) or { n }
	}

	mut ch := chan int{cap: 1}
	spawn generate(ch)
	for _ in 0 .. n {
		prime := &amp;lt;-ch
		println(prime)
		ch_next := chan int{cap: 1}
		spawn filter(ch, ch_next, prime)
		ch = ch_next
	}
}

fn generate(ch chan int) {
	mut i := 2
	for {
		ch &amp;lt;- i++
	}
}

fn filter(chin chan int, chout chan int, prime int) {
	for {
		i := &amp;lt;-chin
		if i % prime != 0 {
			chout &amp;lt;- i
		}
	}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;benchmark/sieve.go benchmark/sieve.v&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tldr; itâs finding prime numbers by computing a running channel of previous prime numbers to feed into &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to check if &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is divisible by any previous primes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems weird to me that Vâs version is timing out even though both implementation looks almost identical. So I ran the benchmark on my local machine. Hereâs my &lt;code&gt;justfile&lt;/code&gt; to run the benchmark using all I know so far about optimising V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;default:
    v -prod -gc boehm_full_opt -cc clang -cflags "-march=broadwell" -stats -showcc -no-rsp -o main_v 1.v
    go build -o main_go ./main.go
    hyperfine './main_v 100' './main_go 100' -N&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the result:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Benchmark 1: ./main_v 100
  Time (mean Â± Ï):      32.1 ms Â±   2.9 ms    [User: 42.6 ms, System: 166.4 ms]

  './main_go 100' ran

    &lt;p&gt;This is exacerbated further when we run N=1000&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Benchmark 1: ./main_v 1000
  Time (mean Â± Ï):      1.189 s Â±  0.340 s    [User: 4.410 s, System: 8.144 s]

    &lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the N=100 profiling we can see what happened exactly&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is a ton of calls going to &lt;code&gt;Semaphore_try_wait&lt;/code&gt; with the actual &lt;code&gt;Sempahore_wait&lt;/code&gt; execution itself taking over &lt;code&gt;10_000 ms&lt;/code&gt; in total.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests to me that while the concurrency is there, it exists and work similarly to the end user. Though in the current state, itâs no where near Goâs maturity and optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;&amp;lt;/Thoughts&amp;gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like V a lot. The abstraction over the syntax is so nice that made me enjoy writing the syntax as a whole. It makes me wish that Go could do more with what they have, but you and I know that Go would never. V isnât without itâs problems though, the ecosystem is still quite immature, compiler flags need grokking over even if youâre not a performance maximalist. IMO, the issue comes down to maturity, given enough time and contributor I believe the language will bloom beautifully. The syntax conveniences already had me sold. I know AI can write boilerplate but it feels good to not need it at all and write everything myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V has come a lot further than when I tried it in 2023. Iâll be actively using it from now on since my main job in Go leaves me wishing for more from time to time. If you enjoy Go anyway itâs worth checking out. Life it too short to mainline one language. Oh and check out my SVG service ktunprasert/v-github-stats&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2001, quantum computers factored the number 15. It’s now 2025, and quantum computers haven’t yet factored the number 21. It’s sometimes claimed this is proof there’s been no progress in quantum computers. But there’s actually a much more surprising reason 21 hasn’t been factored yet, which jumps out at you when contrasting the operations used to factor 15 and to factor 21.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The circuit (the series of quantum logic gates) that was run to factor 15 can be seen in Figure 1b of “Experimental realization of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important cost here is the number of entangling gates. This factoring-15 circuit has 6 two-qubit entangling gates (a mix of CNOT and CPHASE gates). It also has 2 Toffoli gates, which each decompose into 6 two-qubit entangling gates. So there’s a total of 21 entangling gates in this circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, for comparison, here is a circuit for factoring 21. Sorry for rotating it, but I couldn’t get it to fit otherwise. Try counting the Toffolis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Here’s an OPENQASM2 version of the circuit, so you can test it produces the right distribution if you’re inclined to do so.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you lost count: this circuit has 191 cnot gates and 369 Toffoli gates, implying a total of 2405 entangling gates. That’s 115x more entangling gates than the factoring-15 circuit. The factoring-21 circuit is more than one hundred times more expensive than the factoring-15 circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I ask people to guess how many times larger the factoring-21 circuit is, compared to the factoring-15 circuit, there’s a tendency for them to assume it’s 25% larger. Or maybe twice as large. The fact that it’s two orders of magnitude more expensive is shocking. So I’ll try to explain why it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Quick aside: the amount of optimization that has gone into this factoring-21 circuit is probably unrepresentative of what would be possible when factoring big numbers. I think a more plausible amount of optimization would produce a circuit with 500x the cost of the factoring-15 circuit… but a 100x overhead is sufficient to make my point. Regardless, special thanks to Noah Shutty for running expensive computer searches to find the conditional-multiplication-by-4-mod-21 subroutine used by this circuit.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where does the 100x come from?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key background fact you need to understand is that the dominant cost of a quantum factoring circuit comes from doing a series of conditional modular multiplications under superposition. To factor an $n$-bit number $N$, Shor’s algorithm will conditionally multiply an accumulator by $m_k = g^{2^k} \pmod{N}$ for each $k &amp;lt; 2n$ (where $g$ is a randomly chosen value coprime to $N$). Sometimes people also worry about the frequency basis measurement at the end of the algorithm, which is crucial to the algorithm’s function, but from a cost perspective it’s irrelevant. (It’s negligible due by an optimization called “qubit recycling”, which I also could have used to reduce the qubit count of the factoring-21 circuit, but in this post I’m just counting gates so meh).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three effects that conspire to make the factoring-15 multiplications substantially cheaper than the factoring-21 multiplications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All but two of the factoring-15 multiplications end up multiplying by 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The first multiplication is always ~free, because its input is known to be 1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The one remaining factoring-15 multiplication can be implemented with only two CSWAPs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider the case where $g=2$. In that case, when factoring 15, the constants to conditionally multiply by would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print([pow(2, 2**k, 15) for k in range(8)])
[2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, notice that the last six constants are 1. Multiplications by 1 can be implemented by doing nothing. So the factoring-15 circuit is only paying for 2 of the expected 8 multiplications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, notice that the first conditional multiplication (by 2) will either leave the accumulator storing 1 (when its control is off) or storing 2 (when its control is on). This can be achieved much more cheaply by performing a controlled xor of $1 \oplus 2 = 3$ into the accumulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, notice that the only remaining multiplication is a multiplication by 4. Because 15 is one less than a power of 2, multiplying by 2 modulo 15 can be implemented using a circular shift. A multiplication by 4 is just two multiplications by 2, so it can also be implemented by a circular shift. This is a very rare property for a modular multiplication to have, and here it reduces what should be an expensive operation into a pair of conditional swaps. (If you go back and look at the factoring-15 circuit at the top of the post, the 2 three-qubit gates are being used to implement these two conditional swaps.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may worry that these savings are specific to the choice of $g=2$ and $N=15$. And they are in fact specific to $N=15$. But they aren’t specific to $g=2$. They occur for all possible choices of $g$ when factoring 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For contrast, let’s now consider what happens when factoring 21. Using $g=2$, the multiplication constants would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  print([pow(2, 2**k, 21) for k in range(10)])
[2, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4, 16, 4]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is going to be a lot more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, there’s no multiplications by 1, so the circuit has to pay for every multiplication instead of only a quarter. That’s a ~4x relative cost blowup vs factoring 15. Second, although the first-one’s-free trick does still apply, proportionally speaking it’s not as good. It cheapens 10% of the multiplications rather than 50%. That’s an extra ~1.8x cost blowup vs factoring 15. Third, the multiplication by 4 and 16 can’t be implemented with two CSWAPs. The best conditionally-multiply-by-4-mod-21 circuit that I know is the one being used in the diagram above, and it uses 41 Toffolis. These more expensive multiplications add a final bonus ~20x cost blowup vs factoring 15.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Aside: multiplication by 16 mod 21 is the inverse of multiplying by 4 mod 21, and the circuits are reversible, so multiplying by 16 uses the same number of Toffolis as multiplying by 4.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These three factors (multiplying-by-one, first-one’s-free, and multiplying-by-swapping) explain the 100x blowup in cost of factoring 21, compared to factoring 15. And this 100x increase in cost explains why no one has factored 21 with a quantum computer yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another contributor to the huge time gap between factoring 15 and factoring 21 is that the 2001 factoring of 15 was done with an NMR quantum computer. These computers were known to have inherent scaling issues, and in fact it’s debated whether NMR computers were even properly “quantum”. If the 2001 NMR experiment doesn’t count, I think the actually-did-the-multiplications runner-up is a 2015 experiment done with an ion trap quantum computer (discussed by Scott Aaronson at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet another contributor is the overhead of quantum error correction. Performing 100x more gates requires 100x lower error, and the most plausible way of achieving that is error corection. Error correction requires redundancy, and could easily add a 100x overhead on qubit count. Accounting for this, I could argue that factoring 21 will be ten thousand times more expensive than factoring 15, rather than “merely” a hundred times more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are papers that claim to have factored 21 with a quantum computer. For example, here’s one from 2021. But, as far as I know, all such experiments are guilty of using optimizations that imply the code generating the circuit had access to information equivalent to knowing the factors (as explained in “Pretending to factor large numbers on a quantum computer” by Smolin et al). Basically: they don’t do the multiplications, because the multiplications are hard, but the multiplications are what make it factoring instead of simpler forms of period finding. So I don’t count them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is unfortunately a trickle of bullshit results that claim to be quantum factoring demonstrations. For example, I have a joke paper in this year’s sigbovik proceedings that cheats in a particularly silly way. More seriously, I enjoyed “Replication of Quantum Factorisation Records with an 8-bit Home Computer, an Abacus, and a Dog” making fun of some recent egregious papers. I also recommend Scott Aaronson’s post “Quantum computing motte-and-baileys”, which complains about papers that benchmark “variational” factoring techniques while ignoring the lack of any reason to expect them to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of the large cost of quantum factoring numbers (that aren’t 15), factoring isn’t yet a good benchmark for tracking the progress of quantum computers. If you want to stay abreast of progress in quantum computing, you should be paying attention to the arrival quantum error correction (such as surface codes getting more reliable as their size is increased) and to architectures solving core scaling challenges (such as lost neutral atoms being continuously replaced).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It appears that it was US military communications doctrine to not send the exact same message twice using different encryption ("none" counting as one type of encryption), and the term of art for changing a message to avoid that was indeed "paraphrase".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I managed to dig up a US Army document on Cryptology from roughly that era that appears to discuss paraphrasing. The document in question is Department of the Army Technical Manual TM 32-220(pdf), dated 1950, titled "BASIC CRYPTOGRAPHY". It apparently supersedes previous documents TM-484 from March 1945 and TM 11-485 from June 1944. It would probably be more ideal to look at them, since they are closer to the time you are interested in, but I was not able to find them online.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's what this declassified manual had to say about "paraphrasing", from Chapter 7, in the section Fundamental Rules of Cryptographic Security, section 84, subsection b, rule 3 (titled "Text of messages")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(a) Never repeat in the clear the identical text of a message once sent in cryptographic form, or repeat in cryptographic form the text of a message once sent in the clear. Anything which will enable an alert enemy to compare a given piece of plain text with a cryptogram that supposedly contains this plain text is highly dangerous to the safety of the cryptographic system. Where information must be given out for publicity, or where information is handled by many persons, the plain text version should be very carefully paraphrased before distribution, to minimize the data an enemy might obtain from an accurate comparison of the cryptographic text with the equivalent, original plain text. To paraphrase a message means to rewrite it so as to change its original wording as much as possible without changing the meaning of the message. This is done by altering the positions of sentences in the message, by altering the positions of subject, predicate, and modifying phrases or clauses in the sentence, and by altering as much as possible the diction by the use of synonyms and synonymous expressions. In this process, deletion rather than expansion of the wording of the message is preferable, because if an ordinary message is paraphrased simply by expanding it along its original lines, an expert can easily reduce the paraphrased message to its lowest terms, and the resultant wording will be practically the original message. It is very important to eliminate repeated words or proper names, if at all possible, by the use of carefully selected pronouns; by the use of the words "former," "latter," "first-mentioned," "second-mentioned"; or by other means. After carefully paraphrasing, the message can be sent in the other key or code.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;(b) Never send the literal plain text or a paraphrased version of the plain text of a message which has been or will be transmitted in cryptographed form except as specifically provided in appropriate regulations&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In fact the allies would have have known intimately about how this was possible, because this is one of the ways they ended up decrypting the stronger German Enigma cipher. Captured machines using simpler ciphers were used to break those simpler ciphers. The fact that the Germans were encrypting the exact same messages in both ciphers meant the allies could know (for those messages) what both the unencrypted and encrypted messages were, which allowed them to decrypt the stronger cyphers as well, or quickly figure out what today's code was.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though Enigma had some cryptographic weaknesses, in practice it was German procedural flaws, operator mistakes, failure to systematically introduce changes in encipherment procedures, and Allied capture of key tables and hardware that, during the war, enabled Allied cryptologists to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The history of computing can be viewed as a steady progression toward more intuitive human-computer interaction. Each new era has broken down barriers, allowing more people to harness computational power without specialized technical knowledge. Artificial Intelligence isnât a radical departure from this trajectory-itâs the natural next step in making computers more accessible and useful to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Early Days: Speaking the Machineâs Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In computingâs infancy, humans had to communicate with machines on their terms. The first programmable computers required inputs in machine language-binary code represented through physical media like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Punch cards: Physical cards with holes representing data and instructions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Paper tape: Similar to punch cards but in continuous form&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Toggle switches: Physical switches flipped to represent binary states&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This era required deep technical expertise. Programming involved understanding the machine at its most fundamental level-its circuits, registers, and memory addresses. The barrier to entry was extraordinarily high, limiting computer use to specialized scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple calculation that todayâs elementary school student could perform with a few keystrokes might have required days of preparation, specialized knowledge, and physical media that took up entire rooms to store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The GUI Revolution: Meeting in the Middle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next major evolution came with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and higher-level programming languages. This shift represented a compromise-humans still needed to provide precise instructions, but computers now met us partway with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Visual metaphors: Desktop, files, folders, and trash bins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WIMP interfaces: Windows, icons, menus, and pointing devices&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Event-driven programming: Code that responds to user actions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This era democratized computing significantly. Business professionals could use spreadsheets without understanding memory allocation. Writers could use word processors without knowing assembly language. Yet despite these advances, computers remained fundamentally passive tools requiring explicit, detailed instructions for every task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with user-friendly interfaces, computers needed humans to break down complex goals into discrete, actionable steps. Want to analyze market trends? You needed to specify exactly how to import the data, which variables to compare, which statistical methods to use, and how to visualize the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The AI Era: Understanding Human Intent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre now entering an era where the fundamental relationship between humans and computers is changing. With AI, computers are beginning to understand and act on human goals rather than just explicit instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Natural language processing: Communicating in human language rather than code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intent recognition: Understanding what users want to accomplish&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Autonomous problem-solving: Breaking down complex tasks without human guidance&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This shift represents the computer taking on more of the cognitive burden of the human-computer relationship. Instead of the human translating their needs into the computerâs language, the computer is learning to interpret human needs directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GUI era: âOpen Photoshop â Create new file â Set dimensions to 1200x628 â Select rectangle tool â Draw rectangle from coordinates (0,0) to (1200,628) â Fill with color #3B5998â¦â&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI era: âCreate a Facebook cover image with our company logo and a modern blue background.â&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The computational task remains similar, but the cognitive work required from the human has drastically changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Democratizing Computation for All&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each phase of computing has expanded the population of people who can effectively leverage computational power:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Machine language era: Limited to specialized engineers and scientists&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GUI era: Expanded to office workers, creative professionals, and technically-inclined individuals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI era: Potentially accessible to anyone who can articulate a goal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evolution of computing interfaces has consistently followed a pattern of abstracting away technical complexity. AI represents the natural continuation of this trend-allowing humans to focus on what they want to accomplish rather than how to instruct a machine to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who have watched computing evolve over decades, this progression makes perfect sense. The transition from punch cards to keyboards, from command lines to graphical interfaces, and now from explicit instructions to goal-oriented requests, all follow the same trajectory: making computational power more accessible to more people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking Forward: Collaborative Computing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we move deeper into the AI era, weâre likely to see a shift from computers as tools to computers as collaborators. The most productive human-computer relationships may become more conversational-a back-and-forth refinement of goals and solutions rather than one-way instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesnât mean computers are becoming human or developing consciousness. Rather, theyâre evolving to better complement human cognition. Humans excel at setting goals, understanding context, and making value judgments. Computers excel at processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and executing precise instructions. AI allows each party to focus on what they do best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of computing isnât about replacing human intelligence but extending it-creating a partnership where the line between giving instructions and setting goals becomes increasingly blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this light, AI isnât a revolutionary break from computingâs past-itâs the natural next step in the computerâs evolution toward becoming a more helpful, accessible, and intuitive extension of human capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
