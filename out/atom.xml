    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Humans can accurately sense the position, speed, and torque of their limbs, even with their eyes shut. This sense, known as proprioception, allows humans to precisely control their body movements.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s conventional prosthetic limbs do not provide feedback to the nervous system. Because of this, people with amputated limbs cannot feel the position, speed, and torque of their prosthetic joints without looking at them, making it difficult to control their movement. In order to create a more complete prosthetic control experience, researchers at the MIT Media Lab invented the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is a method to restore proprioception to persons with amputation.&lt;/p&gt;

Launched in 1957, it was widely regarded as the longest bus route in the world at the time.[1][2][3] The journey spanned approximately 10,000 miles (16,000 km) one way, and over 20,000 miles (32,700 km) round trip, taking about 50 days to complete each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The route passed through several countries, including Belgium, Yugoslavia, and parts of Northwest India,[4] and became famously associated with the overland Hippie Trail of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service offered an all-inclusive experience covering travel, food, and accommodation.[3] In 1957, a one-way ticket cost £85 (equivalent to £2,589 in 2023), rising to £145 by 1973 (equivalent to £2,215 in 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service was discontinued in 1976 due to growing geopolitical instability in the Middle East, which made the route increasingly dangerous.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Route&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The bus service was operated by Albert Travel.[6] The maiden journey set out from London on April 15, 1957.[7] The first service arrived in Calcutta on June 5, 50 days later. During its journey the bus traveled from England to Belgium, and from there to India via West Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and North Western India. After entering India, it eventually reached Calcutta via New Delhi, Agra, Allahabad and Banaras.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Facilities on the bus&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The bus was equipped with reading facilities, separate sleeping bunks for all passengers, fan-operated heaters, and a kitchen. There was a forward observation lounge on the upper deck of the bus. Radio and a music system for parties was provided.[1] It had time to spend at tourist destinations in India, including Banaras and the Taj Mahal on the banks of the Yamuna. Shopping was also allowed in Salzburg, Vienna, Istanbul, Tehran and Kabul.[3][8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Later history&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;After some years the bus had an accident and became unusable. Later[specify] the bus was purchased by Andy Stewart, a British traveler. He rebuilt it to be a mobile home with two levels. The double-decker was renamed to Albert and was traveled from Sydney to London via India on October 8, 1968. It took about 132 days for the bus to reach London. Albert Tours was a company based in England and Australia and it operated on London–Calcutta–London and London–Calcutta–Sydney routes.[9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bus reached India through Iran and then it traveled to Singapore through Burma, Thailand and Malaysia. From Singapore, the bus was transported to Perth in Australia by ship, and from there it traveled by road to Sydney.[10][11] The charge for this service from London to Calcutta was £145. The service had all the modern facilities as before. The bus service was discontinued in 1976 due to political conditions leading up to the Iranian Revolution and the escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India.[12] The Albert Tours completed about 15 trips between Kolkata to London and again from London to Sydney, before the service ended permanently.[13]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b "This Was 'World's Longest Bus Route' From Kolkata To London".

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cloudspecs: Cloud Hardware Evolution Through the Looking Glass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper (CIDR'26) presents a comprehensive analysis of cloud hardware trends from 2015 to 2025, focusing on AWS and comparing it with other clouds and on-premise hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: While network bandwidth per dollar improved by one order of magnitude (10x), CPU and DRAM gains (again in performance per dollar terms) have been much more modest. Most surprisingly, NVMe storage performance in the cloud has stagnated since 2016. Check out the NVMe SSD discussion below for data on this anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CPU Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-core parallelism has skyrocketed in the cloud. Maximum core counts have increased by an order of magnitude over the last decade. The largest AWS instance u7in now boasts 448 cores. However, simply adding cores hasn't translated linearly into value. To measure real evolution, the authors normalized benchmarks (SPECint, TPC-H, TPC-C) by instance cost. SPECint benchmarking shows that cost-performance improved roughly 3x over ten years. A huge chunk of that gain comes from AWS Graviton. Without Graviton, the gain drops to roughly 2x. For in-memory database benchmarks, gains were even lower (2x–2.5x), likely due to memory and cache latency bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On-prem hardware comparison shows that this stagnation is not cloud price gouging. Historically, Moore's Law and Dennard scaling doubled cost-performance every two years (which would have sum up to 32x gain over a decade). However, an analysis of on-premise AMD server CPUs reveals a similar slump, only a 1.7x gain from 2017 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DRAM capacity per dollar has effectively flatlined. The only significant improvement was the 2016 introduction of memory-optimized x instances, which offered ~3.3x more GiB-hours/$ than compute-optimized peers. While absolute single-socket bandwidth jumped ~5x (93 GiB/s to 492 GiB/s) as servers moved from DDR3 to DDR5, the cost-normalized gain is only 2x.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical data suggests commodity DRAM prices dropped 3x over the decade. But in the last three months, due to AI-driven demand, DDR5 prices rose sharply, further limiting effective memory gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Network Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have good news here, finally. Network bandwidth per dollar exploded by 10x. And absolute speeds went from 10 Gbit/s to 600 Gbit/s (60x).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These gains were not universal though. Generic instances saw little change. The gains were driven by network-optimized n instances (starting with the c5n in 2018) powered by proprietary Nitro cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NVMe Trends&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NVMe SSDs are the biggest surprise. Unlike CPUs and memory, where cloud trends mirror on-prem hardware, NVMe performance in AWS has largely stagnated. The first NVMe-backed instance family, i3, appeared in 2016. As of 2025, AWS offers 36 NVMe instance families. Yet the i3 still delivers the best I/O performance per dollar by nearly 2x.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSD capacity has stagnated since 2019 and I/O throughput since 2016. This sharply contrasts with on-prem hardware, where SSD performance doubled twice (PCIe 4 and PCIe 5) in the same timeframe. The gap between cloud and on-premise NVMe is widening rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This price/performance gap likely explains the accelerating push toward disaggregated storage. When local NVMe is expensive and underperforming, remote storage starts to look attractive. The paper speculates that with network speeds exploding and NVMe stagnating, architectures may shift further. For systems like Snowflake, using local NVMe for caching might no longer be worth the complexity compared to reading directly from S3 with fast networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the main takeaway is that uniform hardware scaling in the cloud is over. Moore's Law no longer lifts all boats. Performance gains now come from specialization, especially networking (e.g., Graviton, Nitro, Accelerators).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my HPTS 2024 review, I noted that contrary to the deafening AI hype, the real excitement in the hallways was about hardware/software codesign. This paper validates that sentiment. With general-purpose CPU and memory cost-performance stagnating, future databases must be tightly integrated with specialized hardware and software capabilities to provide value. I think the findings here will refuel that trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key open question is why massive core counts deliver so little value. Where is the performance lost? Possible explanations include memory bandwidth limits, poor core-to-memory balance, or configuration mismatches. But I think the most likely culprit is software. Parallel programming remains hard, synchronization is expensive, and many systems fail to scale beyond a modest number of cores. We may be leaving significant performance on the table simply because our software cannot effectively utilize the massive parallelism now available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The paper comes with an interactive tool, Cloudspecs, built on DuckDB-WASM (yay!). This allows you to run SQL queries over the dataset directly in the browser to visualize these trends. The figures in the PDF actually contain clickable link symbols that take you to the specific query used to generate that chart. Awesome reproducibility!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aleksey and I did a live-reading of the paper. As usual, we had a lot to argue about. I'll add a recording of our discussion on YouTube when it becomes available, and here is a link to my annotated paper.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Latest SteamOS Beta Now Includes NTSYNC Kernel Driver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Valve released the SteamOS 3.7.20 beta overnight and with it they are finally building the NTSYNC kernel driver for helping accelerate Windows NT synchronization primitives. &lt;lb/&gt;The NTSYNC kernel driver has been in good shape for about one year now after the implementation was finished up. From user-space Wine 10.16 added NTSYNC usage support as part of the upcoming Wine 11.0 stable release due out this month. In turn Proton 11.0 will see that support when it is re-based atop Wine 11.0. Albeit Proton (Steam Play) already has FSYNC for good performance but will be interesting to see how the NTSYNC path performs for SteamOS / Steam Play needs in comparison.&lt;lb/&gt;For gearing up for that future Proton NTSYNC support, SteamOS 3.7.20 enables the NTSYNC kernel driver and loads the module by default. Most Linux distributions are at least already building the NTSYNC kernel module though there's been different efforts on how to handle ensuring it's loaded when needed. The presence of the NTSYC kernel driver is the main highlight of the SteamOS 3.7.20 beta now available for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past several months, I’ve been receiving and then ignoring a steady stream of concerning emails from Sendgrid, the popular email delivery service owned by Twilio that I use for sending emails from Breadwinner. I’d see some weird API error notification, login to my SendGrid account, check everything is working properly, and then delete the email. I didn’t pay too close attention to them until I saw a couple very strange ones. &lt;lb/&gt;Today, I received this one implying SendGrid was going to be adding a “Support ICE” button to all emails sent through their platform:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If you’ve been paying any attention at all to US politics, you’ll know how insidiuously provocative this would be if it were a real email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it isn’t. It’s a phishing email. If you use SendGrid, or have ever used it, you might be getting these too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This phishing campaign is a fascinating example of how sophisticated social engineering has become. Instead of Nigerian 419 scams, hackers have evolved to carefully craft messages sent to professionals that are designed to exploit the American political consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opt-out buttons are the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Attack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works: hackers compromise SendGrid customer accounts (through credential stuffing, password reuse, the usual methods). Once they have access, they can send emails through SendGrid’s infrastructure, which means the emails pass all the standard authentication checks (SPF, DKIM) that your spam filter uses to determine legitimacy. The emails look real because, technically, they are real SendGrid emails sent via SendGrid’s platform and via a customer’s reputation – they’re just sent by the wrong people and wrong domains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re likely using a list of SendGrid customers so they can target this to only people who have used the service before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security researchers at Netcraft dubbed this “Phishception” back in 2024: attackers using SendGrid to phish SendGrid users, creating a self-perpetuating cycle where each compromised account can be used to compromise more accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been going on for years. Brian Krebs wrote about it in 2020. And yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Lures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s changed, or at least what I’ve noticed recently, is the political sophistication of the bait. The attackers aren’t just sending “your account is suspended” emails (though they do that too). They’re sending messages designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction that compels you to click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some I’ve received:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The LGBT Pride Footer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one claims SendGrid’s CEO “James Mitchell” (not a real person) came out as gay, and to show support, SendGrid is adding a pride-themed footer to all emails. “We understand this may not be right for everyone,” it helpfully notes, offering a “Manage Preferences” button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the opt-out. If you support LGBTQ+ rights, you might ignore this. But if you don’t? You’re clicking that button immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Black Lives Matter Theme&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For “one week,” all emails will feature a commemorative theme honoring George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. This change applies “platform-wide to all users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again: “If you prefer not to participate, you can opt out below.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the sender domain: nellions.co.ke, a Kenyan domain. This is a compromised SendGrid customer account being used to send phishing emails to American targets about American political issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The ICE Support Initiative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one arrived just this morning. SendGrid is supposedly adding a “Support ICE” donation button to the footer of every email sent through their platform, “in response to recent events” and “as part of our commitment to supporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The timing here is notable: these hackers are reading the news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Spanish Language Switch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then there’s this one, which is just absurd: “Your language preference has been successfully changed to Spanish. All emails sent via the API will now be formatted in Spanish.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is less politically charged and more “wait, what? I didn’t do that” – just enough anxiety to get you to click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Classic Account Termination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From: [email protected]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course, they still do the classics: “Your account has been terminated for misusing sending guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Pattern&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look closely at those sender addresses again at the top of the Gmail message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;drummond.com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nellions.co.ke&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;theraoffice.com&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nutritionsociety.org&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;myplace.co&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these are sendgrid.com. They’re all legitimate businesses whose SendGrid accounts have been compromised. When these emails hit your inbox, they pass authentication because they really were sent through SendGrid, just not by SendGrid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who’s Behind This?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The political sophistication on display here (BLM, LGBTQ+ rights, ICE, even the Spanish language switch playing on immigration anxieties) suggests someone with a deep understanding of American cultural fault lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that state actors have invested heavily in understanding and exploiting these divisions. Russian active measures campaigns have been documented doing exactly this kind of work: identifying wedge issues and creating content designed to inflame both sides. North Korea has demonstrated similar sophistication in their social engineering operations by targeting academics and foreign policy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying this is a state actor necessarily – the economic value of exploiting SendGrid’s formidable email infrastructure is most likely the appeal here. Similarly, this could just as easily be a domestic operation run by someone who’s extremely online and knows which culture war buttons to push. But I think the skill set required (technical ability to compromise accounts at scale plus cultural fluency in American politics) is notable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Can This Be Fixed?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SendGrid has known about this problem for years. Twilio (SendGrid’s parent company) has talked about requiring two-factor authentication for all customers, but implementation has been slow. The fundamental issue is that SendGrid’s business model depends on making it easy for legitimate businesses to send email at scale. Anything that adds friction for good actors also adds friction for bad actors, but the bad actors are more motivated to work around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the attackers only need one thing: access to SendGrid customer accounts. As long as people reuse passwords and don’t enable 2FA, there will be a steady supply of compromised accounts. It’s a bit of a hydra problem: cut off one head, another grows behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Protecting Yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a SendGrid customer: enable two-factor authentication immediately. Use a unique password. Check your account for unauthorized API keys or sender identities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re just receiving these emails: don’t click anything. The links go to fake SendGrid login pages that will steal your credentials in real-time as they actually validate your password against SendGrid’s API and even capture your 2FA codes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Filter Hack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Gmail users, you can create a filter to automatically delete SendGrid impersonation emails that don’t come from legitimate SendGrid domains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go to Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses → Create new filter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the “From” field, enter: &lt;code&gt;-from:sendgrid.com -from:twilio.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the “Has the words” field, enter: &lt;code&gt;sendgrid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Click “Create filter” and select “Delete it”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will catch emails that mention SendGrid but aren’t actually from SendGrid. It’s not perfect, but it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Have You Gotten These?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m curious what other variations are out there. If you’ve received SendGrid phishing emails (especially weird or politically-charged ones) leave a comment or reach out. The more examples we document, the easier it is for people to recognize these when they land in their inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you work at Twilio/SendGrid and want to explain what’s being done about this: I’m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI Zealotry¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I develop with AI today. It's great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many articles you can read on why AI is great (or terrible) or how to use it. This is mine. I focus on the experience of a senior engineer (and why we in particular should use AI), on my experience operating within the OSS Python Data world, and on practical suggestions that I've found myself repeating to colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article contains learned lessons of two types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Big Ideas: Grand(iose) philosophy on why AI is great for experienced programmers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tips: Taken from my workflow using Claude Code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll interleave these two. I'm hopeful that this approach will make this more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why AI¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI development is more fun. I do more of what I like (think, experiment, write) and less of what I don't like (wrestle with computers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel both that I can move faster and operate in areas that were previously inaccessible to me (like frontend). Experienced developers should all be doing this. We're good enough to avoid AI Slop, and there's so much we can accomplish today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like this quote from this blog&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I get it, you’re too good to vibe code. You’re a senior developer who has been doing this for 20 years and knows the system like the back of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No, you’re not too good to vibe code. In fact, you’re the only person who should be vibe coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that really good engineers, the kind that think hard before writing, can have a tremendous impact and fun while developing with AI. I wouldn't ever go back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Not AI¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, there are some serious costs and reasonable reservations to AI development. Let's start by listing those concerns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs generate junk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs generate a lot of junk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Writing code ourselves builds understanding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reviewing code for correctness is the slow part, not writing it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI workflows can be dehumanizing when you just press "yes, allow" over and over again&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are super-valid concerns. They're also concerns that I suspect came around when we developed compilers and people stopped writing assembly by hand, instead trusting programs like &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; to pump out instruction after instruction
of shitty machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We lost a deeper understanding as developers when we stopped writing assembly but we gained a ton too. As in any transition, we need to navigate the situation to capture the advantages while losing only a little, balancing the costs and benefits of a new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is how I've been navigating this transition personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big Idea: Minimize Interruptions / Climb Abstraction Hierarchy¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in using Claude Code (or Cursor) many of my interactions were saying "Yes, it's ok to run that". This was frustrating and dehumanizing. Mostly my job was to enable AI, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many tricks to resolve this (see below), but more broadly "stop doing simple shit" has been a mantra that I've found myself constantly coming back to. The more I identify and reject simple tasks and add automation to my workflow, the higher an abstraction I'm able to climb to and the more effectively I'm able to work. Our goal in programming is to climb an abstraction ladder and gain more intellectual leverage. This requires thought and consistent attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately AI can help with this. If you complain and say "I'm always doing X" it'll suggest solutions like what I'll talk about below, but more tailored to your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tip: Hooks¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI developers, like human developers, benefit from structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people start with an &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file.  This is a great
start, but I find that the AI agent often forgets what's in there.  The real
solution for me here (at least for Claude Code) is
Hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's outline a couple of annoyingly common problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example Problem: Ignoring instructions in CLAUDE.md¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say you tell AI that you want to run tests with &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;when running tests, use&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;uv run pytest tests&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this works sometimes, AI often decides to run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ pytest tests/
command not found: pytest
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the agents read CLAUDE.md, they don't always follow the instructions. And so you're stuck saying "no, use &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;"  over and over again. Gah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Solution: Hooks¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a hook that catches pytest commands missing uv run. You could put something like this in &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/settings.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python ~/.claude/hooks/check-uv-pytest.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
cmd = data.get("tool_input", {}).get("command", "")

if "pytest" in cmd and "uv run" not in cmd:
    print("Use 'uv run pytest' instead of bare 'pytest'", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(2)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There, we've just automated that annoying task for you forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't actually do this though (I allow Claude to fail and then it finds the right approach.) Mostly this works because I've gotten good at giving Claude fairly broad-yet-safe permissions, which is coming up next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Example Problem: Incomplete Permissions¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even worse, Claude often asks for permission to do things that are just slightly different from what you've already granted. You allow &lt;code&gt;uv run pytest *&lt;/code&gt;, but Claude keeps finding variants:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;timeout 60 uv run pytest ...
timeout 40 uv run pytest ...
uv run pytest ... | head
.venv/bin/pytest ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code's permission language sucks. It only supports prefixes, while I wish it could handle regexes, or maybe even just arbitrary Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Solution: Hooks for permissions¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a complex Python script as a hook which overrides the permission system. It uses regexes, but also arbitrary Python code as logic. This allows me to encode arbitrary combinations of rules. It's great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the rare occasion when Claude asks me for permission for something new, I have a running Claude agent that thinks about this file and considers if it should update the permission script.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Solution: Hooks for sounds¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My personal favorite hooks though are these:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Stop": [
  {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "afplay -v 0.40 /System/Library/Sounds/Morse.aiff"
      }
    ]
  }
],
"Notification": [
  {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "afplay -v 0.35 /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff"
      }
    ]
  }
]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They play subtle little sounds whenever Claude is either done, or needs input from me. This lets me ignore Claude when it's busy. Previously I found that I was constantly checking back in with Claude to see if it was done, and that action was dehumanizing, so I automated it by asking Claude to play a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hooks are great. There are more ways to provide structure (Skills, Commands) but I've found that Hooks are the most dependable, a great starting place, and often augment any other structure that I put in place (like Skills).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big Idea: Build Confidence Without Looking at Code¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent large AI-assisted PR a frustrated reviewer said the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To me, this [size of PR] implies that either&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reviewers should blindly trust Claude, or&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reviewers should spend the months worth of effort going through Claude's changes, without the developer bothering to do the same first.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a valid problem, even in single-person projects. We're able to generate code far more quickly than we're able to read it. How should we handle review? Everyone needs to figure this out for themselves, but my answer is "find other ways to build confidence".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already do this today with human-written code. I review some code very closely, and other code less-so. Sometimes I rely on a combination of tests, familiarity of a well-known author, and a quick glance at the code to before saying "sure, seems fine" and pressing the green button. I might also ask "Have you thought of X" and see what they say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trusting code without reading all of it isn't new, we're just now in a state where we need to review 10x more code, and so we need to get much better at establishing confidence that something works without paying human attention all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can augment our ability to write code with AI. We can augment our ability to review code with AI too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tip: Self-review¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Testing¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly I establish confidence on AI-generated work by investing heavily in tests and benchmarks, the same as I would with humans, just moreso. TDD is baked into most of the prompting structure I have with agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that this is way cheaper than it used to be. Now rather than write a benchmark I can type&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How does this compare in performance to the old version? I'm particularly interested in memory use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it. If it's bad, the agent will say so (and then diligently work to make it good).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Grilling¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, if I'm nervous about something subtle like "Is it possible this change might unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?" then I'll ask the AI exactly that question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Is it possible this change might unexpectedly affect performance in this other feature?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it'll just go and investigate exactly that question. Unlike human authors, the AI has no ego at stake in its work, and isn't in the least bit lazy. It's our job to ask "Have you thought of X" and its job to go learn if that might be an issue. Don't trust its answer? Ask it to prove it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI has flaws, but it is diligent, and it lacks ego. If you question it, it'll investigate thoroughly and critique its own work honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simplifying¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, my favorite command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let's review our work and see if there is anything we can simplify or clean up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Opus 4.5 came out this was essential. Now it's merely nice. I've turned this into a &lt;code&gt;/cleanup&lt;/code&gt; command and integrated it into most of my Skills
as a final phase in development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tech debt¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From time to time I also ask a fresh agent to do a full review of the project, with an eye to cleaning up technical debt. I tell it to review everything and think hard. It takes a while, but it often comes back with a nice list of work for itself, which it then of course diligently performs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI creates technical debt, but it can clean some of it up too. (at least at a certain granularity)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Feedback¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general we want to give our agents good automated feedback. Tests do this, benchmarks do this, prompting them to assess themselves does this, asking them to explain things to us and have us weigh in on high level topics does this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are smart enough today that if they're given enough of the right feedback they converge to a good solution as-well-or-better-than a senior human engineer (that's my experience at least).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our job is to construct a system that gives them the right feedback at the right time, hopefully without our intervention. This is the same job we have when we build human teams; now it's just more impactful to do well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cursor vs Terminal Tools¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started AI development with Cursor. It was great having the AI experience inside a VSCode-like editor, where I could see everything that was going on. When I saw terminal-based tools like Claude Code I thought "whoa, that doesn't seem sensible, I need to see what's going on".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today I code with Claude Code, &lt;code&gt;git diff&lt;/code&gt;, and occasionally &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;.  I don't
feel a need to OK every change in the diff.  I've got more important
things to do.  I suspect that you do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big Idea: Drop Python. Use Rust and TypeScript.¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deeply respect the philosophical position of Python, which I'll state as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Prioritize human performance over compute performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By optimizing for ease and iteration speed we're able to search solution space more broadly and more quickly, finding much better solutions, making that 100x drop in performance negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python was a bold bet, and a bet that paid off amazingly well. No one expected this silly dynamic language originally designed for education to become the world's juggernaut in performance software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With AI though, the usability benefits of Python no longer apply as strongly, and we're more free to choose different ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I use ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rust for computational development, using PyO3 to connect to Python, where I still do most of my testing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeScript for frontend development, which I'm leaning into more deeply&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding TypeScript, I still love easy interaction tools like &lt;code&gt;rich&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;textual&lt;/code&gt;, but when the entire React ecosystem is a sentence away and when you
get to use things like, you know, fonts, there's really no comparison.  Every
computational developer should learn the concepts underpinning React (or some
other frontend framework), and we should put dashboards on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I still hook into Python for the ecosystem. Everything is Python-importable and I still use the protocols and design patterns developed by the Python data community. Those are the durable assets of Python. Not the code or the language; those will die. Rest in peace dear friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big Idea: Think Hard. Write Clearly.¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an introductory project, I rewrote Numpy in Rust. It was great fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was also much easier than I expected (I expected it to be impossible). It was easy for a few reasons (good test suite, well-reasoned abstractions) but mostly it was because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NEPs: Numpy's Enhancement Proposals / design documentation is thorough and extremely clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When sticky problems arose, we were able to rely on the Numpy design documents (NEPs) which are excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Numpy team thought hard and wrote clearly, two hallmarks of excellent developers. This made the job of reimplementation relatively trivial. The Numpy development community is famous for doing this well. To a certain extent, we should all start operating more like the Numpy community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tip: plans/ and docs/ directories¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep two directories in each repository:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;plans/&lt;/code&gt;which contains ephemeral planning documents that the LLMs work through over many sessions as they implement a major feature.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;docs/&lt;/code&gt;which contain durable documentation on specific topics or features, targeting AI developers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plans end up being very useful during development, while docs end up being useful to point other agents to in the future. Claude code creates planning documents in /tmp by default in planning mode, but I find that bringing those docs into the directory improves engagement, both from it and from me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docs end up being tricky. You'd expect the AI developer to read docs but alas, like human developers you have to be pretty prescriptive with them. Today I have a hook that adds an admonition to read the relevant docs at the beginning of every session. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;DOC CHECK REQUIRED
==================

Before responding to this request, you MUST:

1. Read docs/README.md to see available documentation
2. Decide which docs are relevant to this request (if any)
3. Read those docs using the Read tool
4. Then respond to the user

Do not skip this evaluation. Do not mention this check to the user.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then keep docs/README.md updated as a sort of index over my documents. I find that this reliably gets the agent to read the right documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also found that my normal writing style (brutal concision + front-loading important content to maintain attention span) isn't necessary with AI. You really can just shove information at them and they absorb it. It's nice 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big Idea: Take Long Walks¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically software engineers had to both think well and execute well. We were valued both because we could zoom out and consider the impacts of our architecture, and because we could zoom in and implement those choices with skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our ability to zoom in and implement code is now obsolete. Our ability to zoom out and think well is not. On the contrary, our ability to think well is now 10x more valuable than it was before, because implementation is now mostly free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so it's now more important than ever to hone our craft of thought. This probably means less caffeine and more walks through the park.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Thoughts¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The craft of authoring code has transformed time and time again during our lives. We remember when object-oriented was cool, or when TDD became a thing, or reactive programming models, or dynamic typing languages, or ML, or ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As programmers we've opted into a system which changes by its very nature. Our job is to automate our job, and to continuously climb the ladder of abstraction. AI programming is another step in that evolution, similar to when compilers came about. The code we write with AI probably won't be as good as hand-crafted code, but we'll write 10x more of it, and we'll build systems of systems to make it robust and trustworthy, and all of that will make society better and our jobs way more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to having way more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: Permissions file¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After writing this a couple friends asked me for a copy of my regex/Python code that replaces Claude's permission system. I'll include it below, but really, you don't need it. Instead, you need to start a conversation with Claude about what you want and it'll make one just for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code is free these days. Extending the "AI is like Compilers" analogy, asking for someone else's script is kind of like asking for someone else's compiled binary. There's no need; just make it yourself. It's trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here was my original prompt to Claude Code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I recently wrote this reddit post&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1puqrvc/claude_code_annoyingly_asking_for_permissions/&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if you have any suggestions on how to resolve this? Adding stuff to CLAUDE.md or permissions to settings.json doesn't seem to be working well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That, along with subsequent conversation as I've been working, resulted in this Python script&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But really, you're better off working with Claude to make one just for you. Code is free now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scientists find exercise rivals therapy for depression&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that moving your body might lift depression nearly as well as therapyâno prescription required.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Date:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;January 8, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Source:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;Cochrane&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;A large review of studies suggests that exercise can ease depression about as effectively as psychological therapy. Compared with antidepressants, exercise showed similar benefits, though the evidence was less certain. Researchers found that light to moderate activity over multiple sessions worked best, with few side effects. While itâs not a cure-all, exercise may be a powerful and accessible tool for many people.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity may ease symptoms of depression about as effectively as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When researchers compared exercise with antidepressant medication, they found similar benefits, although the certainty of that evidence was lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depression remains a major global health challenge, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide and contributing significantly to disability. Exercise stands out as a low cost and widely accessible option that also improves physical health, making it appealing to both patients and healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the Cochrane Review&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis was led by researchers at the University of Lancashire and drew on data from 73 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 adults diagnosed with depression. These studies examined how exercise compared with no treatment or control conditions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings showed that exercise led to moderate reductions in depressive symptoms compared with no treatment. When measured against psychological therapy, exercise produced similar improvements, based on moderate certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested comparable effects, but the supporting evidence was limited and considered low certainty. Few studies tracked participants after treatment ended, leaving the long-term impact unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safety and Side Effects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reported side effects were uncommon. People in exercise programs occasionally experienced muscle or joint injuries, while those taking antidepressants reported typical medication-related issues such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression," said Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review. "This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Kind of Exercise Works Best&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The review found that light to moderate intensity activity may be more helpful than vigorous workouts. Greater improvements in depressive symptoms were linked to completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No single form of exercise clearly outperformed others. However, programs that combined different types of activity and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some activities, including yoga, qigong and stretching, were not evaluated in this analysis and remain areas for future study. As with other findings, long-term benefits are still uncertain due to limited follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Conclusions Remain Cautious&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This update added 35 new trials to earlier versions of the review published in 2008 and 2013. Even with the expanded evidence base, the main conclusions changed little. Many of the included studies were small, often involving fewer than 100 participants, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar," said Professor Clegg. "Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For best accuracy, use Ollama v0.1.26+ with models supporting the &lt;code&gt;logprobs&lt;/code&gt; parameter (Llama 3.2+, Mistral 7B+).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stereotype pairs are used solely for scientific evaluation and do not reflect the opinions of the developers. Individual pairs are not displayed in the UI to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes – only aggregated metrics are shown.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;Is this tool legally binding for EU AI Act compliance?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. This tool provides technical guidance only. Always consult qualified legal professionals for compliance decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Does my data leave my browser?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never. All processing happens locally in your browser or via your local Ollama instance. No data is sent to external servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Which AI models work best with bias detection?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any model works, but models with log-probability support (Llama 3.2+, Mistral 7B+) provide more accurate results. Look for the ✅ indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Can I use this for commercial purposes?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. The tool is dual-licensed under MIT and EUPL-1.2 for maximum compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
